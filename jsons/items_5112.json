We will read these articles and book excerpts carefully - \"deep reading,\" it is called - to discover how good writers take basic journalism and enliven it with literary technique. We want to catalog as much of that technique and structure as we can so that we can \"steal it,\" appropriate the devices for our own work. Students will work in teams; each week a team will \"present\" the readings and incite a discussion with the rest of the class. There will be some three to five formal academic papers in which students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of the material, and there will be a number of \"creative\" assignments as well. The main text for the course is an excellent anthology of non-fiction: The Art of Fact by Kerrane and Yagoda.             Permalink             [x] close.

As web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \u201cnew\u201d environmental journalism take? This class will begin by tracing the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and will then look closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we will confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing and the scientific process. And yes, we will produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar will include intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.

The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians.

What does our culture\u2019s \u201cmedia\u201d tell us about its ideas of gender? What, if anything, does our gender tell us about our readings of \u201cmedia\u201d? Student participation in this seminar is key: students are expected to attend all sessions, to complete all the reading (there's lots of reading!), to participate actively in discussion, and to lead one of the class sessions themselves. Leading a class means opening the day\u2019s conversation with a presentation, critiquing and elaborating on the assigned reading, bringing in additional relevant material, and suggesting questions or issues that seem particularly interesting or troublesome. The purpose of the course is to develop our critical and self-critical faculties as journalists, media critics, consumers of media, and women or men\u2014to think clearly, challenge our pet assumptions, and have fun. Along with attendance and informed class participation, students are required to conduct a miniresearch project and present their findings to the class. I want you to pick a \u201cwomen and media\u201d topic that really interests you and then report the hell out of it. If you\u2019re interested in the effect of music videos on teenage girls, for instance, you would first put together an extensive bibliography of what has already been written on the subject. You would figure out what the key questions in the field were: do media images affect teens\u2019 behavior or not, and how can anyone tell? You might interview some of the leading researchers in the area and tell us what they say. You\u2019ll certainly want to read the most important books/articles on your subject. A paper is not required; instead, students will present their findings to the class during our last three sessions.

There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world. Comprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s. We will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent. Today, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing. We will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.             Permalink             [x] close.

No computers. No cell phones in class. Pencil and yellow legal sized paper only. Please be on time. Bring a jacket and a metro card. For the first class, there is absolute silence when you enter the room. No talking. Not even to say hello to your neighbor. You want to hear a hello? Here it is: Hello. Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.   Before each class, you will be expected to read the following excerpts from \u201cA Nietzsche Reader\u201d (Penguin) translated by R. J. Hollingdale. They are not long, but they are important. We may alter this list based on my assessment of your abilities . Reading assignments in Gary Smith and Micheal Herr\u2019s books, as well as our Marvel Comic class, will be assigned as we go deeper into the semester and I am able to assess your abilities.

This course will provide an introduction to the basic principles of research, reporting and writing the news. You will be introduced to a variety of ways in which we work in this fast paced, deadline driven business - from writing in the traditional newspaper pyramid style to opinion and feature writing to working for broadcast, and new media. You will do lots of writing because the only way to work on your skills is to practice it over and over.   To be a good reporter you have to be informed about what's happening in the world around you. For this class, you have to read The New York Times, New York Daily News and The New York Post every day. You must watch at least 15 minutes of television news or listen to news radio a day. You must also scan the free papers. (Metro &amp; AM NEW YORK) Once a week you will have a brief news quiz on the big stories of the week and your score will count toward your final grade.   In each class one or two students will take turns leading \"Newscheck,\" which is a discussion on a story of their choosing from the front pages of The New York Times. Everyone must participate in the discussion. Working journalists will visit throughout the semester. You will be expected to ask well thought out questions and take notes because you will have to write a 600-word story on each newsroom visitor. These stories will be due the day after they are assigned.   We will start out with obits and profiles where you will learn the nuances of storytelling and build up to writing a 1,000-word final news story on an issue of your choosing. This story should be good enough to be published. You will cover news events. We will get into this city's diverse colorful neighborhoods and find stories and spend lots of time exploring and hunting down news in New York City.   If a big story breaks, prepare to cover it. On any given day in the newsroom you have no idea what is going to happen. Be flexible! I can guarantee you that things will change as we go through our semester.

Students will be expected to keep weeky beat notes or blogs, exploring what is current in the topic and demonstrating week after week the shoeleather they have worn in pursuit of their subject matter. Out of this work will come four or five stories in narrative, explanatory or investigative style, depending on the instructor and the specific assignment.

From Day 1, we are metro reporters who will hone our craft covering the biggest and most vibrant municipality in the nation. You will learn to research report and write authoritatively on New York City and all its problems and issues.   This is not a lecture class per se, so you will be out covering stories all over the Big Apple and then bringing them back to write on deadline. I will stress the news feature which will require a good amount of reporting before a piece is turned in but don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to go cover something on our beat on deadline.   You will sharpen your interviewing techniques and learn to follow up breaking news with insightful analytical pieces to go to the heart of the issue.\u00a0 You will develop a keen eye for detail and your copy must reflect the details of each piece so readers are transported to the scene through your writing.   To be an effective metro reporter you must be a local news junkie, so scouring the big dailies is a must for this class, hence the New York Times, New York Daily News and the New York Post are must-reads before class.

In this intensive skills course, you will zero in on a neighborhood/community in which New Yorkers determinedly straddle and embrace dual identities, bringing vibrancy and diversity to this city. You may cover your chosen beat through a variety of lenses, such as: \u2022 Zeroing in on individuals who have achieved success and others who struggle; \u2022 Profiling local institutions and businesses; \u2022 Examining a neighborhood's/community\u2019s historical and political underpinnings; \u2022 Focusing on a community's or individual\u2019s cultural/professional contributions.   Your beat may be a community defined by its residents' lands of origin (the Russians of Brighton Beach, Koreans of \"Koreatown\" [Manhattan], Albanians of Arthur Avenue], Indians of \"Curry Row\" [Manhattan], Irish of Woodlawn [Queens]), or by their race, religion, ethnicity or identity (Harlem USA, Chassidic Crown Heights, Downtown LGBT). Whether your story is about a place or an individual, an organization or an event, your writing must always capture the human side of the news- the heart of feature journalism. You will be guided in coming up with and pursuing great, fresh story ideas within your beat, in writing four graded pieces (three shorter ones and one more in-depth final), and in finding appropriate venues to pitch them. (Getting clips \u2013 not just grades - is one of the aims of this course.) The goal here is learning how to craft strong, captivating stories featuring memorable characters and settings - with much emphasis upon resourceful newsgathering and responsible presentation of facts and events, vivid color and detail, coherent and graceful structure, and impeccable mechanics (spelling, grammar, punctuation). A key focus of your reporting and writing will be to broaden your readers\u2019 perspective (and your own) on the cultural/ethnic/socioeconomic milieu of your subjects. This class will provide you with opportunities to write stories that are genuinely publishable, on subjects that genuinely interest you. You will be encouraged to write creatively and gorgeously, and even to try to change the world\u2026but your product must retain the clarity, concision and precision that were drummed into you in your basic reporting classes, stopping far short of \u201cfan-like,\u201d gushy prose, blinding passions, or fictional license.

In this course, students plot their own journey, inspired by classics old and new. We\u2019ll learn quest hallmarks like the role of obstacles, character, location, guides, gurus and skeptics, doubt and myth \u2013 and all-important narrative structure using present, past, future, suspense and flashback.   Students warm up for their 3,000-word magazine package in linked features that may include themes like The Place, The Guide, The Big Dare, Fish Out of Water, and In-The-Footsteps. Throughout, we\u2019ll work on balancing first with third person, detailed reporting with personal experience -- all while finding your authentic voice. Past student seekers have learned to motorcycle, studied stand-up comedy, overcome an addiction, lived with the homeless and hunted literary and historic myths from J.D. Salinger\u2019s New York to hidden Grand Central Station. What\u2019s your Holy Grail? In this class, you may find it. THE QUEST SPIRIT: This semester, we will pursue group and individual odysseys. It is crucial that everyone participate in both. In that spirit, you will be asked to set your personal goals for the semester in writing. You will also be asked to actively contribute and shape how we move forward as a group. This is an experimental, first-time format blending ancient and modern literature with contemporary journalism, so everyone will be asked to row on our maiden voyage.   \u00a0   Professor Bio: Jessica Seigel has covered arts, business and technology as a columnist and staffer for The Chicago Tribune, Brill\u2019s Content and Pink Magazine.

Home is a rich journalistic topic because it sits at the convergence of so many important things -- shelter, aspiration, self-expression, family, love, hate, childhood, adulthood. Home is where the hearth is, but also where the heart is.   In this course, a student might write about a lighthouse keeper and his life of solitude, nuns in a convent in the Bronx, a family that lives on a bobbing houseboat by the Hudson River piers, or a young couple who work as live-in caretakers at the Edgar Allen Poe House. Homes and their inhabitants are infinitely varied. There are nursing homes, squats, and artist communes; there are immigrants whose homes are statements of their foreign cultures and values; there are nannies whose homes are in fact other people\u2019s homes.   Because our homes reveal our values, dreams and interests, an article about a person\u2019s home is also an article about that person. Imagine a young techno geek, gripped by his ambition to launch an Internet startup; his distracted, obsessed consciousness is perfectly reflected in his apartment strewn with software code and electronic devices and hardly a place to sit. Or imagine a group of nuns who decide to put a green roof on their convent to satisfy their ecological beliefs. Or imagine an artist who lives for her art, who has an all-white apartment -- and who is happy to explain what her vision of beauty is.   \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0             Permalink             [x] close.

The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians.

What does our culture\u2019s \u201cmedia\u201d tell us about its ideas of gender? What, if anything, does our gender tell us about our readings of \u201cmedia\u201d? Student participation in this seminar is key: students are expected to attend all sessions, to complete all the reading (there's lots of reading!), to participate actively in discussion, and to lead one of the class sessions themselves. Leading a class means opening the day\u2019s conversation with a presentation, critiquing and elaborating on the assigned reading, bringing in additional relevant material, and suggesting questions or issues that seem particularly interesting or troublesome. The purpose of the course is to develop our critical and self-critical faculties as journalists, media critics, consumers of media, and women or men\u2014to think clearly, challenge our pet assumptions, and have fun. Along with attendance and informed class participation, students are required to conduct a miniresearch project and present their findings to the class. I want you to pick a \u201cwomen and media\u201d topic that really interests you and then report the hell out of it.

You would figure out what the key questions in the field were: do media images affect teens\u2019 behavior or not, and how can anyone tell? You might interview some of the leading researchers in the area and tell us what they say. You\u2019ll certainly want to read the most important books/articles on your subject. A paper is not required; instead, students will present their findings to the class during our last three sessions.

Issues and Ideas: Covering Sub-Saharan Africa             Monday 3:30pm-6:00pm             Frankie Edozien                                   Issues and Ideas: Covering Sub-Saharan Africa             Instructor: Frankie Edozien             Course ID: JOUR-UA 505.001             Days: Monday 3:30pm-6:00pm             Room: 20 Cooper Square, room 655             &raquo; Syllabus (PDF)             Challenges, Issues and Ideas in Covering Sub-Saharan Africa Africa covers a vast area of 55 countries and 1.1 billion inhabitants. There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world. Comprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s. We will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent. Today, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing. We will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.             Permalink             [x] close.

They will also learn how to use data to perform investigative journalism. Outstanding examples of data journalism from around the world will be studied -- and the techniques those pieces used will be added to students' arsenals.

No computers. No cell phones in class. Pencil and yellow legal sized paper only. Please be on time. Bring a jacket and a metro card. For the first class, there is absolute silence when you enter the room. No talking. Not even to say hello to your neighbor. You want to hear a hello? Here it is: Hello. Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.   Before each class, you will be expected to read the following excerpts from \u201cA Nietzsche Reader\u201d (Penguin) translated by R. J. Hollingdale. They are not long, but they are important. We may alter this list based on my assessment of your abilities . Reading assignments in Gary Smith and Micheal Herr\u2019s books, as well as our Marvel Comic class, will be assigned as we go deeper into the semester and I am able to assess your abilities.

This course will provide an introduction to the basic principles of research, reporting and writing the news. You will be introduced to a variety of ways in which we work in this fast paced, deadline driven business - from writing in the traditional newspaper pyramid style to opinion and feature writing to working for broadcast, and new media. You will do lots of writing because the only way to work on your skills is to practice it over and over.   To be a good reporter you have to be informed about what's happening in the world around you. For this class, you have to read The New York Times, New York Daily News and The New York Post every day. You must watch at least 15 minutes of television news or listen to news radio a day. You must also scan the free papers. (Metro &amp; AM NEW YORK) Once a week you will have a brief news quiz on the big stories of the week and your score will count toward your final grade.   In each class one or two students will take turns leading \"Newscheck,\" which is a discussion on a story of their choosing from the front pages of The New York Times. Everyone must participate in the discussion. Working journalists will visit throughout the semester. You will be expected to ask well thought out questions and take notes because you will have to write a 600-word story on each newsroom visitor. These stories will be due the day after they are assigned.   We will start out with obits and profiles where you will learn the nuances of storytelling and build up to writing a 1,000-word final news story on an issue of your choosing. This story should be good enough to be published. You will cover news events. We will get into this city's diverse colorful neighborhoods and find stories and spend lots of time exploring and hunting down news in New York City.   If a big story breaks, prepare to cover it. On any given day in the newsroom you have no idea what is going to happen. Be flexible! I can guarantee you that things will change as we go through our semester.

From Day 1, we are metro reporters who will hone our craft covering the biggest and most vibrant municipality in the nation. You will learn to research report and write authoritatively on New York City and all its problems and issues.   This is not a lecture class per se, so you will be out covering stories all over the Big Apple and then bringing them back to write on deadline. I will stress the news feature which will require a good amount of reporting before a piece is turned in but don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to go cover something on our beat on deadline.   You will sharpen your interviewing techniques and learn to follow up breaking news with insightful analytical pieces to go to the heart of the issue.\u00a0 You will develop a keen eye for detail and your copy must reflect the details of each piece so readers are transported to the scene through your writing.

This course is designed to hone the student journalist's ability to research and report deeply and to be able to imagine and develop fresh ideas, test them with the strength of his or her reporting and resarch, and then to present them in story form. Students will be expected to keep weeky beat notes or blogs, exploring what is current in the topic and demonstrating week after week the shoeleather they have worn in pursuit of their subject matter. Out of this work will come four or five stories in narrative, explanatory or investigative style, depending on the instructor and the specific assignment. Syllabi differ by content of the course but all sections emphasize idea development, interview technique, reporting, background research and writing skills across genres. Broadcast sections vary only by medium.   ---   This course will serve as an introduction to various schools of media criticism and ways in which different types of media can be interpreted. What is the traditional role of the journalist and how is it changing?\u00a0 What new theoretical capacities must be analyzed in order to understand the current state of media? This course will look at early critiques of media to the present and will incorporate critical analysis form a variety of perspectives from critical discourse to ideological criticism to market and public journalism based models. While many pundits are sure that modern news media is in a state of flux, few are fully informed of earlier critiques of media from Marx to Dewey to the New Journalists of the 1960\u2019s, each of which provided a critical lens for analyzing journalism and media. In this course through a variety of writing assignments, in-class and take home critiques, and through serious critical analysis of modern media in all of its various permutations students will analyze the ways in which media can be studied.\u00a0 Ideally students will leave the class with a set of critical tools to use in analyzing mass media and the inherent difficulties facing major news organizations in all of their various permutations.

This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious  libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won  in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in  1964. Students will examine freedom of the press through the prism of a rich  variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel, newsgathering problems,  the right of privacy, prior restraint, and the conflict between free press  and fair trial. Readings include a The First Amendment and  the Fourth Estate; Make No  Law by Anthony Lewis, The  Unwanted Gaze by Jeffrey Rosen, and Origins of the Bill of Rights by Leonard  Levy.

This does not mean that students will be taught \"theories\" of cultural writing, which they can then apply to their \"practice.\" Rather, the point is that your thought process-as you write a piece, as you prepare to write it, or even before that, as you go through your daily life in a world full of potential subject matter-is an integral part of your work as a writer. We all carry on some kind of conversation with ourselves, and with the people we know, about the culture we live in. As writers, however, our task is to self-consciously translate that private conversation into a public one that connects with readers. In this course I ask you to address two questions that bear on this translation. One is historical: what has been said in the cultural conversation before you came to it? To find your place in the conversation (just as you would have to do if you joined a roomful of people talking) you will need to grapple with cultural issues and debates that go back half a century-debates about the nature of art and criticism, technology and mass media, high culture versus mass culture, art and politics, social groups and cultural difference. The second question is personal: what experiences, ideas, emotions, and prejudices do you bring to the conversation? While conventional news writers are simply expected to put their own attitudes aside, cultural journalists must be conscious of their standpoint and its impact on their observation and judgment. Your credibility and the power of your literary voice depend a good deal on your ability to develop this capacity for self-reflection. Open to CRC students only.

Our goal is to introduce ourselves to some of the best cultural critics (mainly of the 20th century); chart the ways in which the nature of 20th-century criticism \u2014 and art \u2014 have changed; investigate some of the major questions that preoccupy contemporary critics (especially the nature of modernism/postmodernism, high and low culture, irony and sincerity, and the culture wars); and begin to master some forms of critical writing. The paradox of how to develop a critical voice without writing directly about oneself will be explored. Among the critics we'll study are James Agee, Pauline Kael, John Berger, George Orwell, Gilbert Seldes, Susan Sontag, Lionel Trilling, Greil Marcus, Albert Murray, Norman Mailer and Wendy Steiner.

You spent a good deal of time on the basics \u2013 on research methods, sourcing, interview technique, note-taking, story organization, grammar, style and deadlines, tapping the resources of this great city all the while. The downbeat was accurate and evocative reporting, solid research and reporting and lively, well-organized stories.

More work on all of the above plus a new heavy emphasis on voice and originality, analysis, descriptive acuity, long-form structure and exquisite narrative technique in both short turnaround and longer deadline assignments.

The course is broken into three elements: (1) hands-on non-linear editing - students are given the raw elements from a story previously broadcast on CBS News (the Diet Project) and edit their version of the project in a simulated broadcast environment. (2) dissecting video story telling styles in the news magazine and long-form genre. (3) Integrating these learned editing techniques to the students\u2019 documentary work. There is class time dedicated to one-on-one editing sessions. Students may work with AVID, Final Cut Pro 7 or both to do their editing. It is important to understand that this course is not a \u201chow-to-use editing software\u201d. For what it\u2019s worth, Professor Spungen is fluent in editing with AVID software and is happy to answer any AVID related questions. His knowledge of FCP7 is not as strong, however all attempts will be made to help students with FCP7 questions.             Permalink             [x] close.

One is to finish your long piece. The other is to produce a short piece for our Election Special. You will work in groups of 2 for the election stories and then report live from various locations on election night as a follow-up to your reports. We will discuss this in class tonight and you will pitch stories on 9/21. This is very much a workshop class. You will present your work during the various stages of production\u2014developing your story, reviewing your raw tapes, scripts and rough-cuts during class. Each of you will develop a schedule with deadlines for both stories and submit this by 9/28. During class, I will also bring in tapes to discuss that will stimulate discussion of form and content. Classes may run past 8:00 PM as we get more involved in story development so please don't schedule yourself too tightly on Wednesdays. Before you edit your election pieces, I will conduct an AVID session to give you some shortcuts. If you want to work on FCP, you have access to the 504 A computers, but you will compete with all the other students for time on those machines. Our final class is Dec 14. From past experience, that is not enough time to view all projects so I suggest we also meet on the 15th. We can meet in the afternoon as well since formal classes are over on the 14th. If you need the time, we could also have our last meeting on 12/19. Please do not schedule airline tickets before then. We will also pick a date in early February for your film festival screening. We normally have it on a Saturday, be we could try for a Friday. Please choose from Jan 28 or Feb 4. Parents and friends, of course, are invited.

Unlike other professionals, journalists must make their ethical decisions rapidly, often without clear guidelines, and on their own, and the results of their decisions are open to public view. Also unlike other professionals, violations of ethical precepts are not punished by professional discipline or revocation of a license. This makes it vital that journalists weigh the value of how and what they choose to report against the potential harm to subjects, sources and society as a whole. The objective of this course is to provide guidance, through consideration of hypothetical and actual situations and analysis of case decisions, in developing a framework to help you make ethical and legal professional choices and to suggest some criteria against which those decisions may be measured.

Readings and discussion will focus on making sense of the large shifts that accompany the move to digital production and distribution in professional journalism, including the \"always on\" web, the lower barriers to entry, the rise of social media and \"the people formerly known as the audience,\" the ease of production using digital tools, the \"unbundling\" of news packages that were well adapted to prior platforms, the loss of monopoly status among news organizations, and the re-voicing of journalism in a more interactive environment for news. By comparing press ethics under the \"old\" system and the new codes that have emerged in the digital era, students will be able to hone in on what is different for professional journalists today, which is knowledge they will need for the remainder of the Studio 20 program.

Some documentary photographers approach a subject with a clear agenda for prescriptive\u00a0   change, some come with a direction, technique, or a subject area, some come seeking answers, often\u00a0   in the form of stories or essays, and others seek to portray a psychological reality or state of mind. In\u00a0   many cases, a new understanding of the world, or at least one aspect of the world, is achieved.\u00a0   Besides imparting an understanding of this process, this course poses the question: How will you\u00a0   document the social, political, economic, and cultural issues of today and cultivate a narrative with\u00a0   still images?\u00a0   \u00a0   How will you document a neighborhood of your city; how will you interpret what you see when you\u00a0   look through your viewfinder?

We will explore how to take advantage of the two main sources of information documents and people and discuss when and how to use computer data to both enhance a story or provide the foundation for a major project. Throughout the course, the goal will be to constantly delve beneath the surface. Going deep is the essence of investigative reporting, which pulls together all publicly available information, as well as harder-to-find material, to present the fullest possible picture. Corporations and powerful individuals employ armies of PR experts, lawyers and lobbyists to ensure that only their version of reality prevails, and it is the lonely duty of journalists to dispel this fog of self-interest. At least as important as mastering the technical skills will be learning to think critically and skeptically. The relentlessly upbeat press release, the carefully worded SEC filing or the late-Friday-afternoon earnings statement each, as a matter of course, should be probed for accuracy and omission.

Her book on women in the middle east is coming out in the fall.\u00a0   Over the last five years, newspapers and magazines based in the United States have closed dozens of foreign bureaus; today, only a handful of publications maintain any kind of full-time overseas presence. Meanwhile, dwindling reporting budgets mean that U.S.-based writers seeking foreign assignments have an increasingly hard case to make. While all this is bad news for readers, it represents a tremendous opportunity for journalists with the energy and flexibility to strike out on their own abroad. \"This course is intended for American students who are considering a stint reporting from overseas, as well as for students of other nationalities who would like to establish themselves writing for American outlets when they return home. We\u2019ll examine the kinds of story ideas that, when you\u2019re starting out, are most likely to set you apart from the competition and interest editors who aren\u2019t yet familiar with your writing. We\u2019ll address the tricky business of securing a stream of short-term, bread-and-butter assignments while also pursuing the kinds of complex stories that may require months or even years to report. We\u2019ll discuss practical concerns, such as how to work most effectively with translators and fixers, and how to form and maintain good relationships with editors many time zones away. We\u2019ll also survey the growing group of organizations that fund reporting projects overseas through fellowships and travel grants. Perhaps most important, we\u2019ll read some of the most exciting new writing from overseas, all of it by journalists who got their start freelancing abroad. We\u2019ll consider the work of now-established writers such as Wendell Steavenson, Peter Hessler, and Eliza Griswold, as well as writing by younger reporters, including Laura Kasinof, Joshua Hersh, and Alexis Okeowo. Many of these journalists have lived much closer to their subjects than American reporters overseas traditionally have, and we\u2019ll look at how that increased intimacy has benefited their work, as well as the difficulties and ethical questions it may have raised. Through our readings, we\u2019ll also examine the challenges of observing social change in an unfamiliar context, and of reporting on beliefs that we may find troubling or even abhorrent. Diminished budgets for overseas reporting, and the near-extinction of staff foreign correspondents, are among the most widely lamented aspects of the crisis in journalism. But there has never been a better time to be a journalism student with a passport and a keen eye for a story.\"      Syllabus coming soon.     emphasis on practical solutions to frequently encountered problems. Topics will   include composing a seductive lede, translating jargon and technical arcana for\u00a0   lay readers, wresting vivid scenes from dull subjects, and the ethics of handling\u00a0   sources. We\u2019ll study how various journalists, writing about figures in a broad range\u00a0   of fields, from politics and finance to scholarship and the arts, have negotiated the\u00a0   profile\u2019s challenges. We\u2019ll read pieces by the genre\u2019s most talented practitioners and\u00a0   meet some of those journalists in class. Along the way, students will acquire a sense\u00a0   of the idea profile\u2019s historical trajectory, from its antecedents among New York\u00a0   intellectuals in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s and the New Journalism of the 1960s\u00a0   to its flowering in recent decades, in magazines like Lingua Franca, The New York\u00a0   Times Magazine, Vanity Fair, and The New Yorker             Permalink             [x] close.

Students will select a topic and will spend the semester researching it. Once the research is underway, we will practice incorporating it into literary nonfiction, a technique that can help transform prose from mundane to masterful. The final project will be a long reported piece. We will also read writers who use research in creative and invigorating ways.

We will read these articles and book excerpts carefully - \"deep reading,\" it is called - to discover how good writers take basic journalism and enliven it with literary technique. We want to catalog as much of that technique and structure as we can so that we can \"steal it,\" appropriate the devices for our own work. Students will work in teams; each week a team will \"present\" the readings and incite a discussion with the rest of the class. There will be some three to five formal academic papers in which students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of the material, and there will be a number of \"creative\" assignments as well. The main text for the course is an excellent anthology of non-fiction: The Art of Fact by Kerrane and Yagoda.             Permalink             [x] close.

As web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \u201cnew\u201d environmental journalism take? This class will begin by tracing the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and will then look closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we will confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing and the scientific process. And yes, we will produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar will include intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.

The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians.

What does our culture\u2019s \u201cmedia\u201d tell us about its ideas of gender? What, if anything, does our gender tell us about our readings of \u201cmedia\u201d? Student participation in this seminar is key: students are expected to attend all sessions, to complete all the reading (there's lots of reading!), to participate actively in discussion, and to lead one of the class sessions themselves. Leading a class means opening the day\u2019s conversation with a presentation, critiquing and elaborating on the assigned reading, bringing in additional relevant material, and suggesting questions or issues that seem particularly interesting or troublesome. The purpose of the course is to develop our critical and self-critical faculties as journalists, media critics, consumers of media, and women or men\u2014to think clearly, challenge our pet assumptions, and have fun. Along with attendance and informed class participation, students are required to conduct a miniresearch project and present their findings to the class. I want you to pick a \u201cwomen and media\u201d topic that really interests you and then report the hell out of it. If you\u2019re interested in the effect of music videos on teenage girls, for instance, you would first put together an extensive bibliography of what has already been written on the subject. You would figure out what the key questions in the field were: do media images affect teens\u2019 behavior or not, and how can anyone tell? You might interview some of the leading researchers in the area and tell us what they say. You\u2019ll certainly want to read the most important books/articles on your subject. A paper is not required; instead, students will present their findings to the class during our last three sessions.

There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world. Comprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s. We will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent. Today, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing. We will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.             Permalink             [x] close.

No computers. No cell phones in class. Pencil and yellow legal sized paper only. Please be on time. Bring a jacket and a metro card.

Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.   Before each class, you will be expected to read the following excerpts from \u201cA Nietzsche Reader\u201d (Penguin) translated by R. J. Hollingdale. They are not long, but they are important.

In each class one or two students will take turns leading \"Newscheck,\" which is a discussion on a story of their choosing from the front pages of The New York Times. Everyone must participate in the discussion. Working journalists will visit throughout the semester. You will be expected to ask well thought out questions and take notes because you will have to write a 600-word story on each newsroom visitor. These stories will be due the day after they are assigned.   We will start out with obits and profiles where you will learn the nuances of storytelling and build up to writing a 1,000-word final news story on an issue of your choosing. This story should be good enough to be published. You will cover news events. We will get into this city's diverse colorful neighborhoods and find stories and spend lots of time exploring and hunting down news in New York City.   If a big story breaks, prepare to cover it. On any given day in the newsroom you have no idea what is going to happen. Be flexible! I can guarantee you that things will change as we go through our semester.

From Day 1, we are metro reporters who will hone our craft covering the biggest and most vibrant municipality in the nation. You will learn to research report and write authoritatively on New York City and all its problems and issues.   This is not a lecture class per se, so you will be out covering stories all over the Big Apple and then bringing them back to write on deadline. I will stress the news feature which will require a good amount of reporting before a piece is turned in but don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to go cover something on our beat on deadline.   You will sharpen your interviewing techniques and learn to follow up breaking news with insightful analytical pieces to go to the heart of the issue.\u00a0 You will develop a keen eye for detail and your copy must reflect the details of each piece so readers are transported to the scene through your writing.   To be an effective metro reporter you must be a local news junkie, so scouring the big dailies is a must for this class, hence the New York Times, New York Daily News and the New York Post are must-reads before class.

In this intensive skills course, you will zero in on a neighborhood/community in which New Yorkers determinedly straddle and embrace dual identities, bringing vibrancy and diversity to this city. You may cover your chosen beat through a variety of lenses, such as: \u2022 Zeroing in on individuals who have achieved success and others who struggle; \u2022 Profiling local institutions and businesses; \u2022 Examining a neighborhood's/community\u2019s historical and political underpinnings; \u2022 Focusing on a community's or individual\u2019s cultural/professional contributions.   Your beat may be a community defined by its residents' lands of origin (the Russians of Brighton Beach, Koreans of \"Koreatown\" [Manhattan], Albanians of Arthur Avenue], Indians of \"Curry Row\" [Manhattan], Irish of Woodlawn [Queens]), or by their race, religion, ethnicity or identity (Harlem USA, Chassidic Crown Heights, Downtown LGBT). Whether your story is about a place or an individual, an organization or an event, your writing must always capture the human side of the news- the heart of feature journalism. You will be guided in coming up with and pursuing great, fresh story ideas within your beat, in writing four graded pieces (three shorter ones and one more in-depth final), and in finding appropriate venues to pitch them. (Getting clips \u2013 not just grades - is one of the aims of this course.) The goal here is learning how to craft strong, captivating stories featuring memorable characters and settings - with much emphasis upon resourceful newsgathering and responsible presentation of facts and events, vivid color and detail, coherent and graceful structure, and impeccable mechanics (spelling, grammar, punctuation). A key focus of your reporting and writing will be to broaden your readers\u2019 perspective (and your own) on the cultural/ethnic/socioeconomic milieu of your subjects. This class will provide you with opportunities to write stories that are genuinely publishable, on subjects that genuinely interest you. You will be encouraged to write creatively and gorgeously, and even to try to change the world\u2026but your product must retain the clarity, concision and precision that were drummed into you in your basic reporting classes, stopping far short of \u201cfan-like,\u201d gushy prose, blinding passions, or fictional license.

Subject matter varies from section to section, but the basic skeleton of the course is the same across sections: the emphasis is on development of the ability to produce writing and reporting within a sophisticated longform story structure. The course involves query writing, topic research and reading, interviewing, and repeated drafts and rewrites, leading to a full-length piece of writing aimed at a publishable level and the ability of the student to present the reporting orally.   ---   Advanced Reporting: The Quest The quest is at the heart of our greatest stories, from Odysseus returning home to reporter Nellie Bly\u2019s race around the world in less than 80 days. In this course, students plot their own journey, inspired by classics old and new. We\u2019ll learn quest hallmarks like the role of obstacles, character, location, guides, gurus and skeptics, doubt and myth \u2013 and all-important narrative structure using present, past, future, suspense and flashback.   Students warm up for their 3,000-word magazine package in linked features that may include themes like The Place, The Guide, The Big Dare, Fish Out of Water, and In-The-Footsteps. Throughout, we\u2019ll work on balancing first with third person, detailed reporting with personal experience -- all while finding your authentic voice. Past student seekers have learned to motorcycle, studied stand-up comedy, overcome an addiction, lived with the homeless and hunted literary and historic myths from J.D. Salinger\u2019s New York to hidden Grand Central Station. What\u2019s your Holy Grail? In this class, you may find it. THE QUEST SPIRIT: This semester, we will pursue group and individual odysseys. It is crucial that everyone participate in both. In that spirit, you will be asked to set your personal goals for the semester in writing. You will also be asked to actively contribute and shape how we move forward as a group.

Subject matter varies from section to section, but the basic skeleton of the course is the same across sections: the emphasis is on development of the ability to produce writing and reporting within a sophisticated longform story structure. The course involves query writing, topic research and reading, interviewing, and repeated drafts and rewrites, leading to a full-length piece of writing aimed at a publishable level and the ability of the student to present the reporting orally.   ---   The topic of this Capstone course is home, in all its guises. Home is a rich journalistic topic because it sits at the convergence of so many important things -- shelter, aspiration, self-expression, family, love, hate, childhood, adulthood. Home is where the hearth is, but also where the heart is.   In this course, a student might write about a lighthouse keeper and his life of solitude, nuns in a convent in the Bronx, a family that lives on a bobbing houseboat by the Hudson River piers, or a young couple who work as live-in caretakers at the Edgar Allen Poe House. Homes and their inhabitants are infinitely varied. There are nursing homes, squats, and artist communes; there are immigrants whose homes are statements of their foreign cultures and values; there are nannies whose homes are in fact other people\u2019s homes.   Because our homes reveal our values, dreams and interests, an article about a person\u2019s home is also an article about that person. Imagine a young techno geek, gripped by his ambition to launch an Internet startup; his distracted, obsessed consciousness is perfectly reflected in his apartment strewn with software code and electronic devices and hardly a place to sit. Or imagine a group of nuns who decide to put a green roof on their convent to satisfy their ecological beliefs. Or imagine an artist who lives for her art, who has an all-white apartment -- and who is happy to explain what her vision of beauty is.   \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0             Permalink             [x] close.

We want to catalog as much of that technique and structure as we can so that we can \"steal it,\" appropriate the devices for our own work. Students will work in teams; each week a team will \"present\" the readings and incite a discussion with the rest of the class. There will be some three to five formal academic papers in which students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of the material, and there will be a number of \"creative\" assignments as well.

As web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \u201cnew\u201d environmental journalism take? This class will begin by tracing the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and will then look closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we will confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing and the scientific process.

The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians.

What does our culture\u2019s \u201cmedia\u201d tell us about its ideas of gender? What, if anything, does our gender tell us about our readings of \u201cmedia\u201d? Student participation in this seminar is key: students are expected to attend all sessions, to complete all the reading (there's lots of reading!), to participate actively in discussion, and to lead one of the class sessions themselves. Leading a class means opening the day\u2019s conversation with a presentation, critiquing and elaborating on the assigned reading, bringing in additional relevant material, and suggesting questions or issues that seem particularly interesting or troublesome. The purpose of the course is to develop our critical and self-critical faculties as journalists, media critics, consumers of media, and women or men\u2014to think clearly, challenge our pet assumptions, and have fun. Along with attendance and informed class participation, students are required to conduct a miniresearch project and present their findings to the class. I want you to pick a \u201cwomen and media\u201d topic that really interests you and then report the hell out of it. If you\u2019re interested in the effect of music videos on teenage girls, for instance, you would first put together an extensive bibliography of what has already been written on the subject. You would figure out what the key questions in the field were: do media images affect teens\u2019 behavior or not, and how can anyone tell? You might interview some of the leading researchers in the area and tell us what they say. You\u2019ll certainly want to read the most important books/articles on your subject. A paper is not required; instead, students will present their findings to the class during our last three sessions.

There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world. Comprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s. We will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent. Today, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing. We will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.             Permalink             [x] close.

Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.

This course will provide an introduction to the basic principles of research, reporting and writing the news. You will be introduced to a variety of ways in which we work in this fast paced, deadline driven business - from writing in the traditional newspaper pyramid style to opinion and feature writing to working for broadcast, and new media. You will do lots of writing because the only way to work on your skills is to practice it over and over.   To be a good reporter you have to be informed about what's happening in the world around you. For this class, you have to read The New York Times, New York Daily News and The New York Post every day. You must watch at least 15 minutes of television news or listen to news radio a day. You must also scan the free papers. (Metro &amp; AM NEW YORK) Once a week you will have a brief news quiz on the big stories of the week and your score will count toward your final grade.   In each class one or two students will take turns leading \"Newscheck,\" which is a discussion on a story of their choosing from the front pages of The New York Times. Everyone must participate in the discussion. Working journalists will visit throughout the semester. You will be expected to ask well thought out questions and take notes because you will have to write a 600-word story on each newsroom visitor. These stories will be due the day after they are assigned.   We will start out with obits and profiles where you will learn the nuances of storytelling and build up to writing a 1,000-word final news story on an issue of your choosing. This story should be good enough to be published. You will cover news events. We will get into this city's diverse colorful neighborhoods and find stories and spend lots of time exploring and hunting down news in New York City.   If a big story breaks, prepare to cover it. On any given day in the newsroom you have no idea what is going to happen. Be flexible! I can guarantee you that things will change as we go through our semester.

From Day 1, we are metro reporters who will hone our craft covering the biggest and most vibrant municipality in the nation. You will learn to research report and write authoritatively on New York City and all its problems and issues.   This is not a lecture class per se, so you will be out covering stories all over the Big Apple and then bringing them back to write on deadline. I will stress the news feature which will require a good amount of reporting before a piece is turned in but don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to go cover something on our beat on deadline.   You will sharpen your interviewing techniques and learn to follow up breaking news with insightful analytical pieces to go to the heart of the issue.\u00a0 You will develop a keen eye for detail and your copy must reflect the details of each piece so readers are transported to the scene through your writing.   To be an effective metro reporter you must be a local news junkie, so scouring the big dailies is a must for this class, hence the New York Times, New York Daily News and the New York Post are must-reads before class.

This course will look at early critiques of media to the present and will incorporate critical analysis form a variety of perspectives from critical discourse to ideological criticism to market and public journalism based models. While many pundits are sure that modern news media is in a state of flux, few are fully informed of earlier critiques of media from Marx to Dewey to the New Journalists of the 1960\u2019s, each of which provided a critical lens for analyzing journalism and media.

This does not mean that students will be taught \"theories\" of cultural writing, which they can then apply to their \"practice.\" Rather, the point is that your thought process-as you write a piece, as you prepare to write it, or even before that, as you go through your daily life in a world full of potential subject matter-is an integral part of your work as a writer. We all carry on some kind of conversation with ourselves, and with the people we know, about the culture we live in. As writers, however, our task is to self-consciously translate that private conversation into a public one that connects with readers. In this course I ask you to address two questions that bear on this translation. One is historical: what has been said in the cultural conversation before you came to it? To find your place in the conversation (just as you would have to do if you joined a roomful of people talking) you will need to grapple with cultural issues and debates that go back half a century-debates about the nature of art and criticism, technology and mass media, high culture versus mass culture, art and politics, social groups and cultural difference. The second question is personal: what experiences, ideas, emotions, and prejudices do you bring to the conversation? While conventional news writers are simply expected to put their own attitudes aside, cultural journalists must be conscious of their standpoint and its impact on their observation and judgment. Your credibility and the power of your literary voice depend a good deal on your ability to develop this capacity for self-reflection. Open to CRC students only.

The paradox of how to develop a critical voice without writing directly about oneself will be explored. Among the critics we'll study are James Agee, Pauline Kael, John Berger, George Orwell, Gilbert Seldes, Susan Sontag, Lionel Trilling, Greil Marcus, Albert Murray, Norman Mailer and Wendy Steiner.

You will learn to write clearly and concisely, and to produce news stories on deadline. These are skills you will need to master no matter what medium you work in-newspapers, websites, magazines, TV or radio-and whether you aspire to report on local, national or international topics. During this first half of a two-semester course, we will focus on news and beat reporting because they are the backbone of journalism. We will learn by doing, with reporting and writing assignments inside and outside class. Our lab will be New York City, which is rich in stories that can challenge the most seasoned reporters. We will begin by learning the basics of news reporting: story organization, interview techniques, developing sources, research methods, and grammar and style. Through classroom discussions, field trips and guest speakers, we will explore journalistic practices and how they are changing.

You spent a good deal of time on the basics \u2013 on research methods, sourcing, interview technique, note-taking, story organization, grammar, style and deadlines, tapping the resources of this great city all the while. The downbeat was accurate and evocative reporting, solid research and reporting and lively, well-organized stories. Ethics, cultural awareness, news judgment, analytical skills development and other reporting considerations especially important in the global sphere figured heavily, as did your introduction to multimedia skills.\u00a0In WRR II, we\u2019ll have two alternating drumbeats meant to deepen, amplify, and enhance the skills you will need as working professionals. More work on all of the above plus a new heavy emphasis on voice and originality, analysis, descriptive acuity, long-form structure and exquisite narrative technique in both short turnaround and longer deadline assignments.   We will work in a three-week rhythm: Story assignment workshops and exercises one week; Thesis workshops the next; and Multimedia every third week.\u00a0We will work in themes rather than ethnic neighborhoods as past WRR II classes have done. This is our conceit: We are correspondents based in New York City who cover the city not for the city, but for other locales. That could mean as a national reporter or as a reporter for a publication in another country. It\u2019s the most basic notion of foreign corresponding: making the place you are reporting from come alive in a truthful, factual, engaging way to those who cannot be there or do not know it.\u00a0   \u00a0   Open to GloJo students only.

Through careful reading and exercises, we will attempt to discover how fine non-fiction books are made. We will read five book-length narratives (among them Praying for Sheetrock by Melissa Faye Greene, and The Duke of Deception by Geoff Wolf) then take those books apart, chapter by chapter, to discover what material the writer collected, how and why the writer organized that material and, finally, what structure the writer used to create a compelling narrative that attempts to hold the reader from first page to last. Seminar members, working in teams with protocols supplied by the instructor, will \"present\" the books for analysis and lead a discussion of them.

The course is broken into three elements: (1) hands-on non-linear editing - students are given the raw elements from a story previously broadcast on CBS News (the Diet Project) and edit their version of the project in a simulated broadcast environment. (2) dissecting video story telling styles in the news magazine and long-form genre. (3) Integrating these learned editing techniques to the students\u2019 documentary work. There is class time dedicated to one-on-one editing sessions. Students may work with AVID, Final Cut Pro 7 or both to do their editing. It is important to understand that this course is not a \u201chow-to-use editing software\u201d. For what it\u2019s worth, Professor Spungen is fluent in editing with AVID software and is happy to answer any AVID related questions. His knowledge of FCP7 is not as strong, however all attempts will be made to help students with FCP7 questions.             Permalink             [x] close.

One is to finish your long piece. The other is to produce a short piece for our Election Special. You will work in groups of 2 for the election stories and then report live from various locations on election night as a follow-up to your reports. We will discuss this in class tonight and you will pitch stories on 9/21. This is very much a workshop class. You will present your work during the various stages of production\u2014developing your story, reviewing your raw tapes, scripts and rough-cuts during class. Each of you will develop a schedule with deadlines for both stories and submit this by 9/28. During class, I will also bring in tapes to discuss that will stimulate discussion of form and content. Classes may run past 8:00 PM as we get more involved in story development so please don't schedule yourself too tightly on Wednesdays. Before you edit your election pieces, I will conduct an AVID session to give you some shortcuts. If you want to work on FCP, you have access to the 504 A computers, but you will compete with all the other students for time on those machines. Our final class is Dec 14. From past experience, that is not enough time to view all projects so I suggest we also meet on the 15th. We can meet in the afternoon as well since formal classes are over on the 14th. If you need the time, we could also have our last meeting on 12/19. Please do not schedule airline tickets before then. We will also pick a date in early February for your film festival screening. We normally have it on a Saturday, be we could try for a Friday. Please choose from Jan 28 or Feb 4. Parents and friends, of course, are invited.

Unlike other professionals, journalists must make their ethical decisions rapidly, often without clear guidelines, and on their own, and the results of their decisions are open to public view. Also unlike other professionals, violations of ethical precepts are not punished by professional discipline or revocation of a license. This makes it vital that journalists weigh the value of how and what they choose to report against the potential harm to subjects, sources and society as a whole. The objective of this course is to provide guidance, through consideration of hypothetical and actual situations and analysis of case decisions, in developing a framework to help you make ethical and legal professional choices and to suggest some criteria against which those decisions may be measured.

The goal throughout is be to understand and adopt the processes that the best science journalists use when they cover controversial science. You will learn how journalists interact with scientists, conduct research, organize information and write stories. Just as importantly, students also sharpen their analytical skills by writing almost every week for the SHERP webzine, Scienceline .

Readings and discussion will focus on making sense of the large shifts that accompany the move to digital production and distribution in professional journalism, including the \"always on\" web, the lower barriers to entry, the rise of social media and \"the people formerly known as the audience,\" the ease of production using digital tools, the \"unbundling\" of news packages that were well adapted to prior platforms, the loss of monopoly status among news organizations, and the re-voicing of journalism in a more interactive environment for news. By comparing press ethics under the \"old\" system and the new codes that have emerged in the digital era, students will be able to hone in on what is different for professional journalists today, which is knowledge they will need for the remainder of the Studio 20 program.

We will discuss the pleasures and pitfalls of writing about yourself as a character in serious nonfiction, the complexities of keeping your distance and coming too close, and of course, the interplay of experience and accuracy, memory and narrative.\u00a0 We\u2019ll look at personal narratives constructed for purposes of entertainment, advocacy, intellectual discovery, and even revenge.\u00a0 And we shall consider the always intriguing question raised by the first line of David Copperfield: \"Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must s how.\"\u00a0 We will examine essays which incorporate research and reportage, journeys and personal narratives, memoirs and deliberately constructed adventures. We will deliberately attempt the transformation of memoir and memory into personal essay, and of reported experience into personal essay. Our theme will be the use of the personal essay format, and the incorporation of the personal narrative voice, in strongly written pieces which address a wide variety of issues, at home (literally) and out in the great wide world. We will talk about the many options for presenting reported material, and about the advantages\u2014and pitfalls\u2014of the personal voice. We will talk about the writer\u2019s job of constructing that personal voice in an essay, and about the essential job of writing a personal essay which is about more than that personal voice and that personal perspective.

Others are specific to the work of American correspondents.

We will explore how to take advantage of the two main sources of information documents and people and discuss when and how to use computer data to both enhance a story or provide the foundation for a major project. Throughout the course, the goal will be to constantly delve beneath the surface. Going deep is the essence of investigative reporting, which pulls together all publicly available information, as well as harder-to-find material, to present the fullest possible picture. Corporations and powerful individuals employ armies of PR experts, lawyers and lobbyists to ensure that only their version of reality prevails, and it is the lonely duty of journalists to dispel this fog of self-interest. At least as important as mastering the technical skills will be learning to think critically and skeptically. The relentlessly upbeat press release, the carefully worded SEC filing or the late-Friday-afternoon earnings statement each, as a matter of course, should be probed for accuracy and omission.

Her book on women in the middle east is coming out in the fall.\u00a0   Over the last five years, newspapers and magazines based in the United States have closed dozens of foreign bureaus; today, only a handful of publications maintain any kind of full-time overseas presence. Meanwhile, dwindling reporting budgets mean that U.S.-based writers seeking foreign assignments have an increasingly hard case to make. While all this is bad news for readers, it represents a tremendous opportunity for journalists with the energy and flexibility to strike out on their own abroad. \"This course is intended for American students who are considering a stint reporting from overseas, as well as for students of other nationalities who would like to establish themselves writing for American outlets when they return home. We\u2019ll examine the kinds of story ideas that, when you\u2019re starting out, are most likely to set you apart from the competition and interest editors who aren\u2019t yet familiar with your writing. We\u2019ll address the tricky business of securing a stream of short-term, bread-and-butter assignments while also pursuing the kinds of complex stories that may require months or even years to report. We\u2019ll discuss practical concerns, such as how to work most effectively with translators and fixers, and how to form and maintain good relationships with editors many time zones away. We\u2019ll also survey the growing group of organizations that fund reporting projects overseas through fellowships and travel grants. Perhaps most important, we\u2019ll read some of the most exciting new writing from overseas, all of it by journalists who got their start freelancing abroad. We\u2019ll consider the work of now-established writers such as Wendell Steavenson, Peter Hessler, and Eliza Griswold, as well as writing by younger reporters, including Laura Kasinof, Joshua Hersh, and Alexis Okeowo. Many of these journalists have lived much closer to their subjects than American reporters overseas traditionally have, and we\u2019ll look at how that increased intimacy has benefited their work, as well as the difficulties and ethical questions it may have raised. Through our readings, we\u2019ll also examine the challenges of observing social change in an unfamiliar context, and of reporting on beliefs that we may find troubling or even abhorrent. Diminished budgets for overseas reporting, and the near-extinction of staff foreign correspondents, are among the most widely lamented aspects of the crisis in journalism. But there has never been a better time to be a journalism student with a passport and a keen eye for a story.\"      Syllabus coming soon.     emphasis on practical solutions to frequently encountered problems. Topics will   include composing a seductive lede, translating jargon and technical arcana for\u00a0   lay readers, wresting vivid scenes from dull subjects, and the ethics of handling\u00a0   sources.

They will also learn how to use data to perform investigative journalism. Outstanding examples of data journalism from around the world will be studied -- and the techniques those pieces used will be added to students' arsenals. A final project will test students\u2019 skills in using data to produce publishable-quality journalism.\u00a0\u00a0                                               Arthur L.

We will read these articles and book excerpts carefully - \"deep reading,\" it is called - to discover how good writers take basic journalism and enliven it with literary technique. We want to catalog as much of that technique and structure as we can so that we can \"steal it,\" appropriate the devices for our own work. Students will work in teams; each week a team will \"present\" the readings and incite a discussion with the rest of the class. There will be some three to five formal academic papers in which students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of the material, and there will be a number of \"creative\" assignments as well. The main text for the course is an excellent anthology of non-fiction: The Art of Fact by Kerrane and Yagoda.             Permalink             [x] close.

As web-based platforms increasingly dominate mass media, what specific forms should the \u201cnew\u201d environmental journalism take? This class will begin by tracing the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and will then look closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape. With the help of guests and timely readings, we will confront thorny questions about environmental advocacy, citizen media, issue framing, risk balancing and the scientific process. And yes, we will produce stories that matter on the biggest news beat of all. This advanced seminar will include intensive journalistic writing assignments, as well as extensive readings for in-class discussion.

The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians.

What does our culture\u2019s \u201cmedia\u201d tell us about its ideas of gender? What, if anything, does our gender tell us about our readings of \u201cmedia\u201d? Student participation in this seminar is key: students are expected to attend all sessions, to complete all the reading (there's lots of reading!), to participate actively in discussion, and to lead one of the class sessions themselves. Leading a class means opening the day\u2019s conversation with a presentation, critiquing and elaborating on the assigned reading, bringing in additional relevant material, and suggesting questions or issues that seem particularly interesting or troublesome. The purpose of the course is to develop our critical and self-critical faculties as journalists, media critics, consumers of media, and women or men\u2014to think clearly, challenge our pet assumptions, and have fun. Along with attendance and informed class participation, students are required to conduct a miniresearch project and present their findings to the class. I want you to pick a \u201cwomen and media\u201d topic that really interests you and then report the hell out of it. If you\u2019re interested in the effect of music videos on teenage girls, for instance, you would first put together an extensive bibliography of what has already been written on the subject. You would figure out what the key questions in the field were: do media images affect teens\u2019 behavior or not, and how can anyone tell? You might interview some of the leading researchers in the area and tell us what they say. You\u2019ll certainly want to read the most important books/articles on your subject. A paper is not required; instead, students will present their findings to the class during our last three sessions.

There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world. Comprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s. We will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent. Today, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing. We will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.             Permalink             [x] close.

Practice the skills and techniques professionals use to produce storytelling images. Learn to capture fleeting moments, document daily life and special events. By semester\u2019s end, you should have a basic understanding of the impact photographs have on society, the legal and ethical concerns of photojournalists, digital production of photographs, and the importance of captions and text accompanying photos. You should also have a variety of photojournalistic images suitable for an entry-level portfolio. \u2022 Learn to cover local events, develop your own story ideas, edit and scan your photographs using Adobe Photoshop, Elements, or other image-editing programs. Share your photos with classmates. \u2022 This is NOT a basic photography class. A portion of the class will be devoted to learning basic digital camera skills. The emphasis is on taking and editing good pictures. A basic understanding of camera operation and exposure is recommended.

No computers. No cell phones in class. Pencil and yellow legal sized paper only. Please be on time. Bring a jacket and a metro card. For the first class, there is absolute silence when you enter the room. No talking. Not even to say hello to your neighbor. You want to hear a hello? Here it is: Hello. Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.   There will be some reading aloud in class. There will be no bloodlettings. If you\u2019re willing to fail, you will be successful. If you\u2019re already a journalistic success, this isn\u2019t the class for you. Remember, writing is the act of continually failing at excellence, and uniformity is the ceiling against which great writing will forever bump. The mid term and final will be your writing.   Before each class, you will be expected to read the following excerpts from \u201cA Nietzsche Reader\u201d (Penguin) translated by R. J. Hollingdale. They are not long, but they are important. We may alter this list based on my assessment of your abilities .

To better understand what journalism has been and might be, students are also introduced to a selection of the best journalism, from Edward R. Murrow on migrant farm workers to Adrian Nicole LeBlanc on family life around the drug trade in the Bronx. Your work will be reading the assigned pieces, coming to class ready to comment on and question them, preparing for some tests and producing a paper of two during the semester.

This course will provide an introduction to the basic principles of research, reporting and writing the news. You will be introduced to a variety of ways in which we work in this fast paced, deadline driven business - from writing in the traditional newspaper pyramid style to opinion and feature writing to working for broadcast, and new media. You will do lots of writing because the only way to work on your skills is to practice it over and over.   To be a good reporter you have to be informed about what's happening in the world around you. For this class, you have to read The New York Times, New York Daily News and The New York Post every day. You must watch at least 15 minutes of television news or listen to news radio a day. You must also scan the free papers. (Metro &amp; AM NEW YORK) Once a week you will have a brief news quiz on the big stories of the week and your score will count toward your final grade.   In each class one or two students will take turns leading \"Newscheck,\" which is a discussion on a story of their choosing from the front pages of The New York Times. Everyone must participate in the discussion. Working journalists will visit throughout the semester. You will be expected to ask well thought out questions and take notes because you will have to write a 600-word story on each newsroom visitor. These stories will be due the day after they are assigned.   We will start out with obits and profiles where you will learn the nuances of storytelling and build up to writing a 1,000-word final news story on an issue of your choosing. This story should be good enough to be published. You will cover news events. We will get into this city's diverse colorful neighborhoods and find stories and spend lots of time exploring and hunting down news in New York City.   If a big story breaks, prepare to cover it. On any given day in the newsroom you have no idea what is going to happen. Be flexible! I can guarantee you that things will change as we go through our semester.

From Day 1, we are metro reporters who will hone our craft covering the biggest and most vibrant municipality in the nation. You will learn to research report and write authoritatively on New York City and all its problems and issues.   This is not a lecture class per se, so you will be out covering stories all over the Big Apple and then bringing them back to write on deadline. I will stress the news feature which will require a good amount of reporting before a piece is turned in but don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to go cover something on our beat on deadline.   You will sharpen your interviewing techniques and learn to follow up breaking news with insightful analytical pieces to go to the heart of the issue.\u00a0 You will develop a keen eye for detail and your copy must reflect the details of each piece so readers are transported to the scene through your writing.   To be an effective metro reporter you must be a local news junkie, so scouring the big dailies is a must for this class, hence the New York Times, New York Daily News and the New York Post are must-reads before class.

In this intensive skills course, you will zero in on a neighborhood/community in which New Yorkers determinedly straddle and embrace dual identities, bringing vibrancy and diversity to this city. You may cover your chosen beat through a variety of lenses, such as: \u2022 Zeroing in on individuals who have achieved success and others who struggle; \u2022 Profiling local institutions and businesses; \u2022 Examining a neighborhood's/community\u2019s historical and political underpinnings; \u2022 Focusing on a community's or individual\u2019s cultural/professional contributions.   Your beat may be a community defined by its residents' lands of origin (the Russians of Brighton Beach, Koreans of \"Koreatown\" [Manhattan], Albanians of Arthur Avenue], Indians of \"Curry Row\" [Manhattan], Irish of Woodlawn [Queens]), or by their race, religion, ethnicity or identity (Harlem USA, Chassidic Crown Heights, Downtown LGBT). Whether your story is about a place or an individual, an organization or an event, your writing must always capture the human side of the news- the heart of feature journalism. You will be guided in coming up with and pursuing great, fresh story ideas within your beat, in writing four graded pieces (three shorter ones and one more in-depth final), and in finding appropriate venues to pitch them. (Getting clips \u2013 not just grades - is one of the aims of this course.) The goal here is learning how to craft strong, captivating stories featuring memorable characters and settings - with much emphasis upon resourceful newsgathering and responsible presentation of facts and events, vivid color and detail, coherent and graceful structure, and impeccable mechanics (spelling, grammar, punctuation). A key focus of your reporting and writing will be to broaden your readers\u2019 perspective (and your own) on the cultural/ethnic/socioeconomic milieu of your subjects. This class will provide you with opportunities to write stories that are genuinely publishable, on subjects that genuinely interest you. You will be encouraged to write creatively and gorgeously, and even to try to change the world\u2026but your product must retain the clarity, concision and precision that were drummed into you in your basic reporting classes, stopping far short of \u201cfan-like,\u201d gushy prose, blinding passions, or fictional license.

In this course, students plot their own journey, inspired by classics old and new. We\u2019ll learn quest hallmarks like the role of obstacles, character, location, guides, gurus and skeptics, doubt and myth \u2013 and all-important narrative structure using present, past, future, suspense and flashback.   Students warm up for their 3,000-word magazine package in linked features that may include themes like The Place, The Guide, The Big Dare, Fish Out of Water, and In-The-Footsteps. Throughout, we\u2019ll work on balancing first with third person, detailed reporting with personal experience -- all while finding your authentic voice. Past student seekers have learned to motorcycle, studied stand-up comedy, overcome an addiction, lived with the homeless and hunted literary and historic myths from J.D. Salinger\u2019s New York to hidden Grand Central Station. What\u2019s your Holy Grail? In this class, you may find it. THE QUEST SPIRIT: This semester, we will pursue group and individual odysseys. It is crucial that everyone participate in both. In that spirit, you will be asked to set your personal goals for the semester in writing. You will also be asked to actively contribute and shape how we move forward as a group.

Home is a rich journalistic topic because it sits at the convergence of so many important things -- shelter, aspiration, self-expression, family, love, hate, childhood, adulthood. Home is where the hearth is, but also where the heart is.   In this course, a student might write about a lighthouse keeper and his life of solitude, nuns in a convent in the Bronx, a family that lives on a bobbing houseboat by the Hudson River piers, or a young couple who work as live-in caretakers at the Edgar Allen Poe House. Homes and their inhabitants are infinitely varied. There are nursing homes, squats, and artist communes; there are immigrants whose homes are statements of their foreign cultures and values; there are nannies whose homes are in fact other people\u2019s homes.   Because our homes reveal our values, dreams and interests, an article about a person\u2019s home is also an article about that person. Imagine a young techno geek, gripped by his ambition to launch an Internet startup; his distracted, obsessed consciousness is perfectly reflected in his apartment strewn with software code and electronic devices and hardly a place to sit. Or imagine a group of nuns who decide to put a green roof on their convent to satisfy their ecological beliefs. Or imagine an artist who lives for her art, who has an all-white apartment -- and who is happy to explain what her vision of beauty is.   \u00a0   \u00a0   \u00a0             Permalink             [x] close.

We will read these articles and book excerpts carefully - \"deep reading,\" it is called - to discover how good writers take basic journalism and enliven it with literary technique. We want to catalog as much of that technique and structure as we can so that we can \"steal it,\" appropriate the devices for our own work. Students will work in teams; each week a team will \"present\" the readings and incite a discussion with the rest of the class. There will be some three to five formal academic papers in which students will be asked to demonstrate their understanding of the material, and there will be a number of \"creative\" assignments as well.

This class will begin by tracing the development of traditional environmental journalism from John Muir to John McPhee and will then look closely at how the field is adapting to a fast-changing media landscape.

The panel, commonly referred to as the Kerner Commission, concluded that we are living in two nations, \u201cblack, white, separate and unequal,\u201d and devoted an entire chapter to the impact the media had on the nation\u2019s race relations. \u201cWe believe that the media have thus far failed to report adequately on the causes and consequences of civil disorders and the underlying problems of race relations,\u201d the report said. It added: \u201cThe media report and write from the standpoint of a white man\u2019s world. The ills of the ghetto, the difficulties of life there, the Negro\u2019s burning sense of grievance, are seldom conveyed.\u201d The report criticized as \u201cshockingly backward\u201d the industry\u2019s failure to hire, train and promote African Americans. At the time, fewer than five percent of the newsroom jobs in the United States were held by African Americans. Today, despite the progress that\u2019s been made in the hiring and coverage of African Americans and other so-called minorities, many critics say that the Kerner Report findings continue to resonate today. With the report as a backdrop, we will examine the portrayals of racial and ethnic minorities in the media, paying particular attention to African Americans \u2013 the subject of the Kerner Report \u2013 but also others, including Latinos, Asians, women, and gays and lesbians.

What does our culture\u2019s \u201cmedia\u201d tell us about its ideas of gender? What, if anything, does our gender tell us about our readings of \u201cmedia\u201d? Student participation in this seminar is key: students are expected to attend all sessions, to complete all the reading (there's lots of reading!), to participate actively in discussion, and to lead one of the class sessions themselves. Leading a class means opening the day\u2019s conversation with a presentation, critiquing and elaborating on the assigned reading, bringing in additional relevant material, and suggesting questions or issues that seem particularly interesting or troublesome. The purpose of the course is to develop our critical and self-critical faculties as journalists, media critics, consumers of media, and women or men\u2014to think clearly, challenge our pet assumptions, and have fun. Along with attendance and informed class participation, students are required to conduct a miniresearch project and present their findings to the class. I want you to pick a \u201cwomen and media\u201d topic that really interests you and then report the hell out of it. If you\u2019re interested in the effect of music videos on teenage girls, for instance, you would first put together an extensive bibliography of what has already been written on the subject. You would figure out what the key questions in the field were: do media images affect teens\u2019 behavior or not, and how can anyone tell? You might interview some of the leading researchers in the area and tell us what they say. You\u2019ll certainly want to read the most important books/articles on your subject. A paper is not required; instead, students will present their findings to the class during our last three sessions.

There are countries that are emerging economic powers and heading towards industrialization. In other cases, some countries are taking the lead in developing technology hubs, and testing out new forms of mobile banking and virtual money. Other countries wield considerable \u201csoft power\u201d via their film, music and contemporary culture and they are driving the way Africans present themselves to the world. Comprehensive coverage of Africa is scant. The sparse coverage is often a variation of an incomplete portrait that has dominated the Western media for the last 50 years: tales of starvation, political instability and disease are mainstays. There is often little or no historical or political context in most of this coverage. This course will provide students with an understanding of contemporary issues around the various regions on the African continent. We will examine the role of religion, including religious extremism that has led to the near- splintering of several societies; the struggles to develop viable democratic models; cultural norms and practices; and issues of economic development and empowerment. We will focus on the challenges of telling stories from Sub-Saharan Africa that are not the same old stories, with the same tired clich\u00e9s. We will accomplish this by reading works that combine history, political analysis and narrative journalism. This historical and political background will help students to eventually write about the region with depth and nuance, and to evaluate the coverage that they read. In addition, we will analyze the evolution and implications of the myriad of U.S. foreign policy actions on the African continent. Today, Africa is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. The continent\u2019s population is expected to double by 2050 and its influence on the world stage is growing. We will discuss the challenges of reporting from regions with competing narratives, authoritarian regimes that have little respect for a free press, and places where journalists must work under constant danger. We also will strive to on occasion have guest speakers who have worked as foreign correspondents or editors managing coverage of Africa. By the end of this course, you will hopefully be a more informed reader and analyst of events in the continent.             Permalink             [x] close.

Now, no talking for the first ten minutes of class. It sounds stupid, but it is our first exercise.   Good writing is all about finding the right detail or set of details that will show, not tell, the event to the listener. You are always fighting gravity, always fighting the reader who will close the paper, book, magazine and tune you out. We will focus on placing you in the right mental place to find the details that will tell the story, from your perspective, in a way that is honest to your truth and hold the reader.

This course will provide an introduction to the basic principles of research, reporting and writing the news. You will be introduced to a variety of ways in which we work in this fast paced, deadline driven business - from writing in the traditional newspaper pyramid style to opinion and feature writing to working for broadcast, and new media. You will do lots of writing because the only way to work on your skills is to practice it over and over.   To be a good reporter you have to be informed about what's happening in the world around you. For this class, you have to read The New York Times, New York Daily News and The New York Post every day. You must watch at least 15 minutes of television news or listen to news radio a day. You must also scan the free papers. (Metro &amp; AM NEW YORK) Once a week you will have a brief news quiz on the big stories of the week and your score will count toward your final grade.   In each class one or two students will take turns leading \"Newscheck,\" which is a discussion on a story of their choosing from the front pages of The New York Times. Everyone must participate in the discussion. Working journalists will visit throughout the semester. You will be expected to ask well thought out questions and take notes because you will have to write a 600-word story on each newsroom visitor. These stories will be due the day after they are assigned.   We will start out with obits and profiles where you will learn the nuances of storytelling and build up to writing a 1,000-word final news story on an issue of your choosing. This story should be good enough to be published. You will cover news events. We will get into this city's diverse colorful neighborhoods and find stories and spend lots of time exploring and hunting down news in New York City.   If a big story breaks, prepare to cover it. On any given day in the newsroom you have no idea what is going to happen. Be flexible! I can guarantee you that things will change as we go through our semester.

You will learn to research report and write authoritatively on New York City and all its problems and issues.   This is not a lecture class per se, so you will be out covering stories all over the Big Apple and then bringing them back to write on deadline. I will stress the news feature which will require a good amount of reporting before a piece is turned in but don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to go cover something on our beat on deadline.   You will sharpen your interviewing techniques and learn to follow up breaking news with insightful analytical pieces to go to the heart of the issue.\u00a0 You will develop a keen eye for detail and your copy must reflect the details of each piece so readers are transported to the scene through your writing.   To be an effective metro reporter you must be a local news junkie, so scouring the big dailies is a must for this class, hence the New York Times, New York Daily News and the New York Post are must-reads before class.

This course will look at early critiques of media to the present and will incorporate critical analysis form a variety of perspectives from critical discourse to ideological criticism to market and public journalism based models.

The goal is to figure out how memorable magazine features and narrative non-fiction books that keep your attention to the very last page are created, then to take what we've learned and apply it to our own work. There is one semester-long writing assignment\u2014a 3,000+-word feature story\u2014with several shorter related pieces involving scenes, character, dialogue, or analysis, all of which can be incorporated into your final story. Along the way we'll work on pitches, research and interview techniques, time management, outlines, editing and multiple drafts, and other challenges today's non-fiction narrative writers face.

This does not mean that students will be taught \"theories\" of cultural writing, which they can then apply to their \"practice.\" Rather, the point is that your thought process-as you write a piece, as you prepare to write it, or even before that, as you go through your daily life in a world full of potential subject matter-is an integral part of your work as a writer. We all carry on some kind of conversation with ourselves, and with the people we know, about the culture we live in. As writers, however, our task is to self-consciously translate that private conversation into a public one that connects with readers. In this course I ask you to address two questions that bear on this translation. One is historical: what has been said in the cultural conversation before you came to it? To find your place in the conversation (just as you would have to do if you joined a roomful of people talking) you will need to grapple with cultural issues and debates that go back half a century-debates about the nature of art and criticism, technology and mass media, high culture versus mass culture, art and politics, social groups and cultural difference. The second question is personal: what experiences, ideas, emotions, and prejudices do you bring to the conversation? While conventional news writers are simply expected to put their own attitudes aside, cultural journalists must be conscious of their standpoint and its impact on their observation and judgment. Your credibility and the power of your literary voice depend a good deal on your ability to develop this capacity for self-reflection. Open to CRC students only.

Our goal is to introduce ourselves to some of the best cultural critics (mainly of the 20th century); chart the ways in which the nature of 20th-century criticism \u2014 and art \u2014 have changed; investigate some of the major questions that preoccupy contemporary critics (especially the nature of modernism/postmodernism, high and low culture, irony and sincerity, and the culture wars); and begin to master some forms of critical writing. The paradox of how to develop a critical voice without writing directly about oneself will be explored. Among the critics we'll study are James Agee, Pauline Kael, John Berger, George Orwell, Gilbert Seldes, Susan Sontag, Lionel Trilling, Greil Marcus, Albert Murray, Norman Mailer and Wendy Steiner.

You spent a good deal of time on the basics \u2013 on research methods, sourcing, interview technique, note-taking, story organization, grammar, style and deadlines, tapping the resources of this great city all the while. The downbeat was accurate and evocative reporting, solid research and reporting and lively, well-organized stories. Ethics, cultural awareness, news judgment, analytical skills development and other reporting considerations especially important in the global sphere figured heavily, as did your introduction to multimedia skills.\u00a0In WRR II, we\u2019ll have two alternating drumbeats meant to deepen, amplify, and enhance the skills you will need as working professionals. More work on all of the above plus a new heavy emphasis on voice and originality, analysis, descriptive acuity, long-form structure and exquisite narrative technique in both short turnaround and longer deadline assignments.   We will work in a three-week rhythm: Story assignment workshops and exercises one week; Thesis workshops the next; and Multimedia every third week.\u00a0We will work in themes rather than ethnic neighborhoods as past WRR II classes have done. This is our conceit: We are correspondents based in New York City who cover the city not for the city, but for other locales. That could mean as a national reporter or as a reporter for a publication in another country. It\u2019s the most basic notion of foreign corresponding: making the place you are reporting from come alive in a truthful, factual, engaging way to those who cannot be there or do not know it.\u00a0   \u00a0   Open to GloJo students only.

Through careful reading and exercises, we will attempt to discover how fine non-fiction books are made. We will read five book-length narratives (among them Praying for Sheetrock by Melissa Faye Greene, and The Duke of Deception by Geoff Wolf) then take those books apart, chapter by chapter, to discover what material the writer collected, how and why the writer organized that material and, finally, what structure the writer used to create a compelling narrative that attempts to hold the reader from first page to last. Seminar members, working in teams with protocols supplied by the instructor, will \"present\" the books for analysis and lead a discussion of them.

The course is broken into three elements: (1) hands-on non-linear editing - students are given the raw elements from a story previously broadcast on CBS News (the Diet Project) and edit their version of the project in a simulated broadcast environment. (2) dissecting video story telling styles in the news magazine and long-form genre. (3) Integrating these learned editing techniques to the students\u2019 documentary work. There is class time dedicated to one-on-one editing sessions. Students may work with AVID, Final Cut Pro 7 or both to do their editing. It is important to understand that this course is not a \u201chow-to-use editing software\u201d. For what it\u2019s worth, Professor Spungen is fluent in editing with AVID software and is happy to answer any AVID related questions. His knowledge of FCP7 is not as strong, however all attempts will be made to help students with FCP7 questions.             Permalink             [x] close.

One is to finish your long piece. The other is to produce a short piece for our Election Special. You will work in groups of 2 for the election stories and then report live from various locations on election night as a follow-up to your reports. We will discuss this in class tonight and you will pitch stories on 9/21. This is very much a workshop class. You will present your work during the various stages of production\u2014developing your story, reviewing your raw tapes, scripts and rough-cuts during class. Each of you will develop a schedule with deadlines for both stories and submit this by 9/28. During class, I will also bring in tapes to discuss that will stimulate discussion of form and content. Classes may run past 8:00 PM as we get more involved in story development so please don't schedule yourself too tightly on Wednesdays. Before you edit your election pieces, I will conduct an AVID session to give you some shortcuts. If you want to work on FCP, you have access to the 504 A computers, but you will compete with all the other students for time on those machines. Our final class is Dec 14. From past experience, that is not enough time to view all projects so I suggest we also meet on the 15th. We can meet in the afternoon as well since formal classes are over on the 14th. If you need the time, we could also have our last meeting on 12/19. Please do not schedule airline tickets before then. We will also pick a date in early February for your film festival screening. We normally have it on a Saturday, be we could try for a Friday. Please choose from Jan 28 or Feb 4. Parents and friends, of course, are invited.

Unlike other professionals, journalists must make their ethical decisions rapidly, often without clear guidelines, and on their own, and the results of their decisions are open to public view. Also unlike other professionals, violations of ethical precepts are not punished by professional discipline or revocation of a license. This makes it vital that journalists weigh the value of how and what they choose to report against the potential harm to subjects, sources and society as a whole. The objective of this course is to provide guidance, through consideration of hypothetical and actual situations and analysis of case decisions, in developing a framework to help you make ethical and legal professional choices and to suggest some criteria against which those decisions may be measured.

Readings and discussion will focus on making sense of the large shifts that accompany the move to digital production and distribution in professional journalism, including the \"always on\" web, the lower barriers to entry, the rise of social media and \"the people formerly known as the audience,\" the ease of production using digital tools, the \"unbundling\" of news packages that were well adapted to prior platforms, the loss of monopoly status among news organizations, and the re-voicing of journalism in a more interactive environment for news. By comparing press ethics under the \"old\" system and the new codes that have emerged in the digital era, students will be able to hone in on what is different for professional journalists today, which is knowledge they will need for the remainder of the Studio 20 program.

We will deliberately attempt the transformation of memoir and memory into personal essay, and of reported experience into personal essay. Our theme will be the use of the personal essay format, and the incorporation of the personal narrative voice, in strongly written pieces which address a wide variety of issues, at home (literally) and out in the great wide world.

We will explore how to take advantage of the two main sources of information documents and people and discuss when and how to use computer data to both enhance a story or provide the foundation for a major project. Throughout the course, the goal will be to constantly delve beneath the surface. Going deep is the essence of investigative reporting, which pulls together all publicly available information, as well as harder-to-find material, to present the fullest possible picture. Corporations and powerful individuals employ armies of PR experts, lawyers and lobbyists to ensure that only their version of reality prevails, and it is the lonely duty of journalists to dispel this fog of self-interest. At least as important as mastering the technical skills will be learning to think critically and skeptically. The relentlessly upbeat press release, the carefully worded SEC filing or the late-Friday-afternoon earnings statement each, as a matter of course, should be probed for accuracy and omission.

Her book on women in the middle east is coming out in the fall.\u00a0   Over the last five years, newspapers and magazines based in the United States have closed dozens of foreign bureaus; today, only a handful of publications maintain any kind of full-time overseas presence. Meanwhile, dwindling reporting budgets mean that U.S.-based writers seeking foreign assignments have an increasingly hard case to make. While all this is bad news for readers, it represents a tremendous opportunity for journalists with the energy and flexibility to strike out on their own abroad. \"This course is intended for American students who are considering a stint reporting from overseas, as well as for students of other nationalities who would like to establish themselves writing for American outlets when they return home. We\u2019ll examine the kinds of story ideas that, when you\u2019re starting out, are most likely to set you apart from the competition and interest editors who aren\u2019t yet familiar with your writing. We\u2019ll address the tricky business of securing a stream of short-term, bread-and-butter assignments while also pursuing the kinds of complex stories that may require months or even years to report. We\u2019ll discuss practical concerns, such as how to work most effectively with translators and fixers, and how to form and maintain good relationships with editors many time zones away. We\u2019ll also survey the growing group of organizations that fund reporting projects overseas through fellowships and travel grants. Perhaps most important, we\u2019ll read some of the most exciting new writing from overseas, all of it by journalists who got their start freelancing abroad. We\u2019ll consider the work of now-established writers such as Wendell Steavenson, Peter Hessler, and Eliza Griswold, as well as writing by younger reporters, including Laura Kasinof, Joshua Hersh, and Alexis Okeowo. Many of these journalists have lived much closer to their subjects than American reporters overseas traditionally have, and we\u2019ll look at how that increased intimacy has benefited their work, as well as the difficulties and ethical questions it may have raised. Through our readings, we\u2019ll also examine the challenges of observing social change in an unfamiliar context, and of reporting on beliefs that we may find troubling or even abhorrent. Diminished budgets for overseas reporting, and the near-extinction of staff foreign correspondents, are among the most widely lamented aspects of the crisis in journalism.

Students will select a topic and will spend the semester researching it. Once the research is underway, we will practice incorporating it into literary nonfiction, a technique that can help transform prose from mundane to masterful. The final project will be a long reported piece. We will also read writers who use research in creative and invigorating ways. Expect to become a search ninja and learn to talk to experts like oral historians, archivists, or museum curators about how to mine the past for ideas.

They will also learn how to use data to perform investigative journalism. Outstanding examples of data journalism from around the world will be studied -- and the techniques those pieces used will be added to students' arsenals. A final project will test students\u2019 skills in using data to produce publishable-quality journalism.\u00a0\u00a0                                               Arthur L.

Curriculum and Speakers   SHERP 's customized curriculum is centered on case studies and real-world reporting assignments , as well as conversations with dozens of prominent guest speakers every semester from the worlds of journalism and science. Some visitors appear as part of SHERP 's \"Inside Out\" evening discussion series (we've posted videos of many of these), while many others speak during classes. SHERP alumni and emeriti faculty are frequent guests. We also host special events such as a forum on whether and how reporters should cover so-called \"intelligent design\" and a symposium on the scientific and journalistic challenges posed by the rise of synthetic biology research.   SHERP organizes seminar field trips every year to Brookhaven National Laboratory, The New York Times , The American Museum of Natural History and CNN. Many SHERP students also attend the annual conferences of the National Association of Science Writers, the Society of Environmental Journalists, the Association of Health Care Journalists or the American Association for the Advancement of Science. ( SHERP's faculty includes current or former leaders of all three journalism groups.) There are also fellowship opportunities for students to attend other conferences, including the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative and the Society for Neuroscience.   The program's award-winning student-run webzine, Scienceline , is fully integrated into coursework. SHERP students assign, report and edit stories , blogs , videos , audio podcasts and data visualizations , some of which begin as class assignments.   Multimedia training, including video production in Final Cut Pro, audio podcasting and data graphic design, begins in the first semester and continues throughout the first year of instruction.   The SHERP sequence consists of 12 classes (including one elective) over 16 months, for a total of 44 credits.   Curriculum quick links: first semester , second semester , summer semester , third semester , recent guest speakers , current faculty and past faculty .   \u00a0 First Semester (Fall) Classes   Writing and Reporting Workshop I (Prof. Michael Balter , syllabus , four credits) introduces students to the tools of the trade, while helping them report, write and, most importantly, think like journalists. Students learn the ingredients of a great news story, along with basic reporting techniques such as how to find story leads, track down information sources, and nail an interview. They also learn the principles of how to write with clarity, accuracy and style, and how to make the most of the editing process. In this class, SHERP students are also introduced to the burgeoning world of digital journalism, including blogging, video production and interactivity. They put their new skills into practice with varied assignments, with the aim of publishing their best work in Scienceline .   Current Topics in Science, Health and Environmental Journalism (Prof. Dan Fagin , syllabus , six credits) introduces students to the world of science journalism by looking at scientific topics that are at the cutting-edge of research and have profound implications for the way we live. In other words, they are the raw material for great journalism. As students immerse themselves in some challenging areas of current science, they read the work of highly accomplished researchers and journalists and also hear from them directly in class. The goal throughout is to understand and adopt the practices that the best science journalists use when they cover controversial science. Students learn how journalists interact with scientists, conduct research, organize information and write stories. Just as importantly, students sharpen their analytical skills by writing almost every week for Scienceline . Covering an assigned beat, students follow the peer-reviewed journals and other sources to stay on top of the news as it happens.   Investigative Science Journalism (Prof. Charles Seife , four credits) gives students the tools they will need to see through lies and shed light on facts that certain   people would   rather keep hidden. By the end of the semester, they will be able to   sniff out deception   and find the facts to uncover it; they\u2019ll also be relentless -- unwilling to let go once they seek their teeth into a juicy story. SHERP students will get the mathematical knowledge,   investigative reporting   techniques, and computer skills that will help them cut through   hype and   obfuscation, and it will do so by having them perform   first-rate   investigations on important scientific or medical topics. After   completing this   course, students will be formidable -- and dangerous --   reporters.   \u00a0 Second Semester (Spring) Classes   Writing and Reporting Workshop II (Prof. Stephen S. Hall , syllabus , four credits) is an introduction to long-form science journalism. Drawing on the narrative techniques of great fiction, students produce news features, books (proposals and outlines), reported essays, stand-alone videos and explanatory pieces. In addition to these major assignments, there are extensive in-class writing and reading exercises, including character sketches, op-eds and close textual analysis. Most classes also reserve time for an informal \"story meeting,\" where students will pitch story ideas. This culminates with a formal query letter pitched to a specific media outlet.   Environmental Reporting (Prof. Dan Fagin , syllabus , four credits) has three major components. Students focus on writing -- and rewriting! -- insightful stories about environment-related topics that are often emotionally charged and highly politicized. They also take deep dives into a series of crucial but often misunderstood topics such as risk assessment, epidemiology, environmental law, climate science, framing and the use of databases and other investigative tools. And finally, they read and discuss the work of exemplary environmental writers and thinkers, from Henry David Thoreau and Aldo Leopold to John McPhee and Bill McKibben. As they explore each of these three components, students practice many forms environmental journalism, including news stories, features, topical profiles, blog posts, persuasive columns and descriptive essays. They also critique newly published environmental journalism every week.   Data Journalism (elective) \u00a0(Profs.\u00a0 Kevin Quealy \u00a0and\u00a0 Amanda Cox ,\u00a0 syllabus , four credits) teaches the skills and techniques necessary for using statistical information effectively in science journalism. Obtaining, interpreting, visualizing and displaying data are essential skills for journalists in the 21st Century, especially those who cover scientific and technical subjects. Students will scrutinize techniques used in previously published projects and will also analyze data on their own, evaluating and producing tables, charts and diagrams using a variety of basic desktop software, web tools and basic scripting and programming.   Alternative electives \u00a0(four credits each) are opportunities for SHERP students to explore areas of special interest by taking a course offered elsewhere in the Carter Institute (or, by special permission, elsewhere in the university). Possibilities at the institute include graduate courses in advanced television and radio production, investigative reporting, entrepreneurial journalism, business journalism, essay writing, journalism and epidemics, criticism, ethnography and journalism, history of media, literary journalism, cultural reporting,hyperlocal coverage and food journalism, among others.   \u00a0 Summer Session Classes   Journalistic Judgment (Prof. Robin Henig , syllabus , four credits) is SHERP 's press ethics class. It emphasizes the special dilemmas and unique ethical decisions that come with covering science, health and environmental news. The First Amendment, libel, censorship (including self-censorship), transparency and ethical decision-making are key topics in this class.   Entrepreneurial Science Journalism (Prof. Christie Nicholson, four credits), is a project-based course to introduce students to business skills that will help them thirve as science journalism reinvents itself for digital platforms. Through research, interviews and exercises, students gain a foundational knowledge of how to build and defend a business concept. Some students work closely with well-established legacy brands in science journalism to develop new products or services that enhance those brands. Other students conceive and plan their own original startup businesses. The final deliverable is a thoroughly researched and polished pitch deck that is presented to a team of judges, along with accompanying documentation.   Fieldwork in Journalism (Prof. Apoorva Mandavilli , one credit) is the first of two required internships . (A few students also intern in the spring.) Preparatory work for the internships actually begins during the first semester of SHERP, when the program's internship coordinators work with students to prepare resumes and cover letters and assist them in identifying opportunities that fit their interests and aspirations. A Meet the Editors and Producers event, typically attended by more than 30 supervising editors who work with SHERP, is part of this process.\u00a0   \u00a0 Third Semester (Fall) Classes   Medical Reporting (Prof. Ivan Oransky, M.D. , syllabus , four credits) provides an in-depth look at many of the most important contemporary topics in the always dynamic field of medical journalism, including the biology of cancer, environment-related illness, epidemiology, and the precepts of sound medical research and peer review. Students write several short pieces on journal reports, medical conferences and community health lectures, and one longer, feature-length piece on a health topic of their choice. Medical researchers and prominent journalists are frequent guest speakers.   Science Writing (Prof. John Rennie , syllabus , four credits) is an advanced class that draws on all the skills students have practiced and polished during the previous year. The goal is to give a realistic preview of life as a working science journalist, from finding a story idea to pitching it to surviving the editing process to making sure the final product is accurate, clear and compelling. The class looks at science journalism from the editor's point of view, and also emphasizes the process of popularizing complex scientific and technical information for the mass media. Students produce at least one feature-length story, as well as several shorter pieces. The goal, as ever, is for students to write stories they can pitch to professional publications.   Fieldwork in Journalism (Prof. Apoorva Mandavilli , one credit) is the second of two required internships . During this final semester, the focus is on transitioning from internships to full-time work on staff or as a freelancer. Every year, several SHERP students land full-time jobs at places where they have interned.   \u00a0 A Partial List of Guest Speakers Since 2011:   Simon Anthony, post-doctoral fellow in virology, Columbia University   John Ascher, research entomologist, American Museum of Natural History   Kaitlin Bell Barnett, author   Sharon Begley, science writer, Thomson-Reuters   Charles Bergquist, producer, NPR Science Friday (SERP 15)   Burkhard Bilger, staff writer, The New Yorker   Deborah Blum, author and professor of journalism, University of Wisconsin   Jennifer Bogo, senior editor for science, Popular Mechanics   Seth Borenstein, science writer, The Associated Press   Alan Brown, associate professor of clinical psychiatry and epidemiology, Columbia University   Shannon Brownlee, author and freelancer   Benedict Carey, neuroscience writer, The New York Times   Stephen Cass, technology writer and editor   Ken Chang, science writer, The New York Times   Charles Choi, science writer.
