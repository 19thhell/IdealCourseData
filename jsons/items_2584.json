All attendees read key Supreme Court opinions and transcripts prior to the seminar. It\u2019s a great opportunity to kick back, have a drink, and talk SCOTUS with amazing NYU professors, judges, and practitioners.   All events are open only to currently enrolled JD/LLM students; two weeks before an event, we send out a link to an attendee lottery system.
