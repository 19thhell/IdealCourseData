Special Announcement: Friday April 27        The Swortzell Scholarship Graduate Fund - for 2007-2008 incoming   doctoral student.  Recipient announced at the Alumni Event on Friday April 27, 2007      Performance: Friday April 27       The Scarlet Letter      Stage Adaptation by Carol Gilligan      Hawthorne's brilliant insight -- he is writing now in 1850, at the time of Brook Farm and the Abolitionist Feminists -- was that the      very qualities that render a woman able to see the iron framework of society also disable her as an adulterated woman. He captures it      all in the letter A, which, as the story explains, means Able as well as Adultery. The central theme in my book, The Birth of Pleasure,      is the tension between love and patriarchy. This is also the theme of The Scarlet Letter . ---Carol Gilligan        Performance: Saturday April 28       Macbeth      The New Victory Theatre - New York's first theater for kids and families presents Macbeth . The acclaimed Chicago Shakespeare      Theater (CST) joins forces with Milan&rsquo;s 250-year-old Colla Marionette Company to present an evocative and visually stunning Macbeth .

Special Announcement: Friday April 27        The Swortzell Scholarship Graduate Fund - for 2007-2008 incoming   doctoral student.  Recipient announced at the Alumni Event on Friday April 27, 2007      Performance: Friday April 27       The Scarlet Letter      Stage Adaptation by Carol Gilligan      Hawthorne's brilliant insight -- he is writing now in 1850, at the time of Brook Farm and the Abolitionist Feminists -- was that the      very qualities that render a woman able to see the iron framework of society also disable her as an adulterated woman. He captures it      all in the letter A, which, as the story explains, means Able as well as Adultery. The central theme in my book, The Birth of Pleasure,      is the tension between love and patriarchy. This is also the theme of The Scarlet Letter . ---Carol Gilligan        Performance: Saturday April 28       Macbeth      The New Victory Theatre - New York's first theater for kids and families presents Macbeth . The acclaimed Chicago Shakespeare      Theater (CST) joins forces with Milan&rsquo;s 250-year-old Colla Marionette Company to present an evocative and visually stunning Macbeth .
