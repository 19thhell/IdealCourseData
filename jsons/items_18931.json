This course offers a broad survey of American cinema from its beginnings (and even its history) up to 1960. While the emphasis will be on the dominant, narrative fiction film, there will be attention to other modes of American cinema such as experimental film, animation, shorts, and non-fiction film. The course will look closely at films themselves -- how do their styles and narrative structures change over time? -- but also at contexts: how do films reflect their times? how does the film industry develop? what are the key institutions that had impact on American film over its history? We will also attend to the role of key figures in film's history: from creative personnel (for example, the director or the screenwriter) to industrialists and administrators, to censors to critics and to audiences themselves. The goal will be to provide an overall understanding of one of the most consequential of modern popular art forms and of its particular contributions to the art and culture of our modernity.

Course Level: Intermediate No prerequisite    This course provides a broad overview of world cinema from its origins until the emergence of modern cinema in the 1960's. It addresses numerous national cinemas (French, German, Italian, Japanese, Scandinavian, Soviet, British, Indian) and examines both how representative films from each country emerges out of its national culture and also negotiates with the dominant aesthetic of Hollywood film. The approach will be stylistic, including the development of narrative, various cinematic modernisms, and technological advances such as the introduction of sound; industrial, including the formation of the studio system and the creation of national film cultures in response; and social, including propaganda and political (leftist) films and documentaries. Whenever possible, this course emphasizes the cross-pollination of film styles across national cultures such as the mutual influence of 1920's avant-garde movements, the concentration of political filmmaking in the 1930's, or the influence of neorealism on post-war cinema. Some films to be screened: Strike, L'age d'or, M, Housing Problems, Umberto D, Tokyo Story , and Pather Panchali.
