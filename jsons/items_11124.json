School-age child care services may be needed for before-school, after-school, and during holiday/vacation days, and summer vacation weeks.   There are several options one might consider when scheduling your child's out-of-school time including:     Hire your child's regular care provider for additional hours and days;   Talk with other parents about sharing care, trading play dates, etc.   Hire a responsible high school, college student, or adult to care for your child alone or with a friend or two;   Determine if your child's school offers an organized program;   Determine if your local library or museum offers a special program or activity.   Explore and enroll your child in a special holiday/vacation camp program .       NYC School-Age Child Care Licensing Regulations     In New York City school-age services are a licensed form of care.

In 1889, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration,     a wooden arch was built across lower Fifth Avenue about half a block north     of Washington Square. This temporary structure was constructed of plaster     of paris and wood, and lit by hundreds of light bulbs. The people of New     York liked it so much they commissioned architect Sanford White to build     a permanent marble monument, which was completed in 1895. For many, this     beautiful triumphant arch, is the single most important symbol of Greenwich     Village.       -The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation .

In fact, their needs are more varied and meeting those needs may take some creativity on your part. School-age child care services may be needed for before-school, after-school, and during holiday/vacation days, and summer vacation weeks.   There are several options one might consider when scheduling your child's out-of-school time including:     Hire your child's regular care provider for additional hours and days;   Talk with other parents about sharing care, trading play dates, etc.   Hire a responsible high school, college student, or adult to care for your child alone or with a friend or two;   Determine if your child's school offers an organized program;   Determine if your local library or museum offers a special program or activity.   Explore and enroll your child in a special holiday/vacation camp program .       NYC School-Age Child Care Licensing Regulations     In New York City school-age services are a licensed form of care.

In 1889, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration,     a wooden arch was built across lower Fifth Avenue about half a block north     of Washington Square. This temporary structure was constructed of plaster     of paris and wood, and lit by hundreds of light bulbs. The people of New     York liked it so much they commissioned architect Sanford White to build     a permanent marble monument, which was completed in 1895. For many, this     beautiful triumphant arch, is the single most important symbol of Greenwich     Village.       -The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation .
