While publicly traded companies must report financial information to government regulatory agencies (e.g., the SEC), private companies don't need to disclose much at all.   If you aren't sure about a company, try using the company search in LexisNexis . You'll see in the list of results whether a company is public or private.   If a company is private...     Use Hoovers and D&amp;B Million Dollar Database for basic information.   Search for articles about the company in LexisNexis , Factiva , Business Source Premier , and ABI/Inform .     If a company is public...     See the \"Financial Information\" box under Company &amp; Industry Research in this guide   Go straight to ThomsonResearch or EdgarScan for SEC filings                 Comments (0)                                         Tckr Symbls                   If you search for a company in LexisNexis or Factiva, make a note of the ticker symbol. This can help you in the future, when you want to be precise.       For example, searching for BGP will help you get to documents related to Borders the book store, rather than other companies with the word \"Borders\" in their names.

You have the option to search EDGAR via the SEC's website or via subscription library databases.   Hoover's will link out to SEC filings, where available. Searching within Thomson Research will also link you to independent analyst reports.           Comments (0)                                         SIC & NAICS                 Simply put, these are two industry classification systems and as you begin to navigate the business databases, you will see them everywhere.   SIC is an older, more international system, still in use by the U.S. Government.   NAICS is a little newer and generally applies to North America. Either way, don't fret too much about these. Just understand that they are used to code specific industries, largely for the purposes of research and statistics.   For a more complete explanation, see the section on classifications in this article from the International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences .
