Background and Technology Development   Fiber-optic sensors have become an important class of sensors for structural health monitoring in aerospace and automobile applications. Power modulation based sensors are of particular interest for such applications because of their simple construction and sensing principle. These sensors rely on optical intensity losses through curved waveguides. Bending an optical fiber beyond a critical radius results in optical power losses through the curved section due to coupling between guided and radiation modes. The higher order modes in a multimode optical fiber are coupled out of the fiber. This phenomenon in multimode fibers results in a linear relation between displacement and intensity change.   The NYU team has taken fiber-optic displacement technology a step further. Traditionally, fiber-optic sensors could measure substantial displacements would not have the sensitivity to accurately measure small displacements as well due to a smoothing over of the small intermediate peaks. The NYU sensor can measure both, however. The sensor is capable of measuring up to 5 mm displacement with resolution of 1 micron. This is presented in a simple design that is compact, cheap, and potentially easy to use. The sensor can be attached to the surface of the specimen or structure. It can also be embedded inside the structure because the sensor thickness is only about 250 microns. The sensor can also be used as a long probe for conducting measurements in a remote area.   Applications   In addition to the current applications in the aerospace and automotive industries, the affordable, compact nature of the NYU fiber-optic loop-sensor opens up other potential applications. The NYU team is currently looking into using the sensor to monitor aging civil infrastructure, buildings, and to measure extension in biomaterials during tensile testing.

Although details remain unknown, it is becoming clear that chromatin is polymorphic depending on internal and external factors. In particular, different lengths of the linker DNAs joining successive nucleosomes (measured in nucleosome-repeat lengths or NRLs) that characterize different cell types and cell cycle stages produce different structures. NRL is also nonuniform within single fibers, but how this diversity affects chromatin fiber structure is not clear. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of a coarse-grained oligonucleosome model to help interpret fiber structure subject to intrafiber NRL variations, as relevant to proliferating cells of interphase chromatin, fibers subject to remodeling factors, and regulatory DNA sequences. We find that intrafiber NRL variations have a profound impact on chromatin structure, with a wide range of different architectures emerging (highly bent narrow forms, canonical and irregular zigzag fibers, and polymorphic conformations), depending on the NRLs mixed. This stabilization of a wide range of fiber forms might allow NRL variations to regulate both fiber compaction and selective DNA exposure. The polymorphic forms spanning canonical to sharply bent structures, like hairpins and loops, arise from large NRL variations and are surprisingly more compact than uniform NRL structures. They are distinguished by tail-mediated far-nucleosome interactions, in addition to the near-nucleosome interactions of canonical 30-nm fibers. Polymorphism is consistent with chromatin\u2019s diverse biological functions and heterogeneous constituents. Intrafiber NRL variations, in particular, may contribute to fiber bending and looping and thus to distant communication in associated regulatory processes.
