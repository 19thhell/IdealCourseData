Alfano, DMD, PhD   Dean  New York University College of Dentistry   &quot;Ask    Your Dentist.&quot; As the cover photo suggests, this phrase is at the    heart of a strategy to shape positive change in dental health care.    New York University College of Dentistry (NYUCD) introduced the    phrase last spring as part of a three-day,    free oral cancer screening program, which launched IMPACT, the College's    Initiative to Mobilize Patient Advocacy, Concern, and Treatment.    The story of the inception, progress, and results of that program    (&quot;An Amazing Week in the Life of NYU College of Dentistry&quot;) is featured    in this issue.   The &quot;Ask Your    Dentist&quot; strategy seeks to enhance dentistry's relationship with    the public, thereby increasing the flow of patients into dental    offices, and to influence the way dentistry is practiced by educating    consumers to expect and demand specific health care procedures.    For example, the free screenings were aimed at educating consumers    about the deadliness of oral cancer and at motivating them to ask    their dentists how to avoid becoming an oral cancer statistic. The    phrase &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; appeared in all advertisements and proved    to be so powerful a call to action that NYUCD has adopted &quot;Ask Your    Dentist&quot; as the IMPACT theme. Such is the power of this theme that    many dentists in the New York-New Jersey region are now planning    to offer oral cancer screenings in their offices.      Next on the    IMPACT agenda is a campaign to obliterate tooth decay in children    by marketing to parents the concept that preventive dental techniques    are so good that they may never have to pay for another filling.    The campaign is based on an NYUCD program that promises parents    that if kids get cavities after enrolling in a regimen of preventive    treatment and good home care, NYUCD will restore the teeth free    of charge. All advertisements for the campaign will urge parents    to &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; how to prevent kids from getting cavities,    once and for all. An article in this issue by Dr. Linda R. Rosenberg    (&quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot;) describes the NYUCD program.      Going forward,    IMPACT will conduct an antismoking campaign targeting preteens,    a campaign to alert the public to the important links between oral    health and systemic disease, and a campaign to reduce premature    births associated with periodontal disease. All of these initiatives    will be built around the &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; theme.      Another strategy    designed to encourage dialogue between consumers and their dentists    will be unveiled this spring when NYUCD presents a free program    for the community -- a sort of mini-dental school -- from the consumer's    perspective. The program will feature an enlightening look at modern    dentistry through topics including the links between periodontal    disease and heart disease, how a &quot;smile lift&quot; can rejuvenate facial    appearance, and why certain foods taste the way they do.      &quot;Ask    Your Dentist&quot; - A Resource for the Profession   An added goal    of the &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; strategy is to enhance the relationship    between NYUCD and its alumni. Accordingly, we take the theme &quot;Ask    Your Dentist&quot; a step further in this issue by introducing two new    resources. One is an interactive approach to &quot;Ask Your Dentist,&quot;    which enables you to get answers to your questions regarding professional    ethics from Milton Palat, D.D.S., J.D. You will recall Dr. Palat    as a contributor to the inaugural issue of Global Health NEXUS,    in which he discussed the ethical impact on society of dentists    who fail to perform an oral cancer exam. Selected questions and    answers will appear in future issues of the magazine. The other    is a column entitled &quot;Practicing for Life,&quot;sm in which we ask different    alumni in each issue to share their views on fostering development    of those aspects of dentistry that impact general health. We are    delighted that Dr. Alan Queen, editor of the Bulletin of the    Queens County Dental Society and an NYUCD alumnus, has authored    our first &quot;Practicing for Life&quot;sm    column in this issue. These are just a few of the innovations that    you will find featured in this issue of Global Health NEXUS.          The mail we    received in response to our first issue was wonderful. Please continue    to send in your comments. We hope that you find this issue of Global    Health NEXUS one more way to connect with NYUCD.

The event included a time-capsule dedication,      special musical performance, and fireworks display. NYUCD's time-capsule      entry was a collection of models of state-of-the-art dental therapeutic      techniques and a letter from Dean Alfano containing his predictions      for dentistry in the new millennium. Other all-University millennium      events will include a winter gala, a series of lectures, and a Web      exhibit.       Millennium projects      underway at NYUCD include an all-College millennium party in December      and an oral history of the College from 1965 to the present, featuring      interviews with former deans, Dean Alfano, students, faculty, and      staff.

Alfano, DMD, PhD   Dean  New York University College of Dentistry   &quot;Ask    Your Dentist.&quot; As the cover photo suggests, this phrase is at the    heart of a strategy to shape positive change in dental health care.    New York University College of Dentistry (NYUCD) introduced the    phrase last spring as part of a three-day,    free oral cancer screening program, which launched IMPACT, the College's    Initiative to Mobilize Patient Advocacy, Concern, and Treatment.    The story of the inception, progress, and results of that program    (&quot;An Amazing Week in the Life of NYU College of Dentistry&quot;) is featured    in this issue.   The &quot;Ask Your    Dentist&quot; strategy seeks to enhance dentistry's relationship with    the public, thereby increasing the flow of patients into dental    offices, and to influence the way dentistry is practiced by educating    consumers to expect and demand specific health care procedures.    For example, the free screenings were aimed at educating consumers    about the deadliness of oral cancer and at motivating them to ask    their dentists how to avoid becoming an oral cancer statistic. The    phrase &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; appeared in all advertisements and proved    to be so powerful a call to action that NYUCD has adopted &quot;Ask Your    Dentist&quot; as the IMPACT theme. Such is the power of this theme that    many dentists in the New York-New Jersey region are now planning    to offer oral cancer screenings in their offices.      Next on the    IMPACT agenda is a campaign to obliterate tooth decay in children    by marketing to parents the concept that preventive dental techniques    are so good that they may never have to pay for another filling.    The campaign is based on an NYUCD program that promises parents    that if kids get cavities after enrolling in a regimen of preventive    treatment and good home care, NYUCD will restore the teeth free    of charge. All advertisements for the campaign will urge parents    to &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; how to prevent kids from getting cavities,    once and for all. An article in this issue by Dr. Linda R. Rosenberg    (&quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot;) describes the NYUCD program.      Going forward,    IMPACT will conduct an antismoking campaign targeting preteens,    a campaign to alert the public to the important links between oral    health and systemic disease, and a campaign to reduce premature    births associated with periodontal disease. All of these initiatives    will be built around the &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; theme.      Another strategy    designed to encourage dialogue between consumers and their dentists    will be unveiled this spring when NYUCD presents a free program    for the community -- a sort of mini-dental school -- from the consumer's    perspective. The program will feature an enlightening look at modern    dentistry through topics including the links between periodontal    disease and heart disease, how a &quot;smile lift&quot; can rejuvenate facial    appearance, and why certain foods taste the way they do.      &quot;Ask    Your Dentist&quot; - A Resource for the Profession   An added goal    of the &quot;Ask Your Dentist&quot; strategy is to enhance the relationship    between NYUCD and its alumni. Accordingly, we take the theme &quot;Ask    Your Dentist&quot; a step further in this issue by introducing two new    resources. One is an interactive approach to &quot;Ask Your Dentist,&quot;    which enables you to get answers to your questions regarding professional    ethics from Milton Palat, D.D.S., J.D. You will recall Dr. Palat    as a contributor to the inaugural issue of Global Health NEXUS,    in which he discussed the ethical impact on society of dentists    who fail to perform an oral cancer exam. Selected questions and    answers will appear in future issues of the magazine. The other    is a column entitled &quot;Practicing for Life,&quot;sm in which we ask different    alumni in each issue to share their views on fostering development    of those aspects of dentistry that impact general health. We are    delighted that Dr. Alan Queen, editor of the Bulletin of the    Queens County Dental Society and an NYUCD alumnus, has authored    our first &quot;Practicing for Life&quot;sm    column in this issue. These are just a few of the innovations that    you will find featured in this issue of Global Health NEXUS.          The mail we    received in response to our first issue was wonderful. Please continue    to send in your comments. We hope that you find this issue of Global    Health NEXUS one more way to connect with NYUCD.      Do you need    an answer to a question involving professional ehtics? You can &quot;Ask    Your Dentist&quot; by contacting NYUCD's ethicist, Dr.    Milton Palat .

The event included a time-capsule dedication,      special musical performance, and fireworks display. NYUCD's time-capsule      entry was a collection of models of state-of-the-art dental therapeutic      techniques and a letter from Dean Alfano containing his predictions      for dentistry in the new millennium. Other all-University millennium      events will include a winter gala, a series of lectures, and a Web      exhibit.       Millennium projects      underway at NYUCD include an all-College millennium party in December      and an oral history of the College from 1965 to the present, featuring      interviews with former deans, Dean Alfano, students, faculty, and      staff.

It would have been easy to rest there, but we\u2019re not known to stand still. The decade and a half since 2000 has brought a whirlwind of pursuit, achievement, and global emergence .                   Movement is indeed part of the university\u2019s DNA\u2014as is a healthy dose of grit. The combination inspired scholar David Kirp to declare: \u201cNYU is the success story in contemporary American higher education.\u201d And what does success look like? A few examples: Eight straight years of record-setting applications (60,322 for the Class of 2019, the most of any private university), research expenditures\u2014a measure of our faculty output\u2014that grew from $322 million to $467 million over the last five years, and the rise to #27 on the 2014 Academic Ranking of World Universities, up from #32 in 2008 and #55 in 2003.       But there\u2019s so much more to the story. Come along and dig a little deeper to see how NYU has become a pioneer in pursuing knowledge, fostering art of every kind, and solving the great research problems of our times.
