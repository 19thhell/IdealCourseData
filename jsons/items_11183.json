We use superior diagnostic technology and offer a variety of robot-assisted minimally invasive surgical procedures, including hysterectomy, prostatectomy, kidney surgery, lung surgery, urologic procedures, heart procedures, and colon surgery.   Our experts have pioneered numerous types of robotic surgery, and teach these techniques to physicians across the world. These procedures are performed with one of our five da Vinci Si Surgical Systems \u2014 the most sophisticated surgical device in existence. They have a dual console, so surgeons can operate together or be trained on a particular procedure. We are the first medical center in New York using the new da Vinci\u00ae Xi\u2122 Surgical System.
