ARISE Several Biology Department faculty and their lab members   serve as mentors in NYU Poly's ARISE (Applied Research Innovations in   Science and Engineering) program. ARISE provides a summer research   experience in various STEM fields for NYC high school students who   otherwise do not have access to a rigorous STEM education. The students   spend three weeks taking college-level coursework on scientific method   followed by four weeks of hands-on research in a lab, and finish the   program by presenting their work at a poster session. 2014 Program ARISE Information    Justin Blau has been organizing a 1 day visit to the Biology   Department each May to raise awareness of research as a career   possibility for students from the University of Houston- Downtown .   UHD is considered one of the most ethnically diverse liberal arts   institutions in the southwest. Students hear talks from faculty, tour   the labs, and discuss life in academia with current PhD students over   lunch.   Edo Kussell brings groups of middle school students from the Explore Charter School    in Flatbush, Brooklyn to visit NYU Biology twice per year. Students get   hands-on lab tours of three different labs and meet graduate students   in each lab. Topics are usually linked with their current school   curriculum.   The NYAS afterschool STEP program focuses on getting hands on experimental experience to children in under-served public schools. Andres Mansisdor (Andreas Hochwagen\u2019s lab) mentored a group of students at Tompkins Square Middle School.   Max Kramer and Alison Mello (Sevinc Ercan\u2019s lab) have worked with Citizen Schools    which provides extended day school programming to public school   children in low-income communities. They designed and taught a once a   week after school class at the Bronx Writing Academy middle school   titled \"Invisible World.\" Students explored the relationship between   microbes, organic molecules and food. The class culminated with a   project and presentation where the students used raw ingredients and   microbes to make foods like fermented ginger ale and yeast risen   doughnuts.
