John Singler             Adjunct Faculty             Zvjezdana Vrzic       For the last several years, I have been working on the Vlashki/Zheyanski language, the severely endangered Balkan Romance language spoken on the Istrian peninsula in Croatia. This work, funded in the US and in Croatia, aims for the creation of a large-scale annotated audio-video corpus of the language, and its analysis. In terms of analysis, I'm especially interested in contact-induced language change, both in its sociolinguistic and its grammatical, especially, syntactic aspects. Part of this work, included in the ongoing NSF-funded project Documentation of the Vlashki/Zheyanski Language, is done along with John V. Singler. I have also begun work on the documentation of another unique and endangered Romance language spoken on the Istrian peninsula, the Istriot language. In the summer of 2013, I organized and lead a summer school in language documentation for the Istriot community members. In my language documentation work, I strive to combine the interest of the discipline with the greater good of the community and aim for wide accessibility of project products (see, for example, the Vlashki/Zheyanski language website at www.vlaski-zejanski.com and education and participation of community members.             Students             Carina Bauman       My research focuses on language and identity. I'm currently working on a dissertation proposal that aims to look at language practices in an Asian American sorority. The central question I want to address is how sorority members use linguistic resources to construct a shared, (pan-)ethnic identity. I plan to use participant observation and sociolinguistic interviews to study both phonetic and discourse variables.             Isaac Bleaman       My interests lie primarily in variation analysis, language contact, and Yiddish. One long-term project I am designing will compare the varieties of American Yiddish used by relatively isolated non-Hasidic heritage speakers and by Hasidim, who still constitute a &quot;speech community&quot; in the traditional sense. My previous work has focused on vernacular style in Yiddish literature and its &quot;authenticity&quot; with respect to the speech patterns of real Yiddish speakers.             Marie-Eve Bouchard       I am especially interested Brazilian Portuguese and the world of Creole Language studies. Like many who study Creole Languages, I find the ingenuity and the richness within those languages quite revealing. I believe that an understanding of Creole Languages could transform our understanding of the language creation and language change under forced contact. Often seen as a threat, language contact is increasingly inevitable in the current context of globalization, opening of borders, and emigration. The study of what has happened in the relatively recent past can be used to predict what is likely to happen in the future. Also, the study of Creole Languages is, I believe, a key to eliminating prejudice against Creoles Languages and their speakers.

So far, I\u2019ve found the answer a complicated one, where the intersection of ethnicity, class, and age affects how closely a speaker adheres to NYCE. I am examining vowel quality in NYCE-specific features (the short-a split, raised and in-gliding /\u0254/, and nucleus-glide differentiation in /aI/ and /a\u028a/) in the English of Jersey City natives of varying ethnic and class backgrounds and ages.             Dan Duncan       Right now, I'm interested in language use in suburban areas and its relation to identity in those places, as well as dialect syntax, primarily in English, as a means of analyzing syntactic variation. \u00a0In previous research I've looked at language as performance in country music and language policy as structural violence.             Nicole Holliday       I am interested in how individuals with a motivation to simultaneously identify with multiple social groups use language to establish their identities. Specifically, I\u2019m focusing on how black/white American biracials combine Mainstream U.S. English (MUSE) and African American English (AAE) to construct a racial identity.

Zack Jaggers       I\u2019m interested in the variation of loanwords, especially toponyms, both at the phonological and sociolinguistic levels, as well as their interface. Specifically, I am interested in the 'unnativization' of loanwords (i.e. the pronunciation of a loanword more similarly to its source language form than the borrowing language's conventional adaptation). I feel it imperative to consider the social situation of a loanword's borrowing and usage and what social factors could affect instantaneous pronunciation and even what will become the conventional, established adaptation. Things I consider: \u00a0stage of dissemination (i.e. How long ago was this word borrowed?), frequency of usage in the borrowing language, context and style, the speaker's identity, and the speaker's alignment and stance regarding the source language and/or its associated culture. I would argue that any theoretical analysis of loanword adaptation cannot ignore these possible influences. I have mainly examined this in the methodologies of experimental phonology and perceptual evaluation and hope to approach this variationistically as well.             Nate LaFave       I have been working on experimental and corpus research investigating adjective gradation, the process that creates comparatives and superlatives.

The Sociolinguistics Laboratory \u00a0has been \u00a0active and productive in the field for the last two decades. The core faculty members include Renee Blake, Gregory Guy and John Singler. In addition, Rudi Gaudio, Louise Vasvari and Zvjezdana Vrzic have regularly taught in the department. The sociolinguistics community also has ties to the linguistics anthropology faculty including Bambi Schieffelin and Sonia Das in the Department of Anthropology at NYU. Additionally, our students work closely with the phonetics/phonology faculty including Lisa Davidson, Gillian Gallagher and Maria Gouskova. The City University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center is located in close proximity to NYU, which allows for regular interactions and meetings with its linguistics faculty, affiliates and students. The CUNY faculty include Cecilia Cutler, Bill Haddican, Michael Newman, Ricardo Otheguy and Arthur Spears.       Our faculty and students work on a wide range of topics regarding language variation and change. We conduct fieldwork locally in New York City communities and across the United States , as well as throughout the globe. Our work connects with many subdisciplines of linguistics including phonetics, phonology, syntax, and semantics. Our work is also strongly informed by anthropology. We collaborate with the Anthropology Department at NYU through the Working Group in Urban Sociolinguistics to sponsor talks and workshops by scholars in the field. Finally, the Linguistics Department at NYU has a visiting scholars program that has welcomes sociolinguists from around the world.                                      \u00a0             \u00a0"}, {"content": "People                                  \u00a0                                                                  \u00a0             \u00a0                     People                                                                                                                          \u00a0                     NYU Sociolinguistics Faculty       Renee Blake       Gregory Guy       John Singler              Adjunct Faculty       Zvjezdana Vrzic                                         Recent Sociolinguistics Ph.D. Alumni              2012             Danny\u00a0Erker        Assistant Professor       Spanish and Linguistics       Boston University       Email: danerker@bu.edu             2011             Sonya\u00a0Fix        Adjunct Faculty       Department of Liberal Arts       Columbus College of Art and Design       Email: sonya.fix@nyu.edu             Marcos\u00a0Rohena-Madrazo        Assistant Professor       Department of Spanish and Portuguese       Middlebury College       Email: mrm359@nyu.edu             2010             Maryam\u00a0Bakht        Adjunct Assistant Professor of Anthropology and English       Hunter College, CUNY       Email: maryam.bakht@gmail.com             Kara\u00a0Becker        Assistant Professor of Linguistics       Reed College       Email: kbecker@reed.edu             Laureen\u00a0Lim        Email: laure@projectpod.com             Simanique\u00a0Moody        Postdoctoral fellow       Linguistics Department       University of California, Santa Barbara       Email: poomoody@hotmail.com             Jennifer\u00a0Nycz        Assistant Professor       Department of Linguistics       Georgetown University       Email: jn621@georgetown.edu             2009             Chanti\u00a0Seymour        Assistant Professor of Linguistics and English       The College of The Bahamas (Nassau)       Email: kcs217@nyu.edu             Laurie\u00a0Woods        Email: lauriewoods@earthlink.net             2007             Komlan\u00a0Essizewa        Associate professor of sociolinguistics       Head of department       University of Lom\u00e9, Togo       Email: kee206@nyu.edu             Erez\u00a0Levon        Tenured Lecturer in Linguistics       School of Languages, Linguistics and Film       Queen Mary, University of London       Email: e.levon@qmul.ac.uk             2006             Philipp Sebastian Angermeyer        Associate Professor of Linguistics       York University, Canada       Email: psa208@nyu.edu             Ken\u00a0Lacy        Last academic position: Visiting Assistant Professor       College of William and Mary       Email: knl201@nyu.edu                                               Current NYU Sociolinguistics Graduate Students       Carina Bauman       Isaac Bleaman       Marie-Eve Bouchard       Libby Coggshall       Dan Duncan       Zack Jaggers       Nicole Holliday       Nate LaFave       Luiza Newlin-Lukowicz       Emily Nguyen       Natalie Povilonis de Vilchez       Allison Shapp       Cara Shousterman       Amy Wong                   \u00a0             \u00a0"}, {"content": "Current Work in the NYU Sociolinguistics Lab                                \u00a0                                                                  \u00a0             \u00a0                     Current Work in the NYU Sociolinguistics Lab                           \u00a0                     Here you\u2019ll find short descriptions of the work of the members of the Sociolab, written in their own words.

I continue to be interested in social distinctions based on place but plan to investigate the convergence of place and ethnicity with respect to features found in the Upper Midwest, Minnesota specifically, as well as ethnic communities in this area.\u00a0\u00a0             Alison Shapp             Cara Shousterman                   \u00a0             \u00a0"}]}]
