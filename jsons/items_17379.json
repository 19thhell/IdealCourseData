Focus includes characters, backgrounds, relationship and progression by performance, and the emotional and physical demands of character and improvisation. *Armando Diaz's Spring section This class uses the methods of \"Long-Form Improvisation\" to teach students an approach to directing and performing in comedy. As well, the class explores the and embraces the concept of \"truth in comedy\" as it pertains to the principles of Action, Objective and Justification.
