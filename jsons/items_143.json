A gateway to all majors offered by the  Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. Focuses on the core  concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA: Africana  Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American (A/P/A) Studies,  Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan  Studies. The course surveys basic approaches to a range of  significant analytical concepts (for example, property, work,  technology, nature, popular culture, consumption, and knowledge),  each one considered within a two-week unit.          Approaches to Africana Studies SCA-UA 101 Cultures and Contexts:  Africa (MAP-UA 505) or Cultures and Contexts: The African Diaspora  (MAP-UA 532) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (MAP-UA  534) can substitute for this course.

Internship Seminar SCA-UA 42 Corequisite: Internship  Fieldwork (SCA-UA 40). 2 points. The 4-point internship program  complements and enhances the formal course work of Africana studies  majors. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues  pertaining to Africana studies and take a corequisite seminar that  enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic  terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow  students to apply the theory that they have gained through course  work, (2) to provide students with analytical tools, and (3) to  assist students in their exploration of professional career paths.  The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an  interview and permission of the director of internships.      Independent Study        Independent Study SCA-UA 197, 198 Prerequisite:  permission of the program director. Offered every semester. 1 to 4  points per term.      Elective Courses          Black Urban Studies SCA-UA 115 Formerly SCA-UA 105.  Identical to HIST-UA 90. Offered every year. 4 points. Introduces students to the tools of  cultural criticism and theory, with particular emphasis on black  culture, urban environment, and black people\u2019s relationships to a  variety of social and cultural institutions and practices. The latter  may include the mass media, class and poverty, the police, urban  development, education, music, art, and sports.          African American 20th-Century Novels  and Narratives SCA-UA 139 Offered every year. 4  points. This seminar covers a historicized  selection of black writers who over the latter half of the 20th  century have inscribed in literature the cultural, social, and  political experiences of African Americans in the United States. We  critically explore, discuss, and write about a range of works varying  from poetry to the short story and the novel. Our studies focus on  the key topics, issues, innovations, and themes that have  consistently been important to African American literary production.  Some examples are the emancipation impulse, \u201cdouble consciousness,\u201d  the black struggle for human rights, the rise of black women writers,  postmodernism, sexual and gender politics, and contemporary  expressions of the slavery motif.          The Black Essay SCA-UA 152 Offered every year. 4  points. Examines the urban experience and black  life and culture in New York through a series of writing assignments  on African American neighborhoods, institutions, issues, and culture.  Students are required to travel throughout the black community,  conduct interviews, and do research for essays on the black  experience in the city. They are introduced to the research and  reporting techniques of journalism and given the chance to employ  these techniques in their papers.          The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 Offered every year. 4  points. This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in  addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Central  to our discussions is a focus on how the display of the black body  affects how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case  studies, we consider the construction of beauty, gendered images,  race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly  determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary  society. The interplay between the historical and the contemporary,  between self-presentation and imposed representation, is fundamental  to our discussions. The seminar centers the student within the  contemporary world of image making with an emphasis on the black  body. Final projects include an imaging project and/or a written  essay.          Black Feminism SCA-UA 156 Offered once every two  years. 4 points. This course explores the production and  practice of black feminist theory in 20th-century America. We examine  the written work and the activism of African American women and look  at the way that theory and practice historically intersect around  questions of race and gender. Because this is a course on feminism,  we also spend a good deal of time interrogating power and thinking  about the ways in which systems of oppression both produce and block  a black feminist consciousness. Hip Hop &amp; Politics SCA-UA 157 Offered every year. 4 points. In places ranging from the political theory of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby we find a critique of the \"hip hop generation\" so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. Besides realizing the worst fears of a previous generation who placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, this new generation's fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \"hip-hop generation\" and the perceived demise of contemporary black politics. Race and Reproduction SCA-UA 158 Offered every other year. 4 points. Race and Reproduction is an interdisciplinary course that examines the connections between gender, racial ideology and history of medicine to consider the range of ways that reproduction\u2014medically, culturally, and experientially\u2014produces and troubles racial ideology. In this course we will explore issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on North American contexts. Cross-cultural breadth will help us to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and socio-cultural context. While questions about biology will be central to this history, we will also locate biology within a wider set of issues around social reproduction and the practices of motherhood. Through our readings we will consider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) help us to illuminate and problematize the connections between technologies and politics of biology and difference.             Language and Liberation: At Home in the  Caribbean and Abroad SCA-UA 163 Identical to LING-UA 26.  Offered every year. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural  transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from  17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. The focus  is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the  freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity.  Discusses the sociohistorical conditions that led to the creation of  new Caribbean languages called \u201cpidgins\u201d and \u201ccreoles\u201d as the  English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World.          The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 Offered once every year. 4  points. Cities have played an important role  throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts:  from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of  well-known West African civilizations (such as Ghana, Mali, and  Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in  the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In  attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in  accounting for the way proximity structures interpersonal  experiences\u2014this course uses ethnographic, sociological,  historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We  explore the contours of these urban matrices through special  attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the  way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history  (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part  of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third  World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian  postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of  European exploitation. Instead of proceeding strictly  chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience  thematically, through a diverse array of readings.          Topics in Africana Studies SCA-UA 180 Offered once a semester. 4  points. Explores specific issues dealing with  the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural  institutions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester,  include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education,  sports, music, and art.          Topics in Pan-Africanism SCA-UA 181 Offered once a semester. 4  points. Deals with specific themes of  Pan-Africanism and their impact on the modern world. Possible themes,  which vary from semester to semester, include African unity, black  rebellion, colonialism and racism, the African diaspora and culture,  and relationships between Pan-Africanism and movements such as  nationalism, Marxism, and Afrocentricity.      Language Courses          Elementary Swahili I SCA-UA 121 Offered every year. 4  points. Provides students with an elementary  understanding of Swahili, a Bantu language with a rich oral and  written tradition that is spoken by about 100 million people from  Somalia to Mozambique and Zanzibar. After a short presentation of  Swahili\u2019s history, codification, and relation to other languages,  students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also  introduced to poems, songs, and oral narratives.          Elementary Swahili II SCA-UA 122 Prerequisite: Elementary  Swahili I (SCA-UA 121) or permission of the instructor. Offered every  year. 4 points. Expands on the basic knowledge of the  pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental  grammatical features acquired in Swahili I. Allows essential  communication skills to develop into conversational ability using  simple and familiar situations. Building on the early grasp of the  language, students expand the range of conversational ability and  understanding of various grammatical concepts associated with this  agglutinative language.          Intermediate Swahili I SCA-UA 123 Prerequisite: Elementary  Swahili II (SCA-UA 122) or permission of the instructor. Offered  every year. 4 points. Builds on the basic knowledge of the  pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental  grammatical features already attained at the introductory level. Aims  to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills by accessing  a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language,  its cultural context, and literary genre. Students are required to  familiarize themselves with a novel and a play written in Kiswahili.          Intermediate Swahili II SCA-UA 124 Prerequisite: Intermediate  Swahili I (SCA-UA 123) or permission of the instructor. Offered every  year. 4 points. Aims to enable students to communicate  entirely in Kiswahili, to carry out bidirectional translation from  Swahili to English and from English to Swahili, and to negotiate  technical language. At this level, students would master the  intricacies of Kiswahili grammar; acquire a wide range of vocabulary;  read Kiswahili fluently; understand Kiswahili poetry, idioms, and  proverbs; and use idiomatic Kiswahili in creative writing and  translation.
