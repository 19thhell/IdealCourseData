And I think anything in the 5 to 7 percent range is actually quite healthy as long as the economy is reforming, moving to a consumption-based economy and moving to an innovation-based economy. So I think it's good news.\"     Read more                                                                                                                 News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.
