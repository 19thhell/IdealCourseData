teaching preschool and elementary science. Science experiences for elementary students are developed, and strategies for implementation and evaluation are devised.          SCIED-GE 2009    Science Experiences in the Elementary School I    Science experiences for elementary school are developed and strategies for implementation and evaluation are devised. Issues such as basic attitutdes toward science, equity in the science classroom, and learning styles will be explored. Students will develop a catalogue of resources, both in print and on-line, for expanding understanding of science content, developing science skills, integrating science into the rest of the curriculum, exploring science activities appropriate for children and assessing science teaching and learning.          SCIED-GE 2015    Recent Advances in Physics    Thematically organized course in which principles from contemporary work in physics are brought to bear on such topics as energy, communications, and scientific methodology.          SCIED-GE 2016    Recent Advances in Chemistry    Thematically organized course in which principles from contemporary work in chemistry and biochemistry are examined.          SCIED-GE 2017    Recent Advances in Biological Science    Thematically organized course that examines the agricultural revolution, limits to growth, biophysical interactions, and social biology from the perspective of contemporary findings.          SCIED-GE 2018    Breakthroughs in Science    A interactive series of Saturday morning seminars on current research topics by scientists from diverse physical and biological and medical fields constitute the focus of this course. The seminars form the basis for further inquiry by participants and the devilment of lesson plans that will address student learning and interest and New York State science standards. The topics presented will vary from year to year and can come from a variety of science fields including molecular biology, anthropology, biomedical science, developmental studies, cosmology, modern physics and material science.          SCIED-GE 2021    Science in Historical Perspective    This course involves looking at the history of science in many of the world's cultures from different perspectives. The history of racism and sexism in science is explored along with the history of Western and nonwestern science.          SCIED-GE 2031    Measuring Outcomes of Science Teaching    Emphasis in on the development of skill in the construction, administration, and interpretation of tests to measure the knowledge.          SCIED-GE 2039    Methods II: Teaching Science in Middle School and High School    This field-based course explores theoretical and practical frameworks for designing and implementing classroom management, integration of science with other disciplines, reading and science, traditional and alternative assessment, and multicultural science teaching. The use of technology as an instructional tool to support learning and communication are applied to teaching and learning situations as an integral aspect of the course.          SCIED-GE 2040    Methods II: Teaching Science in Middle School and High School    The relationship between learning outcomes and assessment is considered in relation to how it influences instructional decisions especially with respect to development of curriculum. The roles of instructional strategies, motivation, classroom management, curriculum and technology are addressed as a means of sustaining learner interest and cooperation.          SCIED-GE 2042    The Scientific Enterprise    Study of the professional practice of science in its social, political, and economic contexts. The relationship between science and technology and its implications for economic and social policy are also explored.          SCIED-GE 2050    Using NYC Non Formal Science Resources to Teach Science    Designed to strengthen teacher perceptions of the non formal sites, instructional offerings, and compatibility with the formal school curriculum. Classes meet at the different non formal teaching sites in the metropolitan area. Sites include New York Hall of Science; Brooklyn and New York Botanical Gardens; American Museum of Natural History; Aquarium for Wildlife Conservation; Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum; and Liberty Science Center.          SCIED-GE 2052    Field Studies in Ecology at Black Rock Forest, Cornwall, New York    Field ecology at Black Rock Forest is a concentrated spring graduate field course in ecology &amp; biology. Student become familiar with the flora &amp; fauna of the Hudson Highlands region of New York as they study the major natural habitats within the area (A visit to Central Park before the trip permits comparison of urban versus rural issues in ecology). Field exercises have included plant community sampling, paleoecological analysis of sediment cores, characterization of shrub communities using diagnostic keys, &amp; survey of birds/insects/amphibians/aquatic invertebrates. Readings from Science, Nature, Ecology &amp; other literature are carefully coordinated with our field studies.          SCIED-GE 2092    Science Curriculum: Intermediate and Secondary Schools    Analyzing and developing curricula and textbooks for teaching science are the principal themes of this course. Students acquire and use a variety of conceptual frameworks to comprehend differences among curriculum materials and then to construct teaching materials for themselves.          SCIED-GE 2100    Culminating Seminar: Teacher as Researcher, Reflective Practitioner, and Curriculum Developer    An individualized project that reflects a student's understanding of science teachings and learning and the student's philosophical underpinnings developed throughout his or her entire program.          SCIED-GE 2135    Supervision of Science    Implementation and supervision of science strategies geared to the improvement of science teaching in the schools.          SCIED-GE 2300    Independent Study    It should be noted that independent study requires a minimum of 45 hours of work per point. Independent study cannot be applied to the established professional education sequence in teaching curricula. Each departmental program has established its own maximum credit allowance for independent study. This information may be obtained from a student?s department.

Issues of transition planning, curriculum development, instructional planning, uses of technology, identifying strengths and differentiating instruction, with a special focus on the development of literacy skills and processes that promote social skill development and interpersonal communication                   General Pedagogical Core Syllabi and Course Descriptions          Course ID Title Description             TCHL-GE 2000    Field Consultations    On-site consultation for in-service personnel by faculty on such problems as goal selection, curriculum development, or evaluation. In-service personnel and faculty sponsor mutually identify a problem and develop and implement a plan. May be taken on group or individual basis. Registration requires submission of field consultation from and approval of faculty sponsor and program director.          TCHL-GE 2010    Inquiries Into Teaching &amp; Learning III    Introduces graduate level preservice teachers to the complexities of teaching by exploring four major themes -- learning, knowledge and knowing, teachers and teaching, schools and schooling. Each theme is investigated by analyzing issues of the learner's autobiography, the challenges of diversity, the power of collaboration, and uses of reflection. Students read and respond to a range of relevant tests, engage in observation of an elementary or secondary school classroom, create a classroom portrait with a focus on a particular learner, and produce a learning portfolio.          TCHL-GE 2013    Applied Research Design    Based on the formal principles of experimental and survey design, this course prepares students to design sound quantitative research studies that take into account the practical constraints of the real world. Topics include formulating research questions, identifying relevant target populations, selecting and sampling study participants, choosing which predictors to study, defining comparison groups, identifying appropriate measures, determining sample size, and evaluating the outcomes. Appropriate for doctoral students preparing to write a dissertation proposal.          TCHL-GE 2132    Evaluating Educational Programs    Appropriate methods of assessment of educational programs with emphasis on evaluative procedures for developers and users and consideration of materials and effectiveness of programs; focus on teacher's need for evaluation skills.          TCHL-GE 2275    Language &amp; Literacy Acquisition &amp; Development    Explores the interconnections among the acquisition of first (and second) language and the development of print and media literacy from birth through adolescence. Emphases are placed on the interactions of reading and writing with a focus on those children who make transitions and acquire the appropriate skills easily, as well as those who find it more difficult, particularly in middle childhood and adolescence. The implications for literacy education for students speaking a second language or a variety of English are also explored in the context of urban education.
