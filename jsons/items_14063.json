Koonin \u2013 a theoretical physicist who has served as Undersecretary of Energy for Science, Chief Scientist of BP, and Provost of the California Institute of Technology \u2013 as the Director of the new Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), an applied science and engineering institute created by NYU as a consortium of world-class universities, global technology corporations, and innovative urban designers.    Koonin\u2019s appointment came as New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg \u2013 accompanied by NYU President John Sexton and Dr. Koonin at a press conference in Brooklyn \u2013 announced the designation of CUSP as one of the winning proposals submitted in response to Applied Sciences NYC, a major City economic development initiative to increase New York\u2019s capacity in the applied sciences and spur the growth of new tech-related businesses and jobs.    NYU President John Sexton said, \u201cThe creation of CUSP \u2013 and the announcement by Mayor Bloomberg of its designation as one of the Applied Sciences NYC winners -- is an extraordinarily exciting event for NYU. Its research and academic programs will address one of the most pressing and pervasive challenges of our times \u2013 how to make an increasingly urbanized world work better. CUSP is not merely a new educational program or a new research center \u2013 it will be an incubator for an entirely new industry.    \u201cAn undertaking such as CUSP requires a person of exceptional talents \u2013 a scientist of outstanding abilities and credentials; a proven and experienced leader; and a person with the vision and entrepreneurial spirit necessary not only to create a new enterprise, but to aim it at solving some of the world\u2019s great challenges. In Steve Koonin, we have found such a person. By dint of talent, accomplishments, knowledge, attitude, and energy, he\u2019s a perfect fit. Recruiting a scientist of Steve\u2019s stature is a tremendous validation of the idea at the heart of CUSP, and its promise.\u201d    Sr. Vice Provost for Research Paul Horn said, \u201cSteve Koonin is an exceptional choice to be CUSP\u2019s director. His record of directing scientific efforts to solve complex and seemingly intractable problems makes him stand out as a leader in the scientific community. I don\u2019t think there is anyone better suited to be CUSP\u2019s founding director, to ensure excellence in its research agenda, and to focus on translating the research and discoveries into real-world, commercializable solutions. We are very fortunate to have Steve coming on board, and, on behalf of the entire NYU community, we welcome him and offer our congratulations on this new assignment.\u201d    Director Koonin said of his appointment: \u201cNYU and its partners have envisioned a remarkable enterprise that will simultaneously improve the workings of the City, advance technology, spur economic activity, and educate a global population of students in the development and application of Urban Science. I am extraordinarily energized to be returning to New York City to work with CUSP\u2019s partners and other stakeholders to realize that vision; there is no place better to be doing this work.\u201d     Dr. Koonin was confirmed by the Senate in May, 2009 as Undersecretary for Science at the U.S. Department of Energy, serving in that position until November, 2011. Prior to joining the Obama Administration, he was BP\u2019s Chief Scientist, where he was a strong advocate for research into renewable energies and alternate fuel sources. He came to BP in 2004 following almost 3 decades as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology, serving as the Institute\u2019s Vice President and Provost for the last nine years. Koonin comes to CUSP most immediately from a position at the Science and Technology Policy Institute of the Institute for Defense Analyses in Washington, DC.   Koonin\u2019s research interests have included nuclear astrophysics; theoretical nuclear, computational, and many-body physics; and global environmental science. He has been involved in scientific computing throughout his career. He has supervised more than 30 PhD students, produced more than 200 peer-reviewed research publications, and authored or edited 3 books, including a pioneering textbook on Computational Physics in 1985. As Caltech\u2019s Provost, Koonin oversaw its research and educational programs, including the hiring of one-third of the Institute\u2019s faculty. At BP, he conceived and established the Energy Bioscience Institute at UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois, while at DOE, he led the preparation of both its most recent Strategic Plan and its first Quadrennial Technology Review for energy. Koonin has served as an advisor for numerous academic, government, and for-profit organizations.   Dr. Koonin is the recipient of numerous awards and honors, including the George Green Prize for Creative Scholarship at Caltech, a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Fellowship, and a Senior U.S. Scientist Award (Humboldt Prize), and the Department of Energy\u2019s Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award. He is a Fellow of several professional societies, including the American Physical Society, the American Association of the Advancement of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.    Koonin was born in Brooklyn, NY and graduated from Stuyvesant High School in 1968. He received his B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology in 1972 and his Ph.D. in theoretical physics from MIT in 1975. He and his wife Laurie have been married for 37 years and have three children: Anna (27), Alyson (24), and Benjamin (22).

Prior to his NYU appointment, Dr. Koonin served as the second Under Secretary for Science at the U.S. Department of Energy from May 2009 through November 2011. In that capacity, he oversaw technical activities across the Department\u2019s science, energy, and security activities and led the Department\u2019s first Quadrennial Technology Review for energy. Before joining the government, Dr. Koonin spent five years as Chief Scientist for BP plc, where he played a central role in establishing the Energy Biosciences Institute. Dr. Koonin was a professor of theoretical physics at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) from 1975-2006 and was the Institute\u2019s Provost for almost a decade. He is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the JASON advisory group. Dr. Koonin holds a B.S. in Physics from Caltech and a Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from MIT (1975) and is an adjunct staff member at the Institute for Defense Analyses.
