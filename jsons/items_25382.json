It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence\u201d. The majority of NYU students are sexually active, and college is a time when many young people first become sexually active. Students frequently enter college without adequate sexual health knowledge, and, subsequently, they often engage in sexual behaviors that place them at increased risk for unintended health outcomes such as pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It is crucial to enhance sexual health resources to improve students\u2019 sexual health, increase safer sex behaviors, and reduce STI and HIV transmission.             Key Facts     64.7% of NYU students reported engaging in oral, vaginal, or anal intercourse within the last 12 months. 1   In 2009, there were 48,100 new HIV cases in the United States, with 19.7% occurring in young people age 15 to 24. 2   Although young people ages 15 to 24 represent 25% of the sexually experienced population, this age group accounts for nearly 50% of all new STIs, totaling about 9 million cases in 2008. 3   Over 1.2 million cases of chlamydia were reported in 2008, the most since record keeping for the disease began and the highest number of cases for any STI required to be reported by physicians. 3   20 to 24-year-olds are significantly more likely to experience an unintended pregnancy than women aged 19 or younger. 4   STI rates are twice as common among 20 to 24-year-olds as 15 to 19-year-olds (7 v. 3%). 5   Many young people misperceive their vulnerability to infection, which can affect  decisions around sexual behavior. 6                Suggestions for Administrators &amp; Staff     This page is intended to be a resource containing suggestions for what you can do to help increase students' sexual health knowledge and better manage their engagement in healthy sexual behaviors.   \u2022 Attend Safe Zone training to become a visible ally to NYU\u2019s LGBTQ community. Creating a university environment that is sensitive, safe, respectful and inclusive supports and encourages positive interpersonal interactions. Sign up for Safe Zoning training .     \u2022 Promote the use of safer sex supplies. Many students report wanting to use safer sex supplies but do not due to lack of money or fear of judgment when purchasing them. 20 The distribution of free safer sex supplies on a university campus can be effective in increasing condom use, reducing new cases of sexually transmitted infections,and preventing unplanned pregnancies.     o Be knowledgeable about where free condoms are available on campus. For NYU students who choose to be sexually active, free safer sex supplies are available at the Health Promotion Office (stop by the 3rd Floor of 726 Broadway). Staff and Health Leaders are also available to answer any questions students may have about safer sex, contraception, or sexually transmitted infections. The Student Resource Center, LGBTQ Student Center, Center for Center for Multicultural Education and Programs, and all of the residence halls have condoms free available to students in communal spaces.     o Offer free safe sex supplies in communal areas such as residence halls, student lounges, or bathrooms. To obtain a free supply of condoms for distribution, contact the Health Promotion Office or the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.     \u2022 Be knowledgeable about NYU\u2019s sexual health services for students and able to refer them to the appropriate resources when necessary. Visit the NYU Student Health Center website to find out about specific services or review the Sexual Health Resource Guide , which provides a listing of programs and resources throughout campus for students to manage engagement in their own sexual health behaviors or to get involved with broader sexual health issues.     \u2022 Host events and discussions around sexual health issues. Students\u2019 knowledge, values, attitudes, and beliefs influence their sexual health decisions and behaviors. Bringing in speakers to lead discussions on the evolving societal views on issues around gender, sexuality, sexual and reproductive rights, HIV/AIDS, or socio-economic driven health inequalities can be a great opportunity to challenge students\u2019 preconceived notions and perceptions which ultimately can influence their sexual health. This can be a great way to collaborate with the Student Health Center, an NYU faculty member, or colleagues within Student Affairs. Hosting fun events, such as a trip to the Sex Museum or a movie screening, can also be a great way to facilitate awareness around sexual health issues and reach students who may not feel comfortable talking directly about these issues                                                                                          Indicator Technical Notes                               a) HIV Testing       Data Source: ACHA #39F   Survey Question: Have you ever been tested for HIV infection?
