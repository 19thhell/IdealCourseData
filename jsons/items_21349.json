By Alex Cotton     Originally published in citylimits.org , November, 2008           Until now, the phrase digital divide has been used to describe the difference between those with home computers and easy access to the Internet and those without. But what about people without television? As the major broadcasters switch from using analog to digital signals this February, activists warn the digital divide may take on a new meaning, leaving thousands of New York Citys most vulnerable with blank TVs.    Several digital developments have evolved in recent months to spell change for peoples relationship with their gadgets. Looming large among them is the February 17 deadline, required by law, for all major television networks to broadcast in digital only. In addition to providing sharper images and better sound, the use of digital signals will free up segments of the airwaves for other uses, such as broadband Internet (see below for more on this). However, anyone with an analog television who uses rabbit-ears or a rooftop antenna rather than a pay service like cable (see specifications in detail here), will find themselves staring at a screen full of snow. Nationwide roughly 21 million people rely on analog televisions, a group that disproportionately includes the poor, minorities, senior citizens and the disabled.    The federal government has taken steps to address this potential problem. In addition to launching an education campaign, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) a bureau of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce has made coupons available for purchasing converter boxes that allow analog televisions to receive digital signals. City agencies have joined the education effort, whether including notices in public housing newsletters or ensuring that electronics stores notify their customers that analog televisions will soon require converters to work properly.    Activists, however, are concerned that the message will not be heard by all who need it. According to Mark Lloyd, a vice president at the D.C. -based Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the $5 million made available by congress for the NTIA to conduct consumer education was far too little. Both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and NTIA, Lloyd said, have done a good job of communicating with vulnerable populations, whether these are the elderly, disabled, immigrants, or people working two jobs, with the money they have. But they have not been given enough for this very complicated transition, he said. According to a recent Nielsen report, nearly 4 percent of New York City households are completely unready for the transition.    Thomas Kamber, executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, is also concerned that New Yorks seniors may be missing the message. TV is more than entertainment when youre 75 or 80, he said. For isolated, low-income seniors, TV provides the sounds of a voice and images that carry them through the day. If it goes dark, that will be a real blow. He also points out that TV is an important source of information for many seniors, and that according to a New York Academy of Medicine report, lack of access to information is one of the top problems facing New Yorks elderly. Back in May, Kambers organization led one information session about the digital transition at a Staten Island senior center, but was unable to hold additional sessions when 80 percent of OATS City Council funding was cut over the summer.    Jimmy Flynn, a salesman at a Flatbush P.C. Richards &amp; Son, which sells televisions and other electronics, has noticed that some of his elderly customers dont grasp how the digital transition could affect them. He counsels people to buy digital televisions, but has sold a few analogs to seniors over the past year when they didnt follow his advice. Some older folks dont understand the new process, he said.    Putting the web into &#8220;white spaces&#8221;    Earlier this month the five-member FCC voted unanimously to open up unused portions of the television spectrum, or white spaces, for public use. The availability of these white spaces, according to wireless experts, could make broadband Internet i.e. the fast kind cheaper and more widely available within a few years, and help to bridge the digital divide.    Television spectrum including white spaces has been largely controlled by major television broadcasters, with white spaces serving as buffers between channels to prevent interference. With the switch from analog to digital broadcasting coming early next year, however, the FCC has decided that the buffers are no longer necessary. On Nov. 4, the FCC voted unanimously to free them up.    White spaces have the potential to connect tens of millions of Americans now off the grid, either because they dont have the necessary infrastructure in their area or they cant afford it, said Timothy Karr, campaign director at the national media reform organization Free Press. He pointed out that in New York City, white spaces account for one-fifth of the public airwaves.    Although no Internet devices on the market make use of white spaces, technology companies from Motorola to Google are lined up to create a new generation of hand-held, wireless devices able to access the Internet wherever public airwaves are available (which means pretty much everywhere). Current wireless devices, on the other hand, such as Apple iPhones, rely on already existing proprietary networks like AT &amp;T or SprintNextel to connect to the Internet, rather than the new spectrum that will be opened up by white spaces. Were talking about a platform for innovation, said Joshua Breitbart, policy director for Peoples Production House, a local media education and activism group. He said that such devices would make access to the Internet cheaper, since a wireless infrastructure is relatively low cost. Internet prices are currently inflated due to a lack of competition, Breitbart said: Broadband access is now a duopoly locally, comprised of Time Warner Cable and Verizon DSL in some areas of the city, and Verizon and Cablevision in others.    Breitbart also argues that mobile, cell phone-like white space Internet devices could go a long way toward connecting more minorities to the web. Citing research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, he points out that when it comes to who is using cell phones, the technology divide is much less pronounced. It appears that Latinos and African-Americans may be more likely to access the Internet through new portable devices than using currently available technologies. People want access to the Internet through mobile devices, he said. Its a more meaningful alternative for a lot of people.    Everyones not as excited as Breitbart, however. Lobbying groups such as the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA) asked the FCC to carry out more testing before its decision, raising concerns that public usage of white spaces could cause interference with television signals, and other devices including wireless microphones. There are transition issues people will have to deal with, said Dave Baylor, Secretary General of NABA, referring to the digital television transition, and we believe adding any other variable to the pot at this point is a real issue.    The City Council also passed a resolution expressing its concern that white space devices could interfere with wireless microphone users, such as Broadway shows, which depend on the same portion of the spectrum. But digital media activists remain confident that in a few years, white space devices will provide the public with an effective and inexpensive way to access the Internet. The key is to take advantage, says Breitbart: The oil of the information world &#8230; is sitting on the surface.    Decreasing the divide    Even if New Yorkers have to cool their heels until white space devices are available, some public housing residents will receive a technology upgrade sooner. Over the next three years, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) will build 15 new computer labs at public housing complexes, and offer a variety of job training and computer literacy classes to go along with them.    The project was made possible by a $600,000 grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and will be carried out in partnership with City College of New York (CCNY). A third of the money will be used to build or update existing computer labs, while the rest will be used by CCNY to develop a curriculum and hire instructors. The classes offered will range from GED preparation and job training to Internet literacy. Were making strides towards bridging the digital divide, said Ukah Busgith, deputy director at NYCHA s Department of Administration.    Its a promising development, said Mary McCormick, president of the Fund for the City of New York, an organization that develops policy and technology solutions for government and non-profits. But unless we implement it really well, in four years, they may be replacing the labs again, without much to show for it. McCormick points out that in the past there have been major investments in computer hardware for the underserved without the necessary computer education or maintenance.    The consequences of the digital divide are profound, McCormick said. The people who suffer most are young people. There is no way to prepare for a successful adulthood if you grow up without computers.    Currently, NYCHA runs 94 computer labs in its 343 housing developments. Five of the new or updated computer labs will open in February, with 10 more to follow over the next two years. The classes will be available for anyone age 13 or older, and NYCHA plans to provide instruction to 720 residents over the course of the project.    Reshaping local radio    As digital media access activists honed in on the Internet and television, a storm has come and gone in the world of radio. A new system for measuring radio stations popularity developed by the radio ratings leader, Arbitron, was recently unveiled in New York and seven other cities. It led to an outcry from minority-owned and -focused radio stations, which claim that their ratings were unfairly lowered by the new system possibly threatening their very existence.    Akin to Nielsens ratings of television show viewership, Arbitron has long used a diary system to provide similar ratings for radio programs. The ratings are then used to determine the cost of advertising on any given radio station. However, Arbitron recently replaced the diary system in which members of the public report their radio listening habits with the Portable People Meter (PPM), a small electronic device that automatically records whatever radio stations are playing in its vicinity. (So you could be listening to WBLS at home, but on a trip to the bodega the PPM also records K-Rock playing in the store.) Our goal with the commercialization of the PPM is to help radio remain competitive in an increasingly challenging media marketplace, Arbitron CEO Steve Morris said in a release.    The PPM system went into effect in New York City in October, and caused a drop-off in ratings for many Spanish language radio stations. If you compare the diary ratings in the spring to PPM ratings this month, the fall-off in ratings is as high as 60 to 70 percent in certain Spanish language radio stations and day parts, said Frank Flores, vice president and market manager for Spanish Broadcasting System New York, adding that such ratings dives could force some stations out of business because of lower ad revenue. Spanish Broadcasting System, which owns or operates 21 radio stations nationally, has refused to negotiate with advertisers based on the new numbers, claiming they are inaccurate. The dramatic and drastic fall in ratings seems to happen in large part only to black and Hispanic stations, said Flores.    Flores and others argue that the error is caused not by the new technology itself, but by the new sampling system Arbitron has adopted, which they believe undercounts minorities. Flores says that with the diary system, the zip codes of the individuals who recorded their radio habits were released, and he could verify that an appropriate number were drawn from high density black and Hispanic areas. With the new system, however, Arbitron has refused to release zip code information as a measure to prevent tampering with their samples. In the meantime, Flores has asked Arbitron to revise its new sampling system by taking into account factors such as listeners&#8217; country of origin and other variables to guarantee that a proper number and variety of Latinos are sampled, arguing that this will make data more representative. But he has yet to see any changes. Their timetable for addressing these concerns is six months to a year, but the problem is immediate, he said. Arbitron maintains that it exceeded its sample target of blacks by 13 percent and of Hispanics by 23 percent.    The City Council took a position on this media matter, too, recently passing a resolution calling on the FCC to investigate the PPM system. The new Arbitron system, which has been used in other states, already caused major changes in the ratings of stations, said Councilman Leroy Comrie, chairman of the Consumer Affairs Committee, referring to the effects that PPM already has demonstrated in Philadelphia and Texas. Additionally, a lawsuit against Arbitron has been launched by the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for false advertising and deceptive business practices surrounding its PPM system.    Although Arbitron has been willing to meet with the City Council, Comrie remains frustrated that they have not taken any action to address his concerns, and worries about the consequences of decreasing revenue for minority radio stations. We are fighting to maintain local cultural influence over news and music, he said. Its important that we not wind up only having superstations.

Additionally, a lawsuit against Arbitron has been launched by the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for false advertising and deceptive business practices surrounding its PPM system.    Although Arbitron has been willing to meet with the City Council, Comrie remains frustrated that they have not taken any action to address his concerns, and worries about the consequences of decreasing revenue for minority radio stations. We are fighting to maintain local cultural influence over news and music, he said. Its important that we not wind up only having superstations.

As we have heard from the other speakers here today, certain themes, such as the effectiveness of disaster plans, success and failure with external recovery services, the fate of private collection, and the risk of cultural collapse, continually repeat themselves. It is crucial that we understand the weight of these issues, and bear them in mind for future disaster planning and recovery efforts.    In February and March of this year I spent about 2 weeks in New Orleans, talking with staff at libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions, as well as individual artists, about their personal and professional experiences dealing with Katrina. My goal was to gather information to supplement the existing literature on disaster preparedness and recovery, with emphasis on collections with audiovisual media. The constraints on underfunded and underdeveloped communities were always kept in mind. What follows will be a summary of the lessons I learned from New Orleans.                 Lesson #1: Effectiveness of Disaster Plans    When I began research in New Orleans, I didn't realize the extent of the inadequacies of disaster preparedness plans. Aside from outlining the usual hurricane preparation procedures that people in the Gulf Coast are used to, the plans were basically useless. One of the biggest lessons learned by everyone in the area is that you can't prepare for everything.     Most institutions had been through a number of hurricane preparations before, and were used to the drill of boarding windows, unplugging electrical equipment, moving collections away from windows and off floors. However, most agreed that plans simply did not address a disaster of this scale. Traditional disaster planning literature assumes that the event is localized, that is, confined to the building itself, not the entire area. When area-wide disasters are addressed, they still presume that staff will be able to re-enter the building within a reasonable amount of time. But could there possibly be a written document that provides instructions on coping with the total infrastructure collapse of a city? Of course the answer is no.     Indeed, you can't prepare for everything, nor should the planning process attempt to. When planning for disasters, the point is not to attempt to predict every possible situation. Disaster preparedness guidebooks appear to presume this is achievable by outlining endless scenarios that one might encounter. Instead, the approach should be to equip the building, collections, and staff with the appropriate tools to deal with disasters. Rather than conceiving of a disaster plan as a document, that almost all people will ignore once it is created, it must be a way of thinking. Emergency response should not be numerical lists on paper. Rather, it should be, and will be most effective if it becomes an instinctual reaction, for this is how people will inevitably deal with an emergency. The planning process should involve increasing staff awareness of what external recovery services would be used in an emergency (for audiovisual media this could probably be a lab that the institution works with regularly), what collections have priority, where emergency supplies are kept, and where to find communications information in an instant. Thus, the only reason one would need to turn to the written document is to find telephone numbers and possibly salvage procedures for specific media. It should not be something that has to be read at the time of a disaster; this simply will not work.      One word that has been repeated by everyone is communication. Lack of thorough contact information for personnel was possibly the #1 cited problem with disaster plans. While it is very difficult to cope with loss of power, cell phone towers, and landlines, many people feel that disaster plans could have incorporated better alternative communication venues (such as web-based email Yahoo, Google). We've heard this already today, yet it is worth repeating here to emphasize the magnitude of this issue. When planning for emergencies, don't neglect to establish every possible line of communication between staff members. This is the crux of good disaster planning.     Lesson #2: External Recovery Resources    Building alliances with sister institutions was recognized by many people to have been a savior. Others found that professional recovery services could deal with the problem efficiently. Yet a number of institutions are finding that the service contracted by high-level administration was inadequate for the collections needs. This issue goes highlights the necessity of integrating the collection's disaster plan with the larger institution's plan. Always be sure that your library, archive, or department within a larger organization has discussed emergency preparedness plans with the administration.     The most effective way to ensure that these measures will be successful is to establish them in advance. Collection managers that had discussed external assistance before Katrina with upper administration found that they were happy with the results. Those that did not articulate the specialized needs of library and archival materials to the decision making bodies that were forced to make decisions for the entire organization (such as university or government institutions), were sometimes stuck with contractors that didn't take proper care to protect artifacts. Even though these services are meant to help, they can sometimes do more damage than good. A few institutions feel that the rebuilding efforts of some contractors will not be adequate to protect the collections in the future.      On the reverse side, there is also the issue of assisting other institutions. Louisiana State University and the Archives of the Diocese of Baton Rouge (which some of you may have heard from yesterday) provided a lot of assistance to damaged institutions, and did their best to utilize their disaster plan to help others in this case. The massive cleaning and drying effort that took place at these institutions were an incredible boon to some of the collecting institutions of the Gulf Coast. Fortunately, they were prepared to take on this endeavor. When negotiating reciprocal recovery assistance with other institutions, be sure that you have the training, staff, and space to take on large collection damage. As Diocese of BR Archivist Emilie Leumans pointed out yesterday, update disaster plans to include information on taking in evacuated collections and staff.     Lesson # 3: Unfortunate fate of private collections     Katrina caused undoubtedly catastrophic damage to New Orleans rich cultural heritage. Worst hit was not the collecting institutions; rather, it was private collectors, artists and musicians whose collections suffered the most. Well-known local musicians including Fats Domino and Danny Barker lost nearly all of their personal memorabilia. The simple fact is that individuals were more vulnerable than institutions, whose mission is specifically to safeguard cultural materials, and whose staff are trained to handle damaged artifacts.      As an example of, I'd like to talk about the story of Helen Hill, a local experimental filmmaker and animator, whose home was badly flooded. Helen, her husband Paul, and their son Francis, are temporarily living in Columbia, SC. Although I don't have time to go intotheir incrediblestory in detail, I'd like to talk a moment about Helen's experience with recovering her films.                         Helen and Paul were able to return to New Orleans about a month after the flood to gather anything that remained of their home. Her films, which are mainly 16mm and Super 8mm shorts and home movies, both color and black and white, had been kept at home, where she found them with varying degrees of damage. Some had stayed dry, others had been submerged and become mold infested. A few months after settling in in Columbia, Helen decided to send her films to a lab to have them cleaned. Being an experimental filmmaker who has worked extensively with manipulated and damaged film that she either found or distorted herself, she knew that even with damage to the images she would be able to find a use for them in future films.          Unfortunately, Bono Film and Video Lab in Arlington, Virginia, rejected the films for cleaning, saying they were beyond recovery.                 Determined not to completely lose her work, Hill decided to clean the films herself. After a struggle to find any information online about film cleaning, Helen eventually learned about a product called FilmRenew, sold by Urbanski Film. She learned the proper method for using the cleaner, and in the basement, set up rewinds on a dining table that she bought at a garage sale and went to work. Her process has involved soaking the films in FilmRenew for different lengths of time, then wiping them with old cotton rags as they are run through the rewinds.           Although most of the films suffered irreversible damage, the cleaning process has been relatively successful. Helen has had some of the cleaned films reprinted on an optical printer, and has shown them at symposiums and festivals around the country. Still, the original unique surfaces that Helen had created using hand processing, and tinting and toning are lost. Worse still, what remains of the irreplaceable home movies are forever scarred with the patterns left by mold and water.              The good news is that Helen will be able to track down some of the prints and negatives of her original short films around North America. Following this step, Hill plans on storing the remaining titles at a film collective in Canada. She feels that in addition to providing distribution services, the collective will be better equipped to protect the films from disasters. Her hope is that the collective is better prepared to safeguard films than she is at home, and at least if the power fails in Canada, the heat and humidity are less likely to be a threat.      There have always been tensions between artists/private collectors and collecting institutions. Creators often feel that their original works belong with them at home. Collectors don't want to put their amassed materials in a place where they will not be able to access items at will. However, following Katrina, many of these people are beginning to reconsider. Individuals whose homes and belongings were damaged immediately turned to archives with the hope that their staff might be able to save what remained. The Danny Barker collection could have found a home before Katrina, had the estate not prioritized financial compensation over preservation. What people seem to have realized since the disaster is that though it may appear that such collections should have high monetary value, they are worth nothing if they don't exist.            It would be a stretch to argue that all collections should be donated to an institution. Museums, libraries, and archives are often under-funded and under-staffed. Yet their entire responsibility is to ensure the preservation of cultural heritage, a task which most people do not have time to do all alone. Katrina has made a clear case for individuals to reconsider who may be the best caretaker of their collection. Even Helen Hill, a young filmmaker whose body of work is still growing, feels that donating prints to a collective will at least provide backup in case of another emergency.           Lesson #3: Risk of cultural Collapse     The loss of cultural collections brings to light an even greater potential loss that the city of New Orleans is facing: the loss of their unique culture. Residents are leaving the city and settling elsewhere for lack of housing. David Freedman, general manager of WWOZ, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Radio Station (which lost its home, and came within inches of losing 1500 hours of original recordings), put it very bluntly in our conversation in March: if people do not return, if the infrastructure of the city is not rebuilt soon enough to attract old residents, the cultural production of the city may be idle. A number of current and former residents that I have spoken with expressed the same fears.      Freedman described to me an inimitable city, one where the local musicians had a unique way of working together and exchanging ideas. The local music scene had a very distinct flavor: Cajun and Creole rhythms blended with Jazz and Blues, the sounds of Rock-n-Roll mingled with Mardi Gras Indian chants, and Brazilian and Caribbean influences weaved into all styles.       The rhythms and styles unique to New Orleans are not written in music textbooks. They cannot be learned from reading sheet music. Generation after generation, the city's musicians have learned their art through two venues: church gospel choirs and high school marching bands. Renowned nationwide, New Orleans high school marching bands are the highlight of all Mardi Gras parades. Through their music instructors, who learned from their band instructors, young musicians gain an irreplaceable set of knowledge. This they carry through their musical career, building and expanding it, then passing it along to the next generation.      With the flood and total infrastructure collapse of the city that followed, schools closed, churches were destroyed, and entire communities disappeared. As the beginning of the Spring 2006 semester, 20 public schools were open in Orleans Parish, educating approximately 15,000 students, down from nearly 60,000. Although the New Orleans public school system was one of the lowest performing in the country before Katrina, there was still strength in musical traditions. According to Freedman, who is on the local Music Education Commission, the city's schools are now under tremendous pressure to perform well academically. If a school does not receive a 50% passing grade, it will be shut down. Sadly, music and arts are not part of the evaluation, and have been cut from the curriculum so students can focus entirely on academics. Without the curriculum, the teachers, and the students, development in New Orleans music is at a total standstill.      Reductions in the overall population reflect the trend of smaller staff sizes at various cultural institutions in the city. The reductions in staff size and funding for both recovery and day-to-day operations are possibly even larger a threat to many institutions and collections than the hurricane itself. So many institutions and businesses that have re-opened are facing the danger of closure. One of the worst disasters of all would be the closing of so many important repositories of local heritage.    Conclusion     During the process of research, interviews, tours, observation, and general discussion, it became increasingly clear that the existing disaster planning literature, while invaluable in many cases, is inadequate in a number ways. Very little information is available on recovery of audiovisual materials and area-wide disasters are not addressed in detail. As this experience has shown, even the collecting institutions may not have the means to even contact experts in the aftermath of a catastrophe (when communications systems are down), much less to send damaged artifacts to conservation facilities. And in many countries, these services are not available. Having practical, relevant recovery information for all materials, especially audiovisual, would allow institutions to write procedures they can use into their disaster plans, or at least keep this information on hand so it will be available in the event of an emergency.      Another glaring problem is that the available resources are primarily marketed to libraries, museums, and archives. Of course, such institutions are the recognized guardians of cultural heritage, and they should have as much access to preservation literature as possible. However, artists, musicians, private collectors, and average individuals also have priceless artifacts that are even more easily damaged in disasters such as Katrina. These people also need to know how to care for and recover their collections, and their options should be more than \"call a conservator\" or \"send it to a lab.\"       In the audiovisual world, very few individuals even know whom to contact in the event of an emergency, much less where to find information on DIY recovery. Although many of the specialists in this field are working to make a profit, it can't hurt to share knowledge with those that can't afford their services anyway. Expertise must be contributed to the larger public so that under-funded individuals and institutions can recover damaged media in the best manner possible, and not put materials at greater risk by mishandling. There are efforts being made to improve this situation, yet there is still much more work to be done, and it must be done pro-actively, not as a reaction to unsettling events.             For collecting institutions, more structural work must be done to protect collections before, during, and after a disaster. The first line of defense against deterioration and disasters is proper storage, yet achieving the ideal storage conditions is often impossible. Current recommendations for climate control of audiovisual and other materials involve a costly dependence on constant cooling or freezing and dehumidification. Not only is this not affordable for many archives but when these systems fail, as we've seen can happen even for those more wealthy institutions, the results can be potentially devastating. Much more research must be done on passive climate control systems and buildings that will protect collections, not put them in more danger.      Similarly, disaster planning needs to be revamped so institutions will understand its importance. Right now, the body of literature available makes the process feel very sterile. By attempting to address all types of disasters in all regions, the planning guides spread themselves quite thin. By the same token, their broad and standardized approach may allow collecting institutions to feel that a disaster plan can be created in a systematic way. Clearly, plans that were created in this manner failed in a disaster the size of Katrina. This experience has highlighted the need for regional planning resources directed at collecting institutions, which speak to local geographic bodies, climates, and concerns. Such resources might make planning more attractive, since the institution won't have to wade through the vast amount of information that doesn't apply to them, and because they will address specific, familiar concerns. Katrina has also drawn attention to the fact that a disaster plan is not a written document as much as it is an awareness of how the institution will handle an emergency.

By Alex Cotton     Originally published in citylimits.org , November, 2008           Until now, the phrase digital divide has been used to describe the difference between those with home computers and easy access to the Internet and those without. But what about people without television? As the major broadcasters switch from using analog to digital signals this February, activists warn the digital divide may take on a new meaning, leaving thousands of New York Citys most vulnerable with blank TVs.    Several digital developments have evolved in recent months to spell change for peoples relationship with their gadgets. Looming large among them is the February 17 deadline, required by law, for all major television networks to broadcast in digital only. In addition to providing sharper images and better sound, the use of digital signals will free up segments of the airwaves for other uses, such as broadband Internet (see below for more on this). However, anyone with an analog television who uses rabbit-ears or a rooftop antenna rather than a pay service like cable (see specifications in detail here), will find themselves staring at a screen full of snow. Nationwide roughly 21 million people rely on analog televisions, a group that disproportionately includes the poor, minorities, senior citizens and the disabled.    The federal government has taken steps to address this potential problem. In addition to launching an education campaign, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) a bureau of the U.S. Dept. of Commerce has made coupons available for purchasing converter boxes that allow analog televisions to receive digital signals. City agencies have joined the education effort, whether including notices in public housing newsletters or ensuring that electronics stores notify their customers that analog televisions will soon require converters to work properly.    Activists, however, are concerned that the message will not be heard by all who need it. According to Mark Lloyd, a vice president at the D.C. -based Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the $5 million made available by congress for the NTIA to conduct consumer education was far too little. Both the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and NTIA, Lloyd said, have done a good job of communicating with vulnerable populations, whether these are the elderly, disabled, immigrants, or people working two jobs, with the money they have. But they have not been given enough for this very complicated transition, he said. According to a recent Nielsen report, nearly 4 percent of New York City households are completely unready for the transition.    Thomas Kamber, executive director of Older Adults Technology Services, is also concerned that New Yorks seniors may be missing the message. TV is more than entertainment when youre 75 or 80, he said. For isolated, low-income seniors, TV provides the sounds of a voice and images that carry them through the day. If it goes dark, that will be a real blow. He also points out that TV is an important source of information for many seniors, and that according to a New York Academy of Medicine report, lack of access to information is one of the top problems facing New Yorks elderly. Back in May, Kambers organization led one information session about the digital transition at a Staten Island senior center, but was unable to hold additional sessions when 80 percent of OATS City Council funding was cut over the summer.    Jimmy Flynn, a salesman at a Flatbush P.C. Richards &amp; Son, which sells televisions and other electronics, has noticed that some of his elderly customers dont grasp how the digital transition could affect them. He counsels people to buy digital televisions, but has sold a few analogs to seniors over the past year when they didnt follow his advice. Some older folks dont understand the new process, he said.    Putting the web into &#8220;white spaces&#8221;    Earlier this month the five-member FCC voted unanimously to open up unused portions of the television spectrum, or white spaces, for public use. The availability of these white spaces, according to wireless experts, could make broadband Internet i.e. the fast kind cheaper and more widely available within a few years, and help to bridge the digital divide.    Television spectrum including white spaces has been largely controlled by major television broadcasters, with white spaces serving as buffers between channels to prevent interference. With the switch from analog to digital broadcasting coming early next year, however, the FCC has decided that the buffers are no longer necessary. On Nov. 4, the FCC voted unanimously to free them up.    White spaces have the potential to connect tens of millions of Americans now off the grid, either because they dont have the necessary infrastructure in their area or they cant afford it, said Timothy Karr, campaign director at the national media reform organization Free Press. He pointed out that in New York City, white spaces account for one-fifth of the public airwaves.    Although no Internet devices on the market make use of white spaces, technology companies from Motorola to Google are lined up to create a new generation of hand-held, wireless devices able to access the Internet wherever public airwaves are available (which means pretty much everywhere). Current wireless devices, on the other hand, such as Apple iPhones, rely on already existing proprietary networks like AT &amp;T or SprintNextel to connect to the Internet, rather than the new spectrum that will be opened up by white spaces. Were talking about a platform for innovation, said Joshua Breitbart, policy director for Peoples Production House, a local media education and activism group. He said that such devices would make access to the Internet cheaper, since a wireless infrastructure is relatively low cost. Internet prices are currently inflated due to a lack of competition, Breitbart said: Broadband access is now a duopoly locally, comprised of Time Warner Cable and Verizon DSL in some areas of the city, and Verizon and Cablevision in others.    Breitbart also argues that mobile, cell phone-like white space Internet devices could go a long way toward connecting more minorities to the web. Citing research by the Pew Internet and American Life Project, he points out that when it comes to who is using cell phones, the technology divide is much less pronounced. It appears that Latinos and African-Americans may be more likely to access the Internet through new portable devices than using currently available technologies. People want access to the Internet through mobile devices, he said. Its a more meaningful alternative for a lot of people.    Everyones not as excited as Breitbart, however. Lobbying groups such as the North American Broadcasters Association (NABA) asked the FCC to carry out more testing before its decision, raising concerns that public usage of white spaces could cause interference with television signals, and other devices including wireless microphones. There are transition issues people will have to deal with, said Dave Baylor, Secretary General of NABA, referring to the digital television transition, and we believe adding any other variable to the pot at this point is a real issue.    The City Council also passed a resolution expressing its concern that white space devices could interfere with wireless microphone users, such as Broadway shows, which depend on the same portion of the spectrum. But digital media activists remain confident that in a few years, white space devices will provide the public with an effective and inexpensive way to access the Internet. The key is to take advantage, says Breitbart: The oil of the information world &#8230; is sitting on the surface.    Decreasing the divide    Even if New Yorkers have to cool their heels until white space devices are available, some public housing residents will receive a technology upgrade sooner. Over the next three years, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) will build 15 new computer labs at public housing complexes, and offer a variety of job training and computer literacy classes to go along with them.    The project was made possible by a $600,000 grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and will be carried out in partnership with City College of New York (CCNY). A third of the money will be used to build or update existing computer labs, while the rest will be used by CCNY to develop a curriculum and hire instructors. The classes offered will range from GED preparation and job training to Internet literacy. Were making strides towards bridging the digital divide, said Ukah Busgith, deputy director at NYCHA s Department of Administration.    Its a promising development, said Mary McCormick, president of the Fund for the City of New York, an organization that develops policy and technology solutions for government and non-profits. But unless we implement it really well, in four years, they may be replacing the labs again, without much to show for it. McCormick points out that in the past there have been major investments in computer hardware for the underserved without the necessary computer education or maintenance.    The consequences of the digital divide are profound, McCormick said. The people who suffer most are young people. There is no way to prepare for a successful adulthood if you grow up without computers.    Currently, NYCHA runs 94 computer labs in its 343 housing developments. Five of the new or updated computer labs will open in February, with 10 more to follow over the next two years. The classes will be available for anyone age 13 or older, and NYCHA plans to provide instruction to 720 residents over the course of the project.    Reshaping local radio    As digital media access activists honed in on the Internet and television, a storm has come and gone in the world of radio. A new system for measuring radio stations popularity developed by the radio ratings leader, Arbitron, was recently unveiled in New York and seven other cities. It led to an outcry from minority-owned and -focused radio stations, which claim that their ratings were unfairly lowered by the new system possibly threatening their very existence.    Akin to Nielsens ratings of television show viewership, Arbitron has long used a diary system to provide similar ratings for radio programs. The ratings are then used to determine the cost of advertising on any given radio station. However, Arbitron recently replaced the diary system in which members of the public report their radio listening habits with the Portable People Meter (PPM), a small electronic device that automatically records whatever radio stations are playing in its vicinity. (So you could be listening to WBLS at home, but on a trip to the bodega the PPM also records K-Rock playing in the store.) Our goal with the commercialization of the PPM is to help radio remain competitive in an increasingly challenging media marketplace, Arbitron CEO Steve Morris said in a release.    The PPM system went into effect in New York City in October, and caused a drop-off in ratings for many Spanish language radio stations. If you compare the diary ratings in the spring to PPM ratings this month, the fall-off in ratings is as high as 60 to 70 percent in certain Spanish language radio stations and day parts, said Frank Flores, vice president and market manager for Spanish Broadcasting System New York, adding that such ratings dives could force some stations out of business because of lower ad revenue. Spanish Broadcasting System, which owns or operates 21 radio stations nationally, has refused to negotiate with advertisers based on the new numbers, claiming they are inaccurate. The dramatic and drastic fall in ratings seems to happen in large part only to black and Hispanic stations, said Flores.    Flores and others argue that the error is caused not by the new technology itself, but by the new sampling system Arbitron has adopted, which they believe undercounts minorities. Flores says that with the diary system, the zip codes of the individuals who recorded their radio habits were released, and he could verify that an appropriate number were drawn from high density black and Hispanic areas. With the new system, however, Arbitron has refused to release zip code information as a measure to prevent tampering with their samples. In the meantime, Flores has asked Arbitron to revise its new sampling system by taking into account factors such as listeners&#8217; country of origin and other variables to guarantee that a proper number and variety of Latinos are sampled, arguing that this will make data more representative. But he has yet to see any changes. Their timetable for addressing these concerns is six months to a year, but the problem is immediate, he said. Arbitron maintains that it exceeded its sample target of blacks by 13 percent and of Hispanics by 23 percent.    The City Council took a position on this media matter, too, recently passing a resolution calling on the FCC to investigate the PPM system. The new Arbitron system, which has been used in other states, already caused major changes in the ratings of stations, said Councilman Leroy Comrie, chairman of the Consumer Affairs Committee, referring to the effects that PPM already has demonstrated in Philadelphia and Texas. Additionally, a lawsuit against Arbitron has been launched by the New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for false advertising and deceptive business practices surrounding its PPM system.    Although Arbitron has been willing to meet with the City Council, Comrie remains frustrated that they have not taken any action to address his concerns, and worries about the consequences of decreasing revenue for minority radio stations. We are fighting to maintain local cultural influence over news and music, he said. Its important that we not wind up only having superstations.

As we have heard from the other speakers here today, certain themes, such as the effectiveness of disaster plans, success and failure with external recovery services, the fate of private collection, and the risk of cultural collapse, continually repeat themselves. It is crucial that we understand the weight of these issues, and bear them in mind for future disaster planning and recovery efforts.    In February and March of this year I spent about 2 weeks in New Orleans, talking with staff at libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions, as well as individual artists, about their personal and professional experiences dealing with Katrina. My goal was to gather information to supplement the existing literature on disaster preparedness and recovery, with emphasis on collections with audiovisual media. The constraints on underfunded and underdeveloped communities were always kept in mind. What follows will be a summary of the lessons I learned from New Orleans.                 Lesson #1: Effectiveness of Disaster Plans    When I began research in New Orleans, I didn't realize the extent of the inadequacies of disaster preparedness plans. Aside from outlining the usual hurricane preparation procedures that people in the Gulf Coast are used to, the plans were basically useless. One of the biggest lessons learned by everyone in the area is that you can't prepare for everything.     Most institutions had been through a number of hurricane preparations before, and were used to the drill of boarding windows, unplugging electrical equipment, moving collections away from windows and off floors. However, most agreed that plans simply did not address a disaster of this scale. Traditional disaster planning literature assumes that the event is localized, that is, confined to the building itself, not the entire area. When area-wide disasters are addressed, they still presume that staff will be able to re-enter the building within a reasonable amount of time. But could there possibly be a written document that provides instructions on coping with the total infrastructure collapse of a city? Of course the answer is no.     Indeed, you can't prepare for everything, nor should the planning process attempt to. When planning for disasters, the point is not to attempt to predict every possible situation. Disaster preparedness guidebooks appear to presume this is achievable by outlining endless scenarios that one might encounter. Instead, the approach should be to equip the building, collections, and staff with the appropriate tools to deal with disasters. Rather than conceiving of a disaster plan as a document, that almost all people will ignore once it is created, it must be a way of thinking. Emergency response should not be numerical lists on paper. Rather, it should be, and will be most effective if it becomes an instinctual reaction, for this is how people will inevitably deal with an emergency. The planning process should involve increasing staff awareness of what external recovery services would be used in an emergency (for audiovisual media this could probably be a lab that the institution works with regularly), what collections have priority, where emergency supplies are kept, and where to find communications information in an instant. Thus, the only reason one would need to turn to the written document is to find telephone numbers and possibly salvage procedures for specific media. It should not be something that has to be read at the time of a disaster; this simply will not work.      One word that has been repeated by everyone is communication. Lack of thorough contact information for personnel was possibly the #1 cited problem with disaster plans. While it is very difficult to cope with loss of power, cell phone towers, and landlines, many people feel that disaster plans could have incorporated better alternative communication venues (such as web-based email Yahoo, Google). We've heard this already today, yet it is worth repeating here to emphasize the magnitude of this issue. When planning for emergencies, don't neglect to establish every possible line of communication between staff members. This is the crux of good disaster planning.     Lesson #2: External Recovery Resources    Building alliances with sister institutions was recognized by many people to have been a savior. Others found that professional recovery services could deal with the problem efficiently. Yet a number of institutions are finding that the service contracted by high-level administration was inadequate for the collections needs. This issue goes highlights the necessity of integrating the collection's disaster plan with the larger institution's plan. Always be sure that your library, archive, or department within a larger organization has discussed emergency preparedness plans with the administration.     The most effective way to ensure that these measures will be successful is to establish them in advance. Collection managers that had discussed external assistance before Katrina with upper administration found that they were happy with the results. Those that did not articulate the specialized needs of library and archival materials to the decision making bodies that were forced to make decisions for the entire organization (such as university or government institutions), were sometimes stuck with contractors that didn't take proper care to protect artifacts. Even though these services are meant to help, they can sometimes do more damage than good. A few institutions feel that the rebuilding efforts of some contractors will not be adequate to protect the collections in the future.      On the reverse side, there is also the issue of assisting other institutions. Louisiana State University and the Archives of the Diocese of Baton Rouge (which some of you may have heard from yesterday) provided a lot of assistance to damaged institutions, and did their best to utilize their disaster plan to help others in this case. The massive cleaning and drying effort that took place at these institutions were an incredible boon to some of the collecting institutions of the Gulf Coast. Fortunately, they were prepared to take on this endeavor. When negotiating reciprocal recovery assistance with other institutions, be sure that you have the training, staff, and space to take on large collection damage. As Diocese of BR Archivist Emilie Leumans pointed out yesterday, update disaster plans to include information on taking in evacuated collections and staff.     Lesson # 3: Unfortunate fate of private collections     Katrina caused undoubtedly catastrophic damage to New Orleans rich cultural heritage. Worst hit was not the collecting institutions; rather, it was private collectors, artists and musicians whose collections suffered the most. Well-known local musicians including Fats Domino and Danny Barker lost nearly all of their personal memorabilia. The simple fact is that individuals were more vulnerable than institutions, whose mission is specifically to safeguard cultural materials, and whose staff are trained to handle damaged artifacts.      As an example of, I'd like to talk about the story of Helen Hill, a local experimental filmmaker and animator, whose home was badly flooded. Helen, her husband Paul, and their son Francis, are temporarily living in Columbia, SC. Although I don't have time to go intotheir incrediblestory in detail, I'd like to talk a moment about Helen's experience with recovering her films.                         Helen and Paul were able to return to New Orleans about a month after the flood to gather anything that remained of their home. Her films, which are mainly 16mm and Super 8mm shorts and home movies, both color and black and white, had been kept at home, where she found them with varying degrees of damage. Some had stayed dry, others had been submerged and become mold infested. A few months after settling in in Columbia, Helen decided to send her films to a lab to have them cleaned. Being an experimental filmmaker who has worked extensively with manipulated and damaged film that she either found or distorted herself, she knew that even with damage to the images she would be able to find a use for them in future films.          Unfortunately, Bono Film and Video Lab in Arlington, Virginia, rejected the films for cleaning, saying they were beyond recovery.                 Determined not to completely lose her work, Hill decided to clean the films herself. After a struggle to find any information online about film cleaning, Helen eventually learned about a product called FilmRenew, sold by Urbanski Film. She learned the proper method for using the cleaner, and in the basement, set up rewinds on a dining table that she bought at a garage sale and went to work. Her process has involved soaking the films in FilmRenew for different lengths of time, then wiping them with old cotton rags as they are run through the rewinds.           Although most of the films suffered irreversible damage, the cleaning process has been relatively successful. Helen has had some of the cleaned films reprinted on an optical printer, and has shown them at symposiums and festivals around the country. Still, the original unique surfaces that Helen had created using hand processing, and tinting and toning are lost. Worse still, what remains of the irreplaceable home movies are forever scarred with the patterns left by mold and water.              The good news is that Helen will be able to track down some of the prints and negatives of her original short films around North America. Following this step, Hill plans on storing the remaining titles at a film collective in Canada. She feels that in addition to providing distribution services, the collective will be better equipped to protect the films from disasters. Her hope is that the collective is better prepared to safeguard films than she is at home, and at least if the power fails in Canada, the heat and humidity are less likely to be a threat.      There have always been tensions between artists/private collectors and collecting institutions. Creators often feel that their original works belong with them at home. Collectors don't want to put their amassed materials in a place where they will not be able to access items at will. However, following Katrina, many of these people are beginning to reconsider. Individuals whose homes and belongings were damaged immediately turned to archives with the hope that their staff might be able to save what remained. The Danny Barker collection could have found a home before Katrina, had the estate not prioritized financial compensation over preservation. What people seem to have realized since the disaster is that though it may appear that such collections should have high monetary value, they are worth nothing if they don't exist.            It would be a stretch to argue that all collections should be donated to an institution. Museums, libraries, and archives are often under-funded and under-staffed. Yet their entire responsibility is to ensure the preservation of cultural heritage, a task which most people do not have time to do all alone. Katrina has made a clear case for individuals to reconsider who may be the best caretaker of their collection. Even Helen Hill, a young filmmaker whose body of work is still growing, feels that donating prints to a collective will at least provide backup in case of another emergency.           Lesson #3: Risk of cultural Collapse     The loss of cultural collections brings to light an even greater potential loss that the city of New Orleans is facing: the loss of their unique culture. Residents are leaving the city and settling elsewhere for lack of housing. David Freedman, general manager of WWOZ, New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Radio Station (which lost its home, and came within inches of losing 1500 hours of original recordings), put it very bluntly in our conversation in March: if people do not return, if the infrastructure of the city is not rebuilt soon enough to attract old residents, the cultural production of the city may be idle. A number of current and former residents that I have spoken with expressed the same fears.      Freedman described to me an inimitable city, one where the local musicians had a unique way of working together and exchanging ideas. The local music scene had a very distinct flavor: Cajun and Creole rhythms blended with Jazz and Blues, the sounds of Rock-n-Roll mingled with Mardi Gras Indian chants, and Brazilian and Caribbean influences weaved into all styles.       The rhythms and styles unique to New Orleans are not written in music textbooks. They cannot be learned from reading sheet music. Generation after generation, the city's musicians have learned their art through two venues: church gospel choirs and high school marching bands. Renowned nationwide, New Orleans high school marching bands are the highlight of all Mardi Gras parades. Through their music instructors, who learned from their band instructors, young musicians gain an irreplaceable set of knowledge. This they carry through their musical career, building and expanding it, then passing it along to the next generation.      With the flood and total infrastructure collapse of the city that followed, schools closed, churches were destroyed, and entire communities disappeared. As the beginning of the Spring 2006 semester, 20 public schools were open in Orleans Parish, educating approximately 15,000 students, down from nearly 60,000. Although the New Orleans public school system was one of the lowest performing in the country before Katrina, there was still strength in musical traditions. According to Freedman, who is on the local Music Education Commission, the city's schools are now under tremendous pressure to perform well academically. If a school does not receive a 50% passing grade, it will be shut down. Sadly, music and arts are not part of the evaluation, and have been cut from the curriculum so students can focus entirely on academics. Without the curriculum, the teachers, and the students, development in New Orleans music is at a total standstill.      Reductions in the overall population reflect the trend of smaller staff sizes at various cultural institutions in the city. The reductions in staff size and funding for both recovery and day-to-day operations are possibly even larger a threat to many institutions and collections than the hurricane itself. So many institutions and businesses that have re-opened are facing the danger of closure. One of the worst disasters of all would be the closing of so many important repositories of local heritage.    Conclusion     During the process of research, interviews, tours, observation, and general discussion, it became increasingly clear that the existing disaster planning literature, while invaluable in many cases, is inadequate in a number ways. Very little information is available on recovery of audiovisual materials and area-wide disasters are not addressed in detail. As this experience has shown, even the collecting institutions may not have the means to even contact experts in the aftermath of a catastrophe (when communications systems are down), much less to send damaged artifacts to conservation facilities. And in many countries, these services are not available. Having practical, relevant recovery information for all materials, especially audiovisual, would allow institutions to write procedures they can use into their disaster plans, or at least keep this information on hand so it will be available in the event of an emergency.      Another glaring problem is that the available resources are primarily marketed to libraries, museums, and archives. Of course, such institutions are the recognized guardians of cultural heritage, and they should have as much access to preservation literature as possible. However, artists, musicians, private collectors, and average individuals also have priceless artifacts that are even more easily damaged in disasters such as Katrina. These people also need to know how to care for and recover their collections, and their options should be more than \"call a conservator\" or \"send it to a lab.\"       In the audiovisual world, very few individuals even know whom to contact in the event of an emergency, much less where to find information on DIY recovery. Although many of the specialists in this field are working to make a profit, it can't hurt to share knowledge with those that can't afford their services anyway. Expertise must be contributed to the larger public so that under-funded individuals and institutions can recover damaged media in the best manner possible, and not put materials at greater risk by mishandling. There are efforts being made to improve this situation, yet there is still much more work to be done, and it must be done pro-actively, not as a reaction to unsettling events.             For collecting institutions, more structural work must be done to protect collections before, during, and after a disaster. The first line of defense against deterioration and disasters is proper storage, yet achieving the ideal storage conditions is often impossible. Current recommendations for climate control of audiovisual and other materials involve a costly dependence on constant cooling or freezing and dehumidification. Not only is this not affordable for many archives but when these systems fail, as we've seen can happen even for those more wealthy institutions, the results can be potentially devastating. Much more research must be done on passive climate control systems and buildings that will protect collections, not put them in more danger.      Similarly, disaster planning needs to be revamped so institutions will understand its importance. Right now, the body of literature available makes the process feel very sterile. By attempting to address all types of disasters in all regions, the planning guides spread themselves quite thin. By the same token, their broad and standardized approach may allow collecting institutions to feel that a disaster plan can be created in a systematic way. Clearly, plans that were created in this manner failed in a disaster the size of Katrina. This experience has highlighted the need for regional planning resources directed at collecting institutions, which speak to local geographic bodies, climates, and concerns. Such resources might make planning more attractive, since the institution won't have to wade through the vast amount of information that doesn't apply to them, and because they will address specific, familiar concerns. Katrina has also drawn attention to the fact that a disaster plan is not a written document as much as it is an awareness of how the institution will handle an emergency.

As borders between media shift, contemporary sculpture and installation work may include new uses of video, ceramics, architecture, fabric, drawing, or performance, as well as classic skills such as woodworking, welding, or moldmaking.    The sculpture facility covers a full floor of the Barney building. It is divided into a wood and metal shop which includes a panel saw, Sawstop table saw, compound miter saw, vertical and horizontal bandsaws for both metal/woodworking, an air compressor system and downdraft table for sanding. In addition, we have a 800 sq/ft critique space for the presentation of student art work, as well as a plaster and moldmaking studio with a self contained spray booth room. Shop technicians are available for information and oversight of the studio. The sculpture faculty includes Area Director Sue De Beer, Beverly Semmes, Rico Gatson, Curtis Mitchell, Dave Hardy, Ian Cooper, and other innovative practitioners.    Craft Sculpture: Ceramics, Metalsmithing, Fabric, and Glass    The renewed connection between fine arts and craft media has become the focus of a new cross-disciplinary movement in contemporary art. Courses in ceramics, mixed media sculpture, metalsmithing, jewelry, and sewn fabrics allow artists to expand their ideas and practices through a wide range of materials and skills in the Art Department&rsquo;s studio facilities. Through a unique liaison with Urban Glass, the largest facility in the world dedicated to glass as an art form, students can expand their creative vocabulary in this medium, as well.

HD projection and HD television allow instructors and students to share, explore and adapt to the rapid cultural and technological innovation the world faces today.    Painting and Drawing    The skills of painting and drawing enable the artist-student to transform ideas, be they internal or external, to the planarity of a piece of paper or canvas. This process of converting thoughts and signs into visually accessible shapes is complex and, at times, very direct. For this reason, painting and drawing will always be considered by many to be at the heart and soul of the visual arts.    The recent resurgence of interest in traditional hand made media speaks to many issues in contemporary life, and the demand for courses in these areas is higher than ever. Our painting and drawing faculty, led by Area Director Maureen Gallace, with the support of John Torreano, Jesse Bransford, Ross Bleckner, Peter Rostovsky, and Jason Tomme reflects the broad range of acclaimed artists working in classical materials.    Print    Print provides contemporary artists with a extensive array of possibilities and working methods, from photocopy to etching to digital 3-D printing, from unique to multiple to installation. The NYU Print Studio is dedicated to an environment where this range is encouraged along with experimentation and personal exploration.    The print studio, with 14' high ceilings and northern light, is equipped to realize ideas in multiple techniques, including silkscreen (photo-process darkroom), etching (two Charles Brand etching presses), relief print, book arts and letterpress (Vandercook UNI-1 press), digital imaging/printing (Epson 4900 Archival Printer, Epson scanner, AccuRIP software, Xante PostScript large formate laser printer), as well as Departmental facilities for laser cutting and 3-D printing. New York City at large provides a unique context for the study of print, which includes numerous special print exhibitions, vast museum collections, the annual New York City Print Week, and a vibrant diy, zine, and street art scene. The print area faculty, led by Area Head Mark Johnson, includes Kiki Smith, Valerie Hammond, Noah Breuer, and Ruby Sky Stiler.    Environmental Activism    Faculty member Natalie Jeremijenko, one of the most visible and dynamic forces working at the intersection of art, technology, engineering, and environmental studies, has established the Environmental Health Clinic, a laboratory to diagnose environmental ills and create prescriptions for a greener tomorrow. Working with designers, gardeners, and computer scientists, Jeremikenko, who is herself an engineer as well as an artist, is establishing a cross-disciplinary team of artists and researchers to contribute to a slate of poetic and political project                        This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
