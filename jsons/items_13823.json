Yet the details of that period remain hazy to us. President Franklin Roosevelt spoke of \"the forgotten man,\" and this period is also forgotten in our national memory. This course has two aims. The first is to refamiliarize us with America's worst crisis - the downturn that lasted a full decade, the unemployment that ranged high into the twenties, the devastating deflation, the financial whirlwind in which banks failed and so many homes were lost. The second is to show how the events of that period, both disaster and rescue, continue to affect aspects of economic life in the current day. The New Deal inspired, but it also set the trend that led to the prohibitive modern entitlements - Medicare Part D -- that so darken the nation's fiscal future. The memory of Depression-time monetary errors - national leaders mistook deflation for inflation - may be causing today's authorities to err in the opposite direction. The commitment of Presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin Roosevelt to strengthening homeownership led them to create institutions that were important to America's postwar stability. But today the descendants of those institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, may also be contribution to market vulnerability. Students will emerge from this course with a number of reference points that enable them to evaluate political and economic changes today.

It examines political, cultural, and economic similarities and differences of successful wealth-creating societies, paying special attention to impacts of government, entrepreneurship, management, and financial institutions. The objectives of the course are to develop an understanding of different enterprise systems and to hone abilities to think comparatively, both over time and across national contexts.

Special attention is given to the impacts of government,entrepreneurship, management, and financial institutions. The histories of such diverse countries as India, Russia, China, the Asian \"Dragons,\" Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Chile and the European Union will be examined as well as their implications for global business and investment prospects.

Focusing on the entrepreneurial forces that shaped the rise and evolution of the modern economy and business system, the course takes into account business strategy and structure, finance, management, labor organization, technology, transportation, communications, and public policy. Discusses the broader economic, cultural, and political constraints within which American enterprise has been shaped. The goals are to impart a long-term perspective from which contemporary business can be understood and to introduce students to historical ways of thinking about economic development.

Understanding this crisis and the responses of central banks and other authorities will help business decision-makers and investors assess financial opportunities and risks in normal times. This course examines lessons from the crisis as viewed by a market practitioner. International comparisons during the current crisis will be used to illuminate key issues. Comparison and contrast with past crises and policy actions also will play an important role. Along the way, key concepts like information asymmetries and asset bubbles will be explored. The course will be conducted using a combination of lecture, discussion, and case analysis. The teaching style will be socratic, so active class participation will be key. When appropriate, an experienced market practitioner or policymaker will be invited to join in the discussion. Although formal prerequisites have not been listed, success in this course requires prior (undergraduate or graduate) coursework in intermediate macroeconomics (equivalent to B01.2303 The Global Economy) or in money and banking. Enrolling without such experience would be ill-advised.

It will adopt a broader approach to the relationship between the economy and markets, and its connection with the current financial crisis will be only tangential. The approach to the subject will primarily consist of a more pragmatic, \"real-world\" framework that focuses on the dynamics and \"noisy\" realities that often drive financial market behavior in the short-run. A basic analytical framework discussing those relationships will also be presented in a limited fashion. Special emphasis will be given to the bi-directional nature of the relationship between macro economic activity and the markets, as well as to the destabilizing effect that the behavior of the latter can have on the economy. The inquiry will be global in its scope, particularly in regards to the commodities and foreign exchange markets, but will also have an unmistakable focus on the U.S. economy. An additional angle to be explored is the interaction among various markets themselves, the most infamous being the bonds/stocks relationship and reasons for which their presumed antagonistic dynamic can often break down.

Starting from an analysis of social networks, we develop a general theory of platform competition, where the platform may be a network such as Facebook but can also be an operating system such as the iOS, Android, or Windows. We start by asking why Facebook, Tweeter and LinkedIn are successful while, for example, MySpace is unsuccessful. We examine how networks are formed from the perspective/incentives of users, the network (platform) operator, and the applications providers that are complementary to the network. We identify key features of networks including: (i) higher value to users from networks of larger size; (ii) very significant inequalities in market share, profits, and (often) prices; (iii) the extent of incentives for interoperability and interconnection between networks; and (iv) importance of key network nodes that are \"central\" or \"influential\" in the creation and stability of networks. Using the main lessons from social networks, we discuss two-sided markets, where two sides/parties wish to interact, and their interactions must go through an intermediary/platform/network. Examples: Two sides: advertisers and readers. Intermediary: periodical, Yellow Pages, Internet search engine. Two sides: Internet message sender and receiver. Intermediary: Internet Service Provider(s). Two sides: consumers and merchants. Intermediary: payment network (e.g., Visa). Two sides: gamers and game designers. Intermediary: game-console manufacturer. We observe that sometimes both sides pay (game-console manufacturers charge both gamers and game designers), sometimes there is a zero price to one side (Google doesn't charge consumers but charges advertisers) and sometimes one side is subsidized (credit-card companies charge merchants, but often subsidize consumers with cash and bonus points or miles). We explain why charges vary across the types of examples above, and apply it to the current controversial issue the abolition of \"network neutrality,\" if telephone and cable companies are allowed to charge originators of content on the Internet.  We will discuss other network platforms of importance including (i) mobile \"smart\" phones such as iPhone and Android ones; (ii) audio and video distribution networks; (iii) digital books distribution networks; (iv) the PC operating systems market; and (v) the payments systems networks (credit cards) platforms. We will also discuss in detail the structure of the Internet, the Internet search and advertising markets/platforms and network neutrality.

How are these kinds of growth rates possible? What are the structural, economic, political and policy underpinnings? What accounts for the absence of growth in a substantial part of the developing world? Attention will be given to the evolving global landscape surrounding this growth. What is the impact of this widening pattern of growth? Are there natural brakes that may slow the process down or make it difficult for the non-G20 developing countries and their 1/3 of the world's population to start or sustain high growth? The class will attempt to identify and assess the impact of important global trends and challenges. Included in the latter will be governance issues. We will spend a little time on the impact of the 2008-2009 crisis, the transmission channels and lessons learned from the vantage point of developing countries.

Traditional financial instruments are ultimately judged by their bottom line: the financial returns they produce. This course examines financial instruments designed to produce not only financial returns, but also social returns; these instruments are commonly known as \"double bottom line\" investments. Such financial instruments exist on a spectrum from grants-where no financial return is contemplated-to market or near-market rate investments that have positive social impact. In between are program-related investments, community development venture capital investments, and socially motivated loans. Special purpose financial institutions called community development financial institutions have emerged that use a range of investments to achieve social goals; the course will examine the structures and social missions of these institutions. It will also look at the role of various actors, such as foundations and government, in fostering such activity. In addition, the course will consider the challenges of measuring and quantifying social returns produced by double bottom line investments.

In addition to honing their analytical skills, by organizing all activities related to institutional asset management, students gain experience in financial writing and oral presentations, advancing financial decisions in a group setting, and handling all of the governance and fiduciary responsibilities of a university endowment fund. The central mission of this course is for students to learn through having practical, hands-on investment management experience. Because of the time requirements in formulating an investment strategy, screening and reviewing prospective stocks, updating the status and performance of existing positions, and all of the ancillary duties connected with the operation of a real, live portfolio, the experiential or hands-on component consumes the bulk of class time. However, a related mission is for students to acquire knowledge about institutional funds management and current industry practices and trends. This more traditional learning experience comes through readings and presentations from industry professionals. The endowment funds under management operate as the Michael Price Student Investment Fund (MPSIF). The Fund began in early 2000 thanks to a generous gift from Michael F. Price. During its short life, MPSIF has been a very popular course that helps Stern students to differentiate themselves by providing valuable experience for careers in asset management and related fields.

DBi courses are offered in either a one (1.5 credits) or two-week (3 credits) intensive format over the traditional break periods (Winter, Spring and after May graduation). Designed as a total immersion or \"mini-study abroad\" course, classes are taught in English at foreign locations by the local faculty of Stern's international partner schools. Courses include guest speakers, corporate visits and local cultural excursions. Students gain a new world perspective on business within the context of a different culture, as well as valuable insight into the U.S. model of business. Lessons learned on these courses can be applied immediately to the student's business education and workplace at home. In addition to Stern tuition, a DBi Program Fee is required and covers the costs of housing, excursions and some meals (detailed in the individual course syllabi.) Credits earned may be applied to the Global Business specialization. The DBi Program Fee is $2200 for all 3 credit courses and $1300 for 1.5 credit.

DBi courses are offered in either a one (1.5 credits) or two-week (3 credits) intensive format over the traditional break periods (Winter, Spring and after May graduation). Designed as a total immersion or \"mini-study abroad\" course, classes are taught in English at foreign locations by the local faculty of Stern's international partner schools. Courses include guest speakers, corporate visits and local cultural excursions. Students gain a new world perspective on business within the context of a different culture, as well as valuable insight into the U.S. model of business. Lessons learned on these courses can be applied immediately to the student's business education and workplace at home.

This course covers the issues and concepts in developing data-driven Web sites. Students evaluate a variety of different Web development approaches and architectures, including the common gateway interface model, Java, Active Server Pages, Dot Net, and Web Services. A variety of alternative development approaches are compared, looking at issues such as the development environment and the security, performance, scalability, and maintainability of systems developed with the different approaches. The class is divided into student teams. Each team implements a small system using one of the supported technologies and evaluates their experience. Students should have the ability to build a simple Web page and be proficient with common Microsoft office business applications, especially ACCESS. There is light programming, which is used as an example of how to build dynamic Web pages for B2C and B2B sites. Assignments include both Active Server Pages as well as J2EE. Unix, Windows 2000, and Linux platforms are available to host projects.

This course teaches students how modern financial markets function as a network of systems and information flows, and how to use information technology for decision making in trading and managing customer relationships. Information systems serve two purposes in the financial industry. First, they facilitate markets and their supporting services such as payment, settlement, authentication, and representation. Second, they facilitate or engage in making decisions such as when and how much to invest in various instruments and markets. The first part of the course describes how systems facilitate various kinds of payment and settlement mechanisms, enable financial markets such as exchanges and ECNs, and support inter-institution communication. The second part of the course describes how traders, analysts, and risk managers use systems to cope with the vast amounts of data on the economy, markets, and customers that flow into their systems each day. It covers automated trading systems and other types of customer-oriented analytic systems that are becoming increasingly intelligent in how they make or support decisions. The course features a mix of case studies, Excel-based illustrations and assignments, and the latest industry tools. It is particularly suited for finance and marketing students interested in understanding information technologies in financial services from a practical career standpoint.

Banks, securities dealers, asset managers, insurance companies, and firms with significant financing operations all require real-time, enterprise-wide risk management systems for handling market, credit, and operational risk. Such systems establish standards for aggregating disparate information, including positions and market data and operational risk, calculating consistent risk measures, and creating timely reporting tools. This course is directed toward both finance and technology oriented students who are interested in understanding how large-scale risk systems need to be evaluated, acquired, architected, and managed. It identifies the business and technical issues, regulatory requirements, and techniques to measure and report risk across an organization or market.

For each of these technologies, it provides an overview of the space corresponding to this class, examines who the major players are, and how they use these technologies. Students then study the underlying technologies; examine the business problems to which they can be applied; and discuss how these problems are solved. Key companies in the spaces created by these technologies are also studied: what these companies do; which technologies they use; how these technologies support their critical applications; and how these companies compete and collaborate among themselves. Moreover, the course examines possible future directions and trends for the technologies being studied; novel applications that they enable; and how high-tech companies can leverage applications of these technologies. This is an advanced course, and it is intended for the students who have already acquired basic knowledge of technical concepts and who want to advance their knowledge of technologies beyond the basics and to further develop an understanding of the dynamics of the spaces associated with these technologies.

Frameworks (1.5)                       This seminar is designed to be a provocative exploration of normative differences. Its premise is that the aspiring leader of a global enterprise - whether business or political or educational - must confront, understand, and where possible reconcile the ethical and cultural complexities and tensions at work in the world. Its objective is to bring students to a heightened, more nuanced understanding of the interplay of global forces and local norms. This seminar draws upon academic research, trade books, press readings, and case studies. To bring these issues to life, the course will also present an array of guest speakers, all of whom have been actors in this global process, each with a particular expertise. In class discussion and lectures, and through questions and answers with the visitors, students will develop an appreciation for the intricacies of operating in the heterogeneous global environment, recognizing the unique elements of national character, government structures, and local normative frameworks. This seminar will benefit from the insights of Maria Bartiromo (CNBC Anchor and author) and Tim Collins (CEO Ripplewood Holdings), who will be present in each session to share insights with seminar visitors. The seminar will comprise six evening sessions, from 6:00-9:00, spread across the entire Fall Term 2010, with exact dates determined in part by the constraints of guest speakers. To encourage a diverse set of viewpoints and permit intensive engagement with guest speakers, target enrollment is roughly 20 students drawn from across the graduate schools of NYU.

All too often, managers and corporate boards fail to recognize factors that threaten the firm's business until its very survival is in doubt. In such cases, Management may need to implement drastic and sudden changes in several aspects of the firm. The course draws on several of the core disciplines in the MBA program, and provides an opportunity to apply them to organizations in the midst of major transitions. Students should come into this course ready to apply both quantitative and qualitative tools drawn from accounting, corporate finance, cash flow modeling, debt restructuring, negotiation, marketing, management, leadership and communication. The perspective is from the office of the CEO. Financial, market, and organizational aspects of transformation will be explored through case studies, articles, texts and class discussion. The course is relevant for students who anticipate working in any operating company or in a firm advising and/or interacting with such a company- including consultants, turnaround specialists, venture capital and private equity professionals, and bankers.

Current practices are unsatisfying to almost all involved in managing, growing, or funding nonprofit organizations. But rising in importance are promising experiments, new thinking, and established practices which share the stated aim of delivering funds efficiently to organizations that are able to make the greatest social impact. There are increased efforts to arrive at common metrics against which nonprofits can benchmark their results, and in turn, organizations are adopting more sophisticated management techniques to gauge their own progress. New fundraising strategies focused on raising equity capital are gaining traction funders are beginning to address their own contributions to inefficient practices and, new intermediary organizations modeled on investment institutions are emerging to facilitate the allocation of dollars to best-in-class organizations. To support large-scale operations, nonprofits are developing earned income streams, and there is a rising interest in the potential of government to partner in new ways with social entrepreneurs so that public resources can be coupled with accountability for demonstrable results. Over the course of the semester, well examine the challenges inherent to a functioning nonprofit capital market through the lens of practitioners. We will invite guest speakers to discuss their experiences, describe how they navigate the nonprofit capital market, and share their perspective on emerging trends.

Being able to communicate effectively is a vital component to many aspects of business life. This course emphasizes both a strategic and practical approach to provide you with a set of frameworks that will help you construct effective email correspondence, documents and presentations which inform, persuade and influence your audience. The Management Communication course offers you the opportunity to speak and write in a managerial context while receiving personalized feedback and coaching to help develop and sharpen these critical skills.

Leaders must also be persuasive and credible communicators. This course, designed for students who are experienced communicators, is built on the concept of a \"career life cycle\" which blends theoretical models for effective persuasion with practical communications strategies in a simulated business setting. The \"life cycle\" encompasses a number of individual and group situations that an employee will face during the course of their career. In developing communication strategies we will examine factors impacting a person's career life cycle such as personal goals, business stresses, corporate situations and environmental events that must be considered to be persuasive and credible in a given situation. Exercises focus on communicating to potential audiences of internal and external parties including colleagues, senior management, clients, competitors and potential business partners. Written and spoken communication assignments range from informative to persuasive in a variety of simulated settings. Situations engage hypothetical audiences involving external \"industry experts\" that range from receptive to challenging. Strategies and lessons learned in this highly participatory course can be put into action immediately in a student's daily business and personal environment. Students benefit from individual feedback on all written work as well as individual and team coaching based on video recorded reviews of each presentation.

The goal of this course is to teach students the fundamentals of managing collaboration and conflict in one-on-one and small group settings. Our objective is to enhance students' interpersonal skills at their jobs. Drawing from the latest findings in managerial psychology, we cover the fundamentals of effective negotiation, communication, and persuasion. Special topics include getting buy-in, coping with resistance, and building coalitions.

Most key corporate deals- such as mergers, financings, international joint ventures and settlements- are legal/business problems. So it's crucial for lawyers and business people to know how to work well together, and how to design wise agreements. To develop these skills, students negotiate a variety of simulated transactions and conflicts. They take one deal from concept to term sheet to contract and then see its effects months later. They grapple with whether to sue or settle. They even trade roles at least once. They also examine real agreements, perhaps meeting and questioning guest speakers who actually negotiated them. They also discover ways to design better transactions, with the help of economics and other important theoretical tools. Through their continuing work together, they overcome their natural feelings of professional culture shock and learn how to work as a team to create sound agreements- as their future employers expect them to do.  A basic course on negotiation, such as Collaboration, Conflict&amp;Negotiation (B65.2159) or Lawyering (L06.2001) is a prerequisite for the course. The course is different from Stern's Advanced Topics in Negotiation, which focuses mainly on negotiating in organizations. Neither is a pre-requisite for the other. *Special Note for Law Students: Law students may elect to do one additional written project for the course, and will have one extra short session with the professor to introduce the project. The session is scheduled for 6-8 pm Thursday, October 26, the week before the course begins. While the course will end December 18, there is no final and assignments are scheduled to give law students time to prepare for other final exams. Students tend to fill the course quickly.

Given the number and scale of recent board-related scandals, it also examines the factors in board form and function that lead to failures in corporate governance. Students learn primarily through the analysis of actual cases, and the class sessions are discussion-based with some lecture. Students prepare case analyses for class, some written, some oral, and perform an in-depth term project where one board of directors, or one particular board function, is analyzed in some depth. Several visitors from industry are brought to class to share their perspectives and experiences at appropriate times in the term. Modules of the course are designed to address specific governance issues, such as board composition and independence; the nomination process; audit and compensation committees and their functions; proxy processes and shareholder resolutions; tenders and takeovers; and legal compliance. As an integrative M.B.A. course, this course designed to be taken after the student has a fundamental understanding of issues in management, strategy, professional responsibility, and how firms interact in the marketplace. Prior coursework in these areas is strongly recommended.

ALD requires personal curiosity and reflection from students and personal openness and sharing in the class discussions, leadership discussion groups, and one-on-one sessions with the professor. Leadership development concepts used in this course will be immediately useful for students and applicable for the rest of their lives.

Yet today, biotechnology refers to an industry, with the top companies in the sector exceeding some of the major pharmaceutical companies in market capitalization. No longer are biotechnology companies constrained to using recombinant DNA technology alone, as the moniker is assigned today to any small company engaged in any life sciences-related research directed toward developing a commercial product, using any scientific means. Belonging to the sector usually also implies a culture - small, nimble, visionary but practical, cash constrained but willing to risk it all. While some of the above characteristics are more idealized than real, it is certainly the case that, while the key factors for success in a development stage company include the very same scientific, analytic, and/or managerial talents that reside in \"big pharma\", the context is different, requiring the organization to incorporate some additional skills to ensure survival, and non-traditional systems to support success. The foundation of this course will be the core curriculum that you have all mastered during your first year at Stern. You will be at an advantage, in that regard, relative to some of your future colleagues who work in the industry today. The long product development cycles inherent to the industry may minimize the rigor behind decision-making, since there is a long time lag between the action taken, and its ultimate impact. Moreover, paradoxically, there is a \"comfort\" to operating at a significant loss for many years, spending hundreds of millions of dollars of investors' money, relieving the incentive to generate incremental revenue or savings that seem insignificant relative to the scale of the investment and the size of the opportunity. Finally, the need to constantly raise money sometimes favors promotion over analysis, and short-term impact on share price, rather than long-term creation of value.

It concentrates on building the company issues rather than start-up issues, although some cases and lectures explore start-up as well. Included are studies of family businesses that have acute growth issues because of succession and family dynamics. It is designed for students interested in understanding the opportunities and problems involved in the management or operation of their own business; and it is also aimed at students considering employment in a small or midsized firm. The differences between small firms and large organizations, management needs, practices, and financial resources are examined.

As you rise in your career, you will need multiple and often conflicting constituencies on board to follow your vision. But if you don't lead, others will not follow. This course will help you toward honing some of the essential self-reflective skills you need to give form and substance to such vision. It will also be of value to those who wish to have a broad intellectual understanding of the context of leading and the content of leadership.

Through an innovative partnership with firms located in India, Stern students will have the opportunity to apply their classroom learnings to real-world issues by conducting fieldwork abroad. Team-based projects will focus on areas including poverty alleviation, energy, health and sustainability. Students will gain exposure to various organizations' models for addressing these issues, as well as to thoroughly-vetted international social enterprises that are making tangible and potentially scalable progress in serving the world's poorest populations. Student teams will work with partner organizations to deliver on discrete projects designed to meet existing needs. In addition, project deliverables will facilitate the sharing of knowledge and best practices with the growing social impact sector.

This course offers perspectives and frameworks that seek to understand technological innovation and NPD at different levels of analysis, including the firm, industry, and national levels. It addresses issues pertaining to the discovery, development, and diffusion of technological advances. For example, we attempt to understand the innovation process in both start-up and established firms, and when established firms have an easier (or more difficult) time bringing a new product to market and appropriating profits from it. We also provide frameworks for assessing new technological and business opportunities. Students are expected to analyze and evaluate technological opportunities using the frameworks and techniques presented in the course. Most students who take the course have career interests in consulting (operations or management), general management, entrepreneurship, technology/new media, or marketing, but students from all disciplines are welcome.

It analyzes the sources, distribution, and use of influence in relation to resource allocation, organizational change and performance, management succession, procedural justice, policy formulation, and social movements within organizations. It develops skills in diagnosing and using power and politics in organizational settings. A basic assumption underlying the course is that managers need well-developed skills in acquiring and exercising power to be effective. The course is designed to (1) improve students' capacity to diagnose organizational issues in terms of their political dimensions and (2) enhance their effectiveness in their jobs and careers as a result of that improved capacity.

We will use the consultative selling model to understand the process of selling, discovery of and alignment with customer's needs, presentations of solutions, overcoming objections, and gaining agreement. Rather than pigeonholing selling as \"something done by those sales types\", we look at it as providing solutions to customer's problems. Selling is unique in that everyone does it. In business, we sell our products, proposals, IPOs, projects, budgets, and anything else that someone else has to approve. In life, we buy cars and houses (buying and selling are two sides of the same coin), interview for jobs, propose marriage, and many other things that someone else has to say OK to. In short, selling is a fundamental life skill. The course is primarily an interactive discussion including debates, case discussions, and many small group, \"skills drills\" to apply the concepts and methods. In addition to learning the aspects of contemporary selling as it applies to their chosen careers, students will also gain a better appreciation of this important - and often misunderstood - aspect of an organization. The course is focused on professional, business-to-business (B2B) sales issues and sales management. We frequently draw on our own experiences as consumers (B2C) as a basis for developing perspectives, insights, and understanding of B2B sales themes.

Increasingly, brands are being managed as conversations and personifications that transcend the features and functions they offer. Social media creates two way brand channels, where the brand can speak, listen, and respond - and where people are speaking to each other about the brand outside of the brand's control. This course is intended to equip marketing students to lead brands in a social media world and to contribute and even run cross&amp;#8208functional social media teams in a marketing world that is moving from brands broadcasting a message to brands listening and then engaging with people.

It is critical for students to understand this landscape and be able to incorporate it into marketing and business strategy. This course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to learn about some of the most important marketing practices that are used today such as: Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM), Social Marketing, Behavioral targeting, Advertising Exchanges, Ad Networks and more. One main component of this course is guest speakers, who include key leaders of many of today's most progressive media companies. They will talk about how they started their companies, how the idea was created, how they got funding, the marketing challenges they faced, and ultimately how the company morphed over time towards success or failure. Students should already have some familiarity with digital advertising / marketing and the goal is to bring a strong sense of real world views into the marketing decisions of the most interesting digital media companies of today. The course will be centered on preparing students to create their own digital marketing company which will be their final project. For this project, groups of 5-6 students will work together. During each class we will review the main components of the project, provide reviews and ideas for research. The students will have the chance at the end of the semester to pitch their digital business concept to one of the top VC's in the country. This real world experience will add a special dimension to the class. The class is taught by Greg Coleman who is currently president of Criteo. He has held executive positions within many of the world's most influential technology companies. He was formerly the president and chief revenue officer at the Huffington Post and the EVP of global sales at Yahoo. He also served as President of Platform-A at AOL from February to April of 2009.

However, innovation is risky and most new products fail in the marketplace. Thus, expertise in the design and marketing of new products is a critical skill for all managers, inside and outside of the marketing department. In this course, we first focus on the tools and techniques associated with analyzing market opportunities and then focus on designing, testing, and introducing new products and services. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches are covered. In particular, the course covers the new product development process, market entry strategies, how to generate new product ideas, mapping customer perceptions, segmentation, product positioning, forecasting market demand, product design, and advertising and product testing. It emphasizes how to incorporate customers and competitors into all of these aspects of new product development. In contrast, a related course Technological Innovation and New Product Development, B65.3356, emphasizes organizational issues associated with new product development.

One can argue that innovation, and a culture that inspires and supports innovation, is the only sustainable competitive advantage. A frequent manifestation of recent innovation has been breakthrough design. Design represents a powerful alternative to the dominant management approaches of the last few decades and is an important perspective for leadership to embrace                  Course Description                                                Section         Meeting Times         Dates         Instructor         Notes                                                                                                      10    R      6:00 pm        - 9:00 pm               09/22-12/22         Williams,L                                                                          Pre/Co-requisite  Equivalencies   Specialization             Pre/Corequisite                       Co-requisite -         COR1-GB.2310 ( B01.2310 ) - Marketing                                           Equivalencies           MKTG-GB.2171 ( B70.2171 ) - INNOVATION & DESIGN                      Specializations           Entrepreneurship&amp;Innovation           Marketing           Luxury Marketing           Product Management                                                            BACK TO TOP                                                                    MKTG-GB.2385        International Marketing Management (3)                       Examines the development of international marketing programs, from determining objectives and evaluating international market opportunities through coordinating strategies in world markets.

Typically, logistics-related costs account for 20 to 25 percent of firms' total costs. On the revenue side, the supply chain decisions have a direct impact on market penetration and customer service. With the globalization of the economy and advances in information technology, supply chain design and coordination have become important tools for gaining competitive advantage. Therefore, the objectives of the course are to (1) develop an understanding of individual components of the supply chain (such as order management, transportation, network design, distribution channel management, after-sales service, and customer service strategy) and their interrelationships with other functions of firms, such as marketing, manufacturing, and accounting; (2) impart analytical and problem-solving skills necessary to develop solutions for a variety of logistics problems; (3) understand the complexity of interfirm and intrafirm coordination in implementing programs such as \"quick response\" and \"vendor-managed inventories\" and (4) develop the ability to design logistics systems and formulate integrated supply chain strategy, so that all components are not only internally synchronized but also tuned to fit corporate strategy, competitive realities, and market needs.

Behind the glitter and excitement in Las Vegas are industries dedicated to supplying entertainment to customers. Operations address the supply side of business, including how products are produced and how services are supplied. This course goes behind the scenes in Las Vegas to observe and analyze the operations involved in performing this supply function. This course presents an opportunity to observe and study the entertainment industry including strategy formation and decision-making that are quite unique. The entertainment comes in various forms. The underlying driver is certainly gaming, but the industries surrounding the various forms of gambling have become major profit centers separate from the millions made on the casino floors. During a one-week visit to Las Vegas, students will observe and study some of the major operating industries that comprise the broad scope of entertainment in this city. Although the Operations Management models, techniques and strategies in this field are applicable anywhere, Las Vegas is the epicenter of the industry.

It is directed to students interested in real estate development from the point of view of three classes of investors: * an entrepreneurial investor, looking to buy a coop, condo or small property for individual use or rental, * a working general partner of a small group of investors, who will actually manage and-or be responsible for overseeing the property after purchase, * a passive outside investor, who may be searching for an investment that is limited in liability to the original investment. In real estate development, operating decisions will determine whether or not a deal will be successful and meet overall financial goals. Although most students will not work full-time in the real estate industry, property investments will arise as opportunities to increase passive income and wealth. Understanding how these deals are created and managed will allow investors to choose deals with the highest probability of success. The real estate topics discussed in the course will include all types of development: residential, hotel, office, retail, land and industrial properties. In addition to case studies, class lectures and discussions, some outstanding entrepreneurial developers will be invited as guest speakers to reinforce the ideas taught in class. The class will include a real estate development project, with group presentations to the class, and potential outside investors.

The objective is to focus attention on some unique aspects of service businesses and relate these aspects to service operations and strategy. For example, some of the issues this course covers include the following: *What impact does intangibility have on corporate and business strategy and operations in service businesses? *What is the impact of simultaneous production and consumption of services on how service delivery systems are designed and managed? *What impact do customers have on service quality and productivity of service firms? *What unique organizational designs are needed to manage a service business? Consistent with the need to emphasize an integrative multidisciplinary perspective on service operations and strategy, students are asked to undertake a project assignment to design a complete service business, starting from idea to incorporation.

Second, through case analyses, it provides the student with a chance to exercise his or her own ethical judgment in business situations. The overall goal is to help the student to realize that ethical assumptions, choices, and conflicts are inherent in virtually all business decisions, and to develop a greater understanding of the manager's professional responsibilities. All sections of the course use the same book of readings and cases, and all will. cover the same set of essential topics, including fiduciary responsibilities, product liability, ethical issues in the workplace (such as preferential hiring, sexual harassment, drug testing, or whistle blowing) and ethical conflicts in international business. Yet, by the instructor's selection of specific cases or readings, each section of the course will differ slightly in emphasis. Course instructors come from every department in the Stern School and reflect a broad range of interests and orientation. For each session, students will be required to study readings, either essays in business ethics or judicial opinions, and to prepare one or more cases for analysis in class. Class discussion is an essential part of the course. Students will explore in actual business contexts the fundamental concepts that underlie professional responsibility. In order to bring different perspectives to the classroom, each section of the course will host at least one outside speaker during the term. Professional Responsibility is a second year core course and part of the capstone program. Every student in the course should have a working knowledge of economics and the various functional areas of business, and this knowledge should be applied to the cases, readings, and class discussions. Students should complete or place out of all of the first-year core courses prior- to enrolling.

The course gives a mix of practical data analysis along with an introduction to the relevant theory. The ARIMA models are used to forecast series like interest spreads, while ARCH models are used in estimating and forecasting the volatility of series like stock returns and exchange rate returns. Students analyze data sets of their own choice in projects. Additional topics of interest covered in the course are methods of testing for nonstationary (Dickey-Fuller tests) as well as models for capturing seasonality as seen, for example, in series of monthly sales figures. The low-cost forecasting method of exponential smoothing is discussed, and its connection to the RiskMetricsTM methods of J. P. Morgan and GARCH models is explored. If time permits, we also study methods of forecasting multivariate time series, where information from several series is pooled to forecast a single series. The concept of co-integration or co-movement of multivariate series is discussed (interest rates being a prime example), along with their implications for forecasts. Other potential topics in the course include the use of ARCH models in value at risk (VAR) analysis and in option pricing.

We shall discuss the concept of martingales and risk-neutral probability measures, and derive the general pricing formula for contingent claims. We shall study the binomial model and derive the price of a European call option on this model, called the binomial Black-Scholes (BS) formula. We study put options using the put-call parity. We shall compare the binomial BS formula to the continuous time BS formula, and analyze the latter via the \"Greeks\". We shall also look at exotic options such as the lookback and the knockout option. Additionally, American options, forward and future contracts, and fixed income models will be included as well.

The course places emphasis on \"probabilistic thinking and \" and on learning how to model the real-life phenomena, which evolve over time. It presents classes of stochastic processes which are widely used as modeling tools in diverse fields of applications including finance, economics, accounting, marketing and actuarial science. It covers basic theory and applications of discrete and continuous- time Markov chains; discrete and continuous time martingales; and Brownian motion and its generalizations. The introduction to Ito stochastic calculus is presented with a view towards financial applications. The course also discusses some statistical aspects of considered processes.
