Transferable credits may come from prior institutions, CLEP or AP exams, or other approved sources. Meeting eligibility requirements for the CCTOP Scholarship does not guarantee admission.           Planning for Success (Pre-Admission Advising)   At McGhee, we encourage you to plan ahead by sending us a copy of your unofficial transcript/s, (if you have transcripts from more than one school, please send all of them) so that we can evaluate the courses you've already completed and for which you have earned credit.

The CCTOP scholarship is set to meet 50 percent of a student's financial need up to $7,500. The financial need is determined after accounting for the FAFSA expected family contribution from the estimated cost of attendance and all federal aid has been applied.   Students who receive this scholarship may also qualify for additional forms of financial aid. Since the amount of the scholarship award is based upon your financial need, filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is an important part of the process. Additional forms of financial aid also are available.     Eligibility for all of these financial aid opportunities is based upon the FAFSA information you provide, so be sure to file ! Students must file the FAFSA form every year. For returning students, the deadline is March 1 every year. Students who are applying to the NYU School of Professional Studies, should complete the form and include NYU as a receiving school (code 002785) as early in the process as they can, to ensure that their aid is processed as quickly as possible.   NYU is a participant in the Yellow Ribbon Program for post-9/11 veterans, in addition to offering other education-related G.I. Bill benefits.   Please Note : Students who are awarded the CCTOP scholarship are expected to maintain a 3.0 GPA throughout their enrollment at the NYU School of Professional Studies in order to retain the award.         CCTOP Partnership Schools   The following community colleges are partner schools in the Community College Transfer Opportunity Program. Students not attending one of these schools are not eligible for the award currently. NYU accepts transfer students from two- and four-year schools all over the world, and students from non-partner schools are more than welcome to apply to the University. While the CCTOP program is unable to expand to additional schools at this time, we are happy to answer questions about our programs and admissions process from students who are interested in transferring from non-partner schools, or from the faculty and administration who work with them.

This scholarship and advisement program is designed to help qualified community college students transfer to the Paul McGhee Division.   McGhee is known for providing a supportive learning environment in which personal, professional, and academic growth is encouraged. Seamless credit transfer, multiple financial aid and scholarship options, and flexible schedules that allow students to continue to earn while they learn, make McGhee the ideal choice for those students who are considering transferring to a four-year college or university.   Comprehensive academic and career counseling, programs taught by top professionals in their fields, and the option to study full-time, part-time, online, and on-site, make McGhee a viable option for students who seek a rich educational experience from a world renowned university, but who need to fulfill other personal and professional obligations while they study.         Eligibility Requirements   You may be considered for the CCTOP scholarship if you meet the following criteria.     Be a community college student who has completed a year of full-time study or who has earned 30 consecutive credits at a partner school   Be nominated by a member of the faculty or administration at your community college   Have earned a minimum 3.5 cumulative GPA at the community college   Have earned a minimum of 48 transferable credits towards a McGhee program of study   Complete the undergraduate admissions process , by February 1 for the fall semester and by November 1 for the spring semester; be offered admission to the NYU School of Professional Studies Paul McGhee Division; and enroll in one of its programs of study   Be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and eligible to complete the FAFSA form           CCTOP Application Process     Be nominated by a faculty member or administrator at your community college to be considered for the scholarship. Ideally, this is early in the semester before you'd like to attend.   Prepare and submit your admissions application .   File your FAFSA .     Important Details   Nominations by faculty members or administrators at your community college must be submitted online. Qualified students may be nominated by a dean, faculty member, transfer counselor, or academic advisor at their community college. The CCTOP nomination is a separate process from the letters of recommendation required for the admissions application. As soon as your college professor or administrator submits the CCTOP nomination, you will receive an e-mail from us with links to the online undergraduate application page.   Transferable credits may come from prior institutions, CLEP or AP exams, or other approved sources. Meeting eligibility requirements for the CCTOP Scholarship does not guarantee admission.           Planning for Success (Pre-Admission Advising)   At McGhee, we encourage you to plan ahead by sending us a copy of your unofficial transcript/s, (if you have transcripts from more than one school, please send all of them) so that we can evaluate the courses you've already completed and for which you have earned credit. Our advisors can help you to choose courses for the remainder of your program of study at the community college, taking into consideration the major you intend to pursue at McGhee. The McGhee Division allows the transfer of a maximum of 64 credits. With proper planning and communications, we can help to ensure that you complete your McGhee degree in the most timely and cost-efficient manner.   Please send unofficial transcripts to:   Teresa Gargiulo  Director of Advising  McGhee Division   E-mail : cctop.mcghee@nyu.edu   Fax : (212) 995-4666          Scholarship Details   Your grades may qualify you to be a recipient of a McGhee CCTOP scholarship. The CCTOP scholarship is set to meet 50 percent of a student's financial need up to $7,500. The financial need is determined after accounting for the FAFSA expected family contribution from the estimated cost of attendance and all federal aid has been applied.   Students who receive this scholarship may also qualify for additional forms of financial aid. Since the amount of the scholarship award is based upon your financial need, filing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is an important part of the process. Additional forms of financial aid also are available.     Eligibility for all of these financial aid opportunities is based upon the FAFSA information you provide, so be sure to file ! Students must file the FAFSA form every year. For returning students, the deadline is March 1 every year. Students who are applying to the NYU School of Professional Studies, should complete the form and include NYU as a receiving school (code 002785) as early in the process as they can, to ensure that their aid is processed as quickly as possible.   NYU is a participant in the Yellow Ribbon Program for post-9/11 veterans, in addition to offering other education-related G.I. Bill benefits.   Please Note : Students who are awarded the CCTOP scholarship are expected to maintain a 3.0 GPA throughout their enrollment at the NYU School of Professional Studies in order to retain the award.         CCTOP Partnership Schools   The following community colleges are partner schools in the Community College Transfer Opportunity Program. Students not attending one of these schools are not eligible for the award currently. NYU accepts transfer students from two- and four-year schools all over the world, and students from non-partner schools are more than welcome to apply to the University. While the CCTOP program is unable to expand to additional schools at this time, we are happy to answer questions about our programs and admissions process from students who are interested in transferring from non-partner schools, or from the faculty and administration who work with them.
