Students taking classes with the many members of our permanent faculty, they will also find that some professors hold more than one appointment at the University, crossing from the Law School to the Graduate School of Arts and Science and beyond.   Faculty Director   Lewis A. Kornhauser   Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law   An expert in microeconomics, Lewis Kornhauser approaches legal analysis by imagining a \"very simple world.\" In his article, \"An Economic Perspective on Stare Decisis,\" he describes this \"simple\" approach: The world has a single judge, named Liza. She faces a dilemma. A very strange judicial practice called \"precedent\" dictates that she must adhere to her own holding in a prior case even though she now thinks she decided it wrongly.   In analyzing her dilemma, Kornhauser first explores the reasons why Liza now thinks the decision is wrong. For each reason, how desirable or undesirable would it be for Liza to stick with the wrong holding? Then, Kornhauser adds a layer of complexity by imagining the existence of other judges besides Liza, and separately examining each possible combination of judges and reasons.

NYU School of Law pioneered the colloquium model\u2014designed to engage scholars and students in the highest level of discussion in legal theory\u2014with colloquia in Legal History and Legal, Political, and Social Philosophy. Our colloquia now range widely over different areas of legal theory, such as constitutional theory and the economic analysis of law, and in all these areas our professors are producing trailblazing scholarship. We took this leadership role a step further, with the creation of the first graduate degree in legal theory.   At NYU we construe \"legal theory\" broadly to include scholarly reflection on domestic and international law and legal institutions that draws on philosophy, economic theory, psychology, anthropology, political theory, critical race theory, feminist theory, history and sociology. NYU has long been a leader in interdisciplinary legal theory, with special strengths in philosophical, economic and sociological approaches, as well as legal history. The program is for a select group of highly motivated students who wish to take full advantage of our unrivaled faculty resources in the area in order to establish a firm foundation for future scholarly or professional pursuits. This full-time program is especially suitable for those planning a career in legal academia and is open to students with a law degree from countries around the world.   Legal Theory Thesis Seminar   All students are required to write a substantial thesis in conjunction with the year-long Legal Theory Thesis Seminar , designed specifically for students in the program. The seminar integrates instruction on a variety of methodological approaches with assistance in choosing and refining the research project. It also offers students an opportunity to receive critical feedback on thesis drafts from both the instructor and other students in a workshop format. Guest lectures will supplement instruction during the early weeks of the Fall semester to ensure breadth of theoretical and methodological instruction. The Spring semester will be devoted primarily to the workshopping of draft theses.   An Interdisciplinary Education: Centers and Institutes   An interdisciplinary study of law involves integrating methodologies and perspectives from several disciplines to gain a multidimensional understanding of legal problems. The Law School is home to 29 interdisciplinary centers and institutes in which faculty and students collaborate on timely, often policy-pushing projects. As example, in just 15 years the Brennan Center for Justice has become one of the nation\u2019s preeminent legal institutions, promoting a nonpartisan agenda of research, public advocacy and legal action in its four issue areas: democracy, poverty, criminal justice and liberty and national security.

The Office of Career Services assists students with their job search process, offering services and training to prepare them for entry into positions in the private law market. A key part of this process is the annual International Student Interview Program , designed to bring students together with employers from around the globe.   The Public Interest Law Center is the focal point for public service at the Law School. Those who have an interest in pursuing positions in government, NGOs, international organizations, or other public interest employment attend the Public Interest Legal Career Fair , the largest of its kind in the nation.

Students taking classes with the many members of our permanent faculty, they will also find that some professors hold more than one appointment at the University, crossing from the Law School to the Graduate School of Arts and Science and beyond.   Faculty Director   Lewis A. Kornhauser   Frank Henry Sommer Professor of Law   An expert in microeconomics, Lewis Kornhauser approaches legal analysis by imagining a \"very simple world.\" In his article, \"An Economic Perspective on Stare Decisis,\" he describes this \"simple\" approach: The world has a single judge, named Liza. She faces a dilemma. A very strange judicial practice called \"precedent\" dictates that she must adhere to her own holding in a prior case even though she now thinks she decided it wrongly.   In analyzing her dilemma, Kornhauser first explores the reasons why Liza now thinks the decision is wrong. For each reason, how desirable or undesirable would it be for Liza to stick with the wrong holding? Then, Kornhauser adds a layer of complexity by imagining the existence of other judges besides Liza, and separately examining each possible combination of judges and reasons.

NYU School of Law pioneered the colloquium model\u2014designed to engage scholars and students in the highest level of discussion in legal theory\u2014with colloquia in Legal History and Legal, Political, and Social Philosophy. Our colloquia now range widely over different areas of legal theory, such as constitutional theory and the economic analysis of law, and in all these areas our professors are producing trailblazing scholarship. We took this leadership role a step further, with the creation of the first graduate degree in legal theory.   At NYU we construe \"legal theory\" broadly to include scholarly reflection on domestic and international law and legal institutions that draws on philosophy, economic theory, psychology, anthropology, political theory, critical race theory, feminist theory, history and sociology. NYU has long been a leader in interdisciplinary legal theory, with special strengths in philosophical, economic and sociological approaches, as well as legal history. The program is for a select group of highly motivated students who wish to take full advantage of our unrivaled faculty resources in the area in order to establish a firm foundation for future scholarly or professional pursuits. This full-time program is especially suitable for those planning a career in legal academia and is open to students with a law degree from countries around the world.   Legal Theory Thesis Seminar   All students are required to write a substantial thesis in conjunction with the year-long Legal Theory Thesis Seminar , designed specifically for students in the program. The seminar integrates instruction on a variety of methodological approaches with assistance in choosing and refining the research project. It also offers students an opportunity to receive critical feedback on thesis drafts from both the instructor and other students in a workshop format. Guest lectures will supplement instruction during the early weeks of the Fall semester to ensure breadth of theoretical and methodological instruction. The Spring semester will be devoted primarily to the workshopping of draft theses.   An Interdisciplinary Education: Centers and Institutes   An interdisciplinary study of law involves integrating methodologies and perspectives from several disciplines to gain a multidimensional understanding of legal problems. The Law School is home to 29 interdisciplinary centers and institutes in which faculty and students collaborate on timely, often policy-pushing projects. As example, in just 15 years the Brennan Center for Justice has become one of the nation\u2019s preeminent legal institutions, promoting a nonpartisan agenda of research, public advocacy and legal action in its four issue areas: democracy, poverty, criminal justice and liberty and national security.

The Office of Career Services assists students with their job search process, offering services and training to prepare them for entry into positions in the private law market. A key part of this process is the annual International Student Interview Program , designed to bring students together with employers from around the globe.   The Public Interest Law Center is the focal point for public service at the Law School. Those who have an interest in pursuing positions in government, NGOs, international organizations, or other public interest employment attend the Public Interest Legal Career Fair , the largest of its kind in the nation. They may also apply for post-graduation funding from the Law School to pursue short-term fellowships, clerkships and internships worldwide through the following programs:     International Law and Human Rights Fellowship Program   International Court of Justice Clerkship   International Law &amp; Development Fellowship Programs                                           Facebook   Twitter   YouTube   Instagram   Visitor Information   Directories   Offices and Departments   Site Map   NYU School of Law                   Prospective Info   Admissions (JD) Admissions (LLM/JSD) Areas of Study Degrees Offered Faculty Profiles Campus Map  Academics   Academic Sitemap Course Descriptions Class Schedules NYU Classes Clinics Academic Calendars  Departments   Academic Services Career Services Financial Aid Graduate Affairs (LLM) Hospitality and Events Housing Human Resources Library Operations and Facilities Records and Registration Student Affairs  Tools and Resources   About the Law School Campus Map Directories Law School News Journals Picture Book                      \u00a9 2015 New York University School of Law. 40 Washington Sq.
