Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates. This class will offer a historical and cultural background related to the development of legal structures and substantive rules in both territories. Students will study existing judicial systems, and essential rules dealing with legal education and practice in U.S. and Emirates.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

POLSC-AD 152X Comparative Politics of the Middle East                                                                                         A focus on the &quot;Arab Middle East&quot; presupposes that regional culture is a significant factor in explaining political outcomes in the region. For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

VISAR-AD 103X Introduction to Visual Culture                                                                                         Visual Culture Studies branches away from the traditional preoccupations of Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 131X A &amp; E ll: Contemporary Debates about the Middle East and Islamic World                                                        It is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration to suggest that there exists no other region or cultural grouping in the world today that has undergone such intense scrutiny as that of Middle East and Islamic world. With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

Arab Crossroads Major                       Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                                          Arab Crossroads Concentration                       This multidisciplinary concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

In recent years, Arabic language students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

The transformation of poetic form and the emergence of modern genres, such as drama, the novel, and the short story, will be examined in relation to classical Arabic and European genres. We will also discuss the relationship between aesthetic developments and their historical, political, and intellectual contexts.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life.

But in the Middle East states and national cultures are at the same time ancient and recently created. Here the complex processes of state-formation are still current, and the United Arab Emirates, which is barely forty years old, serves a rich and richly varied example for the comparative understanding of state-building, cultural imagination, and economic development.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

Arab Crossroads Major                       Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                                          Arab Crossroads Concentration                       This multidisciplinary concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

In recent years, Arabic language students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

major in Film and New Media emphasizes interdisciplinary and global approaches to film and new media. Students develop critical and interpretive skills for making and understanding documentary, experimental, narrative, and interactive styles of film and new media and learn the methods and theoretical models for analyzing film, new media and their histories. The six electives classes can be taken from any area in the curriculum, but students should work with an advisor in the Film and New Media program to plan a sequence to support a particular interest. Only one course may double-count for the major in Film and New Media and another major or concentration.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

This course analyzes and puts into practice principles of different forms of dramatic and dynamic writing: classical, episodic, and parametric in narrative and documentary; rhythmic and contrapuntal in experimental film; episodes and attractions for web platforms; interactive and auto-generative in new media. Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

FILMM-AD 116J Single Shot Cinema                                             In this hands-on course, we explore the vocabulary of camera movement and the dramatic impact of the long, single take. Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting                                                                              Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor&rsquo;s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning psychology into behavior. Students explore acting fundamentals, such as investing yourself in the moment, genuinely listening, personalizing fictional material; and playing objectives are initially explored via games, improvisations, and exercises, followed by partnered scene work, ensemble technique, and solo performance.

THEAT-AD 115 Directing the Actor                                                                                         A course for theater directors, filmmakers, actors, and visual artists. Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711&ndash;1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.

ACS-AD 232X Society and Politics of Saudi Arabia                                                                              This course is an introduction to the study of Saudi Arabia and can be taken as a gateway course to the Arab Crossroads concentration. Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

ACS-AD 233X War and Media in the Middle East                                                                                                    This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

ACS-AD 263J Modern Architecture in Abu Dhabi                                                                                                    This course is an exploration of modern architecture in the city. Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

COREP-AD 01W Culture and Difference :1001 Nights                                                                   This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

By examining pre-cinematic artistic practices, aesthetic traditions, cinematic styles, political economies of media, and social change, the course provides a context for understanding productions from major industries in Cairo, Chennai, and Mumbai alongside work by independent filmmakers and new media collectives from throughout the regions. Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women&rsquo;s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

The basic spread of subjects treated is poetry and prose narrative; but there will be a nuancing of literary genres and categories (especially of those peculiar to the Arabic tradition). Students will be introduced to main approaches to the study of this broad and deep literary tradition. Texts will include selections from: Pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluke period. Prose literature will include The Qur&#39;an; Hadith; Apocrypha of the Prophets; Picaresque Maqamahs; the Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life.

The first section of the course provides a philosophical foundation for debates about women, work, and difference based on feminist theories. In particular, we will explore postcolonial perspectives on feminism and difference, feminist Marxist critiques of capitalism, and feminist Islamist critiques of modernity. The second part of the course provides an overview of how women in the Gulf feature in contemporary discourses as participants in &ldquo;globally competitive&rdquo; economies, mothers of &ldquo;future generations of citizens&rdquo;, and symbols of &ldquo;tradition and culture&rdquo;. The third part of the course provides an overview of the public policy and legal frameworks shaping women&rsquo;s work. In particular, this section of the course explores how different categories of &ldquo;women&rdquo; are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers involved in policies shaping women&rsquo;s work experiences in the Gulf.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

Students cap their language achievement by accessing and studying such genres as literature, song, film, folklore, etc., in the original language. The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.

In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course will invite students to explore the legal systems of other than their own native legal system. Primarily this course will focus on essential characteristics of the three major legal systems: Civil, Common, and Islamic and Sharia. The class will also examine the diverse legal systems, inspired by various political, social, and religious doctrines, successfully used by billions of people in various parts of the world. This course will pay special attention to law traditions explicitly functioning in United States of America, and United Arab Emirates. This class will offer a historical and cultural background related to the development of legal structures and substantive rules in both territories. Students will study existing judicial systems, and essential rules dealing with legal education and practice in U.S. and Emirates.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region.

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

POLSC-AD 152X Comparative Politics of the Middle East                                                                                         A focus on the &quot;Arab Middle East&quot; presupposes that regional culture is a significant factor in explaining political outcomes in the region. For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life. Each student is expected to complete a final research project exploring the core questions posed by the course.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

VISAR-AD 103X Introduction to Visual Culture                                                                                         Visual Culture Studies branches away from the traditional preoccupations of Art History towards new subjects and methodologies. It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 131X A &amp; E ll: Contemporary Debates about the Middle East and Islamic World                                                        It is perhaps not too much of an exaggeration to suggest that there exists no other region or cultural grouping in the world today that has undergone such intense scrutiny as that of Middle East and Islamic world. With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

Arab Crossroads Major                       Abu Dhabi is a natural setting for studying the complex cultural, political, and economic dynamics of the Arab and Islamic worlds. The Arab Crossroads program provides a portal for the global NYU community to study and engage with the cultural and intellectual diversity of this complex region, one we might think of as a space of multiple encounters and transactions.                                                          Arab Crossroads Concentration                       This multidisciplinary concentration allows students to study this important region from a number of disciplinary perspectives: Economics, History, Political Science, Literature, and Philosophy. In addition to coursework, students have the opportunity to travel to some of the countries in these regions and experience first-hand the issues that are raised in class.

In recent years, Arabic language students have traveled to Jordan to gain an appreciation for the cultural and linguistic nuances of the greater region.

major in Film and New Media emphasizes interdisciplinary and global approaches to film and new media. Students develop critical and interpretive skills for making and understanding documentary, experimental, narrative, and interactive styles of film and new media and learn the methods and theoretical models for analyzing film, new media and their histories. The six electives classes can be taken from any area in the curriculum, but students should work with an advisor in the Film and New Media program to plan a sequence to support a particular interest. Only one course may double-count for the major in Film and New Media and another major or concentration.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

Using stills and video, integrating theory and practice, students learn the essentials of cinematic language from composition to editing. Themes of Sense of Place, Portrait, and Memoir are explored in the context of projects assigned. Diegetic and non-diegetic sound, and/or voiceover supplement the visual storytelling. Students work individually and in collaboration. Goals of the course include an understanding of professional protocol and the dialogue of critique. Four lab sessions outside of class are mandatory.

This course analyzes and puts into practice principles of different forms of dramatic and dynamic writing: classical, episodic, and parametric in narrative and documentary; rhythmic and contrapuntal in experimental film; episodes and attractions for web platforms; interactive and auto-generative in new media. Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

Topics include theme, character, research, story, conflict, dialogue, and script editing. The course aims to make a connection between the ancient traditions of the oral storyteller and the professional practice of the contemporary screenwriter when pitching to producers. Screenings and discussions focus on classical and contemporary examples of the short film from a variety of genres, traditions, and cultures. All students complete two short screenplays.

FILMM-AD 116J Single Shot Cinema                                             In this hands-on course, we explore the vocabulary of camera movement and the dramatic impact of the long, single take. Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

In this course students design sound for ongoing theatrical productions, films by NYUAD students, or installation work, and learn how to approach sound design for these diverse media. Topics such as Automatic Dialog Replacement (ADR), Foley, post-synchronized sound and musique concr&egrave;te techniques are covered, and several examples of sound design for film and theatrical performance are analyzed and discussed in class, leading the students to develop their own conceptual approaches to sound design.    * Prerequiste: MUSIC-AD 106 and MUSIC-AD 120 or equivalent.

THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting                                                                              Students begin to build a performance vocabulary by using a range of techniques for translating the actor&rsquo;s imagination into stage action. Students are introduced to the internal and external demands of turning psychology into behavior. Students explore acting fundamentals, such as investing yourself in the moment, genuinely listening, personalizing fictional material; and playing objectives are initially explored via games, improvisations, and exercises, followed by partnered scene work, ensemble technique, and solo performance.

THEAT-AD 115 Directing the Actor                                                                                         A course for theater directors, filmmakers, actors, and visual artists. Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region. Through ethnography, literature, film and fieldwork, we will explore such topics as Orientalism and its legacy; constructs of youth, gender, family and tribe; poetry and mediation; generational and social change; oil, development and globalization; transnational labor, migration and diaspora; Indian Ocean networks; pilgrimage and piety; the Islamic Revival; faith, medicine, and bioethics; displacement and dispossession; refugees and human rights; and the Arab uprisings.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise.

How is &ldquo;the past&rdquo; recovered, commemorated, embodied, erased, marketed and consumed in the modern Middle East? This course focuses on various thematics of history, heritage, and memory practices: national commemorations and contested sites and events; embodied and gendered memories; invented traditions and structural nostalgia; the problems of writing oral histories; the politics of archaeology; museums and exhibitions; and the construction (and destruction) of tangible, intangible, and world heritage.

This was especially the case during the eight centuries from 711&ndash;1492 when various parts of the Iberian peninsula were ruled over by Muslims. In this course we look both at how what are today Morocco and Spain were connected in this period in both history and imagination, and at how the Spanish colonial presence in Morocco in the 20th century played a important role in the Spanish civil war.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin by discussing the basic science and availability of energy sources, the state of technology, the functioning of energy markets, the challenges of coping with global climate change and the key role of the oil reserves in the Middle East. The second part of the course focuses on the history of oil in the Middle East and its impact on societies in the region.

ACS-AD 232X Society and Politics of Saudi Arabia                                                                              This course is an introduction to the study of Saudi Arabia and can be taken as a gateway course to the Arab Crossroads concentration. Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

ACS-AD 233X War and Media in the Middle East                                                                                                    This course examines two simultaneous processes in the Middle East since the mid-20th century: 1) how war has become mediatized, and 2) how media has been militarized. Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence. Through these analyses, students will gain an understanding of the experiences of, conflicts over, and representations of notions such as territory, landscape, body, nation, gender, memory, terror, freedom, and spectacle.

ACS-AD 234X Arabs, X and Modernity                                                                              This course explores the centrality of sex to the construction of modernity through case studies drawn primarily from the Arab world. Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

ACS-AD 263J Modern Architecture in Abu Dhabi                                                                                                    This course is an exploration of modern architecture in the city. Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields. The course culminates in an extended research proposal for a capstone project.

COREP-AD 01W Culture and Difference :1001 Nights                                                                   This course focuses on questions of religious and cultural difference through the 1001 Nights and related texts. Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful? How has the history of the Near East compared to that of other parts of the world and what light do those comparisons shed on the region&rsquo;s experience?    *Note: Passing the Economics Placement test will stand in place of the prerequiste (ECON-AD 101).

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

By examining pre-cinematic artistic practices, aesthetic traditions, cinematic styles, political economies of media, and social change, the course provides a context for understanding productions from major industries in Cairo, Chennai, and Mumbai alongside work by independent filmmakers and new media collectives from throughout the regions. Students are encouraged to attend film festivals and engage in original research with the NYUAD Library special collection of MENASA film.

Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women&rsquo;s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define a thesis topic of their choice, develop a bibliography, read broadly in background works, and begin their research.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

The basic spread of subjects treated is poetry and prose narrative; but there will be a nuancing of literary genres and categories (especially of those peculiar to the Arabic tradition). Students will be introduced to main approaches to the study of this broad and deep literary tradition. Texts will include selections from: Pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluke period. Prose literature will include The Qur&#39;an; Hadith; Apocrypha of the Prophets; Picaresque Maqamahs; the Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

Students review literature and press examples of how Arab and Western media, popular culture, and political commentary portray each other. They design and execute a public opinion survey of U.S. and Arab attitudes in order to better understand how each side sees the other&mdash;using the poll-driven data to measure the gaps in understanding. The course also includes a televised town hall discussion with the students as participants engaging each other and peers from across the region in an examination of the topic.

It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life.

The first section of the course provides a philosophical foundation for debates about women, work, and difference based on feminist theories. In particular, we will explore postcolonial perspectives on feminism and difference, feminist Marxist critiques of capitalism, and feminist Islamist critiques of modernity. The second part of the course provides an overview of how women in the Gulf feature in contemporary discourses as participants in &ldquo;globally competitive&rdquo; economies, mothers of &ldquo;future generations of citizens&rdquo;, and symbols of &ldquo;tradition and culture&rdquo;. The third part of the course provides an overview of the public policy and legal frameworks shaping women&rsquo;s work. In particular, this section of the course explores how different categories of &ldquo;women&rdquo; are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers involved in policies shaping women&rsquo;s work experiences in the Gulf.

Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).
