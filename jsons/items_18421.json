Investigates two governing principles of American society: the fact that it is a market society and the fact that it is a democracy. Examines how the fact of its being a capitalist democracy affects the distribution of goods, rights, and powers.

Studies the premise that war is much more than a means to an end (a rational, if very brutal, activity intended to serve the interests of one group by destroying those who oppose that group). Mounds of evidence suggest that war exercises a powerful fascination that has its greatest impact on participants but is by no means limited to them. War, in short, is a complex web of affiliations and emotions.
