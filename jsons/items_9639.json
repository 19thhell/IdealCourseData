To facilitate research abroad, CLACS offers Field Research Grants each year, pending funding, which are awarded on a competitive basis. The department offers competitive Summer FLAS Fellowships for intensive language study.    Can I pursue an internship as a Masters\u2019 student? Yes. CLACS offers internships at prestigious local organizations, both for credit and non-credit. Those seeking graduate credit enroll in a 2- or 4- point Internship Seminar, in conjunction with the internship. Students develop a scholarly work \u2013 usually a course paper \u2013 putting their internship experience into academic focus.      Where do CLACS graduates work after graduation? Students work in a variety of private and public sector jobs, and most continue to be involved with Latin American or Caribbean regional issues. Many recent CLACS graduates have secured jobs in the field of education, either working as teachers or researchers, or entering competitive PhD programs to become professors. Many have found placement in non-profit organizations, working in the areas of culture, arts, research, and policy. Global Journalism students have a strong record of placement at major news outlets, and Museum studies students similarly find work in museums, galleries, or as independent curators. Several have pursued work in government and related to foreign policy. Does NYU offer a PhD in Latin American and Caribbean Studies? No. NYU\u2019s Department of History includes a Ph.D. field specialization in the study of Latin America and the Caribbean. While all of the History Department Faculty that teach this specialization are affiliated with CLACS, the PhD program has no formal connection to the MA degree.      How much are tuition and fees for the MA? The schedule for tuition and fees can be found on the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences website .      Are there scholarships and financial aid available for MA students? Yes. CLACS offers several fellowships and partial tuition remission to incoming and current students, on a competitive basis. In addition to departmental awards, NYU offers financial assistance in form of merit-based and need-based scholarships, grants, and loans. To qualify for these awards, you must fill out the FAFSA form by the first application deadline (February 1). More information can be found on Graduate School of Arts and Sciences website and the NYU Office of Financial Aid.      Is financial aid available for international students? Yes. International students are eligible for some departmental fellowships and tuition remission. They are not eligible for FLAS funding, or for federal financial aid.      I want to apply. Where do I start?  To apply, please visit the GSAS Application Resource Center for instructions and to download an application.      Can the writing sample I send be in Spanish, Portuguese, or in a language other than English? No. Because your courses at NYU will be taught in English, we need to see your writing in English. If you are a non-native speaker of English, you may send one supplemental writing sample in Spanish or Portuguese if you feel this would better represent your analytical or scholarly abilities.          FAQ's for Incoming Students    Who is my academic advisor? Can it be any faculty member?   Your primary academic advisors are the Center\u2019s Director, Clinical Associate Professor Pamela Calla, and the Faculty Fellow Professors Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales and Katherine Smith. You should meet with your advisor twice persemester, and for registration advisement. You are encouraged to establish contacts with other faculty working in the area of their interests, particularly other CLACS faculty, as these professors could serve both as additional advisors or as readers for your Master\u2019s Project.      How do I find professors who are working in my area of interest?   Your academic advisor should be able to suggest relevant faculty; be sure to ask them during your advisement sessions. You should also consult our affiliated faculty listing, which includes brief biographies of most faculty at NYU working on issues related to Latin America and the Caribbean. Check Albert and relevant department websites for graduate course listings to find faculty teaching in your areas of interest.      I want to take a class in another department. What do I do?   Many graduate seminars require the instructor\u2019s or department\u2019s permission to register, and this is usually noted in Albert on the Department\u2019s graduate course listings. Some seminars are restricted to PhD students or students in that department, and will not be open to you. However, many seminars welcome and are designed for MA students. You may be asked to contact the Professor directly, or contact the Department. If approved, they will give you an access code that will enable you to register.      What if I am not sure whether a class really interests me? Should I register anyway? Because space is often limited in seminars, we recommend that you register for your first choice classes prior to the start of the term. However, it is expected that students will attend the first class and then decide whether they want to stay in the seminar. You may also contact the professors and sit in on the first class without registering for it. The last day to add a class without late fees is the end of the 2nd week of classes. For a full refund schedule for dropping a class, please visit the Bursar\u2019s website.       How can I take classes at Columbia? Can I take whatever I want?  CLACS students may take selected courses offered through the Institute for Latin American Studies (ILAS). These classes will be listed with our current course offerings . To register for one of these classes, first register under the CLACS course number associated with the course. Second, fill out a cross- registration form . It must to be signed by your professor at Columbia (on the first day of class), and by Amalia C\u00f3rdova at CLACS before you are officially registered in the course. It is your responsibility to file this paperwork; without it, we will not be able to file a grade for the course. CLACS students may petition CLACS to enroll in a Columbia course that is not one of the cross-listed seminars; please contact Amalia C\u00f3rdova. Enrollment is contingent on approval from ILAS, the Department offering the course, and the Professor. Some units, like the School for International and Public Affairs (SIPA), are not able to accommodate any students outside of their program.      I am not really sure how to use the library and its resources. Where do I start?   The library has excellent resources for graduate students . Incoming students are strongly encouraged to take Bobst Library Research workshops on arrival at NYU (Research 101, 102); international students are also encouraged to take \u201cIntroduction to United States Research Libraries.\u201d The Latin American Studies page of the Bobst Library offers a comprehensive listing of bibliographic resources and databases about Latin America and the Caribbean.

Many have found placement in non-profit organizations, working in the areas of culture, arts, research, and policy. Global Journalism students have a strong record of placement at major news outlets, and Museum studies students similarly find work in museums, galleries, or as independent curators. Several have pursued work in government and related to foreign policy. Does NYU offer a PhD in Latin American and Caribbean Studies? No. NYU\u2019s Department of History includes a Ph.D. field specialization in the study of Latin America and the Caribbean.

Can the writing sample I send be in Spanish, Portuguese, or in a language other than English? No. Because your courses at NYU will be taught in English, we need to see your writing in English. If you are a non-native speaker of English, you may send one supplemental writing sample in Spanish or Portuguese if you feel this would better represent your analytical or scholarly abilities.          FAQ's for Incoming Students    Who is my academic advisor? Can it be any faculty member?   Your primary academic advisors are the Center\u2019s Director, Clinical Associate Professor Pamela Calla, and the Faculty Fellow Professors Edgardo P\u00e9rez Morales and Katherine Smith. You should meet with your advisor twice persemester, and for registration advisement. You are encouraged to establish contacts with other faculty working in the area of their interests, particularly other CLACS faculty, as these professors could serve both as additional advisors or as readers for your Master\u2019s Project.      How do I find professors who are working in my area of interest?   Your academic advisor should be able to suggest relevant faculty; be sure to ask them during your advisement sessions. You should also consult our affiliated faculty listing, which includes brief biographies of most faculty at NYU working on issues related to Latin America and the Caribbean. Check Albert and relevant department websites for graduate course listings to find faculty teaching in your areas of interest.      I want to take a class in another department. What do I do?   Many graduate seminars require the instructor\u2019s or department\u2019s permission to register, and this is usually noted in Albert on the Department\u2019s graduate course listings. Some seminars are restricted to PhD students or students in that department, and will not be open to you. However, many seminars welcome and are designed for MA students. You may be asked to contact the Professor directly, or contact the Department. If approved, they will give you an access code that will enable you to register.      What if I am not sure whether a class really interests me? Should I register anyway? Because space is often limited in seminars, we recommend that you register for your first choice classes prior to the start of the term. However, it is expected that students will attend the first class and then decide whether they want to stay in the seminar. You may also contact the professors and sit in on the first class without registering for it. The last day to add a class without late fees is the end of the 2nd week of classes. For a full refund schedule for dropping a class, please visit the Bursar\u2019s website.       How can I take classes at Columbia? Can I take whatever I want?

CLACS students may petition CLACS to enroll in a Columbia course that is not one of the cross-listed seminars; please contact Amalia C\u00f3rdova. Enrollment is contingent on approval from ILAS, the Department offering the course, and the Professor. Some units, like the School for International and Public Affairs (SIPA), are not able to accommodate any students outside of their program.
