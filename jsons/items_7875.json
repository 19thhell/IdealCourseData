The report assumes successful completion of all course work in progress and takes into consideration approved substitutions, waivers and degree exceptions. As requirements are completed, they are collapsed within the report and only outstanding requirements remain expanded.    The Advisement Report can be accessed by selecting \"Academic Requirements\" from the drop down menu in Albert.

The purpose of the Advisement Report is to enhance advising by providing accurate and comprehensive information that can be used in consultation with an advisor to make course selection decisions. It is an unofficial document and should be used as an advisement tool that should not take the place of meetings with an academic advisor. All students are encouraged to contact their advisor for academic and career counseling. Additionally, an advisor will be able to anticipate problems and make adjustments to a program, when necessary.    It is important that students in the undergraduate schools consult their Academic Advisement Report in Albert to monitor their progress toward the academic program they intend to complete. Contact your advisor immediately if you believe there are any errors or discrepancies in the report or if you need to request a waiver or substitution to satisfy your program.    IF YOU EXPECT TO GRADUATE THIS SEMESTER: Please remember to view your Academic Advisement Report to ensure that all academic requirements will be satisfied by the end of the term, so that you may graduate on time.

For students who attended summer semester 2011 and later, please see the current policy document Eligibility for Financial Aid .                      TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS    To be considered for financial aid each year, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements and be in good academic standing. Students must complete an average of 32 credit points per academic year (fall, spring, and summer semesters) with grades of A, B, C, D, or P and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. In addition, students must complete all degree requirements in four years unless the student is enrolled in an officially recognized five-year program (i.e. HEOP/CSTEP). Students are required to graduate within eight full-time semesters or after earning 128 credits (including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status), whichever comes first. Therefore, transfer students and freshmen students entering NYU with approved credits may be expected to complete degree requirements in less than four years, depending on the number of credit points received when entering the University.      Satisfactory academic progress standards are easily met; however, it is very important to be attentive to the progress standards when registering each semester to prevent both NYU and federal financial aid from being jeopardized.      Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress may be eligible to receive financial aid for a single additional semester, but only if normal progress can be restored within that semester. Progress requirements will not be waived more than once under most circumstances.      Credit points to be successfully completed per academic year for traditional (non-McGhee) full-time degree students:           Year     Credit Points      1     32      2     64      3     96      4     128          ADVANCED PLACEMENT, ADVANCED STANDING, AND TRANSFER STUDENTS     Accepted credit points from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status are considered to be completed credits toward a total limit of eight full-time semesters. Each set of 16 credit points accepted from these sources counts as one earned semester of financial aid. To calculate the semesters earned, add the number of accepted Advanced/Transfer credits, divide by 16, and round down the result.          Accepted Advance/Transfer Credit Points     Semesters Earned Toward Degree      16-31        1      32-47     2      48-63     3      64-79     4      80-95     5      96-111     6      112-127     7          GRADUATE STUDENTS      Each year, your current New York University academic transcript is reviewed to verify that you are in good academic standing and making normal progress toward the completion of your degree requirements. \"Good standing\" means that you are maintaining the minimum grade point average (GPA) required by your school or department, are earning a passing grade in a minimum of 80 percent of the courses in which you are enrolled (minimum of 66 percent for GSAS students, minimum of 75 percent for law students), and have resolved the status of any unsatisfactory grades (as defined by your school) e.g. \"incomplete,\" \"no grade,\" etc.      Most graduate schools at the University require a minimum GPA of 3.0. This may vary, so you should consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic requirements published in your school's bulletin. Normal progress requires completing all courses registered for and progressing toward your degree at a level that compares favorably with other registrants working toward the same degree in the same academic program.      Generally, full-time students register for and complete 12 credit points per semester, achieving a master's degree in two years and a doctorate degree in five years. The maximum time for completion of degree requirements is available in the Office of the Registrar. NYU may require that incomplete courses (IPs) be completed and verification of grades be provided before finalizing an aid decision. If aid has not been renewed due to unsatisfactory progress, you should contact the Office of Financial Aid.       EXTENSION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY      Financial aid funding (federal, state, and campus based) is designed to help students complete their degree requirements within a limited period of time and is generally not available beyond that point. In certain circumstances, however, the Office of Financial Aid may authorize additional student funding for one or more semesters. To be considered for an extension of financial aid eligibility, submit an Aid Eligibility Extension Request Form, available here .       HEOP AND CSTEP      Undergraduate students participating in the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or the New York State Collegiate Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) must meet a cumulative grade point average of at least 1.3 for their first semester and a GPA of at least 2.0 thereafter.      Credit points to be successfully completed per full-time semester (not including summer):          Semester     Credit Points      1     8         2     20      3     32      4     44      5     56      6     68      7     82      8     96      9     112      10     128          PAUL MCGHEE DIVISION      SCPS Paul McGhee Division students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements. This means that McGhee students must successfully complete a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Students in an associate's degree program must complete their current degree requirements in seven full-time (14 part-time) semesters or 80 total attempted credits (whichever comes first). Students in a bachelor's degree program must complete their current degree requirements in 14 full-time (28 part-time) semesters or 170 total attempted credits (whichever comes first). In addition, McGhee students receiving scholarship funds may be subject to more rigorous progress criteria; please consult with a McGhee Division advisor.       INTERNAL TRANSFERS      Students who transfer from a full-time (non-McGhee) NYU undergraduate program into the Paul McGhee Division will continue to be reviewed as full-time undergraduate students until after they have attempted 16 credits in the McGhee program. After they have attempted 16 credits, they will be reviewed according to McGhee program academic standards. Students who transfer from the Paul McGhee program into a (non-McGhee) NYU full-time undergraduate program will continue to be reviewed as a McGhee student until they have attended at least two full-time semesters in a (non-McGhee) full-time undergraduate program. After they have attended two full-time semesters they will be reviewed according to full-time (non-McGhee) undergraduate academic standards.       DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM      Students who are enrolled in the Dental Hygiene Program at the College of Dentistry should consult with their department adviser or refer to the school bulletin for specific progress requirements. Information is available on the College of Dentistry Web site .       PART-TIME STUDENTS      Part-time students are expected to successfully complete 80 percent of all courses they attempt each semester and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0; however, they may take longer than four years to complete degree requirements.       RESTORING ELIGIBILITY      All students who are denied financial aid due to unsatisfactory academic progress may request a review of their status once they have removed incomplete grades from their record or otherwise posted additional earned academic credits.

The report displays the courses that can be selected from to complete specific requirements and how the courses taken, including transfer, and test credit, apply towards degree requirements. The report assumes successful completion of all course work in progress and takes into consideration approved substitutions, waivers and degree exceptions. As requirements are completed, they are collapsed within the report and only outstanding requirements remain expanded.    The Advisement Report can be accessed by selecting \"Academic Requirements\" from the drop down menu in Albert. A \"What-if Report\" can also be selected to enable students to run a degree audit report based on what-if situations, such as, a potential course selection, grade, or to be audited against a completely different set of degree, major, and/or minor requirements.    The purpose of the Advisement Report is to enhance advising by providing accurate and comprehensive information that can be used in consultation with an advisor to make course selection decisions. It is an unofficial document and should be used as an advisement tool that should not take the place of meetings with an academic advisor. All students are encouraged to contact their advisor for academic and career counseling. Additionally, an advisor will be able to anticipate problems and make adjustments to a program, when necessary.    It is important that students in the undergraduate schools consult their Academic Advisement Report in Albert to monitor their progress toward the academic program they intend to complete. Contact your advisor immediately if you believe there are any errors or discrepancies in the report or if you need to request a waiver or substitution to satisfy your program.    IF YOU EXPECT TO GRADUATE THIS SEMESTER: Please remember to view your Academic Advisement Report to ensure that all academic requirements will be satisfied by the end of the term, so that you may graduate on time. Make sure that all Dean or Departmental waivers, exemptions or substitutions are submitted to the Registrar no later than the close of the term or you will be ineligible to graduate and will have to postpone your graduation for another semester.

For students who attended summer semester 2011 and later, please see the current policy document Eligibility for Financial Aid .                      TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS    To be considered for financial aid each year, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements and be in good academic standing. Students must complete an average of 32 credit points per academic year (fall, spring, and summer semesters) with grades of A, B, C, D, or P and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. In addition, students must complete all degree requirements in four years unless the student is enrolled in an officially recognized five-year program (i.e. HEOP/CSTEP). Students are required to graduate within eight full-time semesters or after earning 128 credits (including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status), whichever comes first. Therefore, transfer students and freshmen students entering NYU with approved credits may be expected to complete degree requirements in less than four years, depending on the number of credit points received when entering the University.      Satisfactory academic progress standards are easily met; however, it is very important to be attentive to the progress standards when registering each semester to prevent both NYU and federal financial aid from being jeopardized.      Students who are not making satisfactory academic progress may be eligible to receive financial aid for a single additional semester, but only if normal progress can be restored within that semester. Progress requirements will not be waived more than once under most circumstances.      Credit points to be successfully completed per academic year for traditional (non-McGhee) full-time degree students:           Year     Credit Points      1     32      2     64      3     96      4     128          ADVANCED PLACEMENT, ADVANCED STANDING, AND TRANSFER STUDENTS     Accepted credit points from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status are considered to be completed credits toward a total limit of eight full-time semesters. Each set of 16 credit points accepted from these sources counts as one earned semester of financial aid. To calculate the semesters earned, add the number of accepted Advanced/Transfer credits, divide by 16, and round down the result.          Accepted Advance/Transfer Credit Points     Semesters Earned Toward Degree      16-31        1      32-47     2      48-63     3      64-79     4      80-95     5      96-111     6      112-127     7          GRADUATE STUDENTS      Each year, your current New York University academic transcript is reviewed to verify that you are in good academic standing and making normal progress toward the completion of your degree requirements. \"Good standing\" means that you are maintaining the minimum grade point average (GPA) required by your school or department, are earning a passing grade in a minimum of 80 percent of the courses in which you are enrolled (minimum of 66 percent for GSAS students, minimum of 75 percent for law students), and have resolved the status of any unsatisfactory grades (as defined by your school) e.g. \"incomplete,\" \"no grade,\" etc.      Most graduate schools at the University require a minimum GPA of 3.0. This may vary, so you should consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic requirements published in your school's bulletin. Normal progress requires completing all courses registered for and progressing toward your degree at a level that compares favorably with other registrants working toward the same degree in the same academic program.      Generally, full-time students register for and complete 12 credit points per semester, achieving a master's degree in two years and a doctorate degree in five years. The maximum time for completion of degree requirements is available in the Office of the Registrar. NYU may require that incomplete courses (IPs) be completed and verification of grades be provided before finalizing an aid decision. If aid has not been renewed due to unsatisfactory progress, you should contact the Office of Financial Aid.       EXTENSION OF FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY      Financial aid funding (federal, state, and campus based) is designed to help students complete their degree requirements within a limited period of time and is generally not available beyond that point. In certain circumstances, however, the Office of Financial Aid may authorize additional student funding for one or more semesters. To be considered for an extension of financial aid eligibility, submit an Aid Eligibility Extension Request Form, available here .       HEOP AND CSTEP      Undergraduate students participating in the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or the New York State Collegiate Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) must meet a cumulative grade point average of at least 1.3 for their first semester and a GPA of at least 2.0 thereafter.      Credit points to be successfully completed per full-time semester (not including summer):          Semester     Credit Points      1     8         2     20      3     32      4     44      5     56      6     68      7     82      8     96      9     112      10     128          PAUL MCGHEE DIVISION      SCPS Paul McGhee Division students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of degree requirements. This means that McGhee students must successfully complete a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Students in an associate's degree program must complete their current degree requirements in seven full-time (14 part-time) semesters or 80 total attempted credits (whichever comes first). Students in a bachelor's degree program must complete their current degree requirements in 14 full-time (28 part-time) semesters or 170 total attempted credits (whichever comes first). In addition, McGhee students receiving scholarship funds may be subject to more rigorous progress criteria; please consult with a McGhee Division advisor.       INTERNAL TRANSFERS      Students who transfer from a full-time (non-McGhee) NYU undergraduate program into the Paul McGhee Division will continue to be reviewed as full-time undergraduate students until after they have attempted 16 credits in the McGhee program. After they have attempted 16 credits, they will be reviewed according to McGhee program academic standards. Students who transfer from the Paul McGhee program into a (non-McGhee) NYU full-time undergraduate program will continue to be reviewed as a McGhee student until they have attended at least two full-time semesters in a (non-McGhee) full-time undergraduate program. After they have attended two full-time semesters they will be reviewed according to full-time (non-McGhee) undergraduate academic standards.       DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM      Students who are enrolled in the Dental Hygiene Program at the College of Dentistry should consult with their department adviser or refer to the school bulletin for specific progress requirements. Information is available on the College of Dentistry Web site .       PART-TIME STUDENTS      Part-time students are expected to successfully complete 80 percent of all courses they attempt each semester and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0; however, they may take longer than four years to complete degree requirements.       RESTORING ELIGIBILITY      All students who are denied financial aid due to unsatisfactory academic progress may request a review of their status once they have removed incomplete grades from their record or otherwise posted additional earned academic credits.
