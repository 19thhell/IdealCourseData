Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, BS    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide, and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education, and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual BA Math/MA Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a BA Math/MA Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science, and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual-degree programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    Minors    * Teacher Education * Global and Urban Education Studies    Mathematics Education, MA    The master's degree program in mathematics education prepares students to teach at the middle school through high school level. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Teaching and Learning with a Focus on Mathematics Education, PhD    The focus of our doctoral program is to develop your abilities to do research in mathematics education at the elementary, secondary, or post-secondary level, for students who would like to pursue a PhD in Teaching and Learning, with a focus on mathematics education.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living-family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Focus on State-of-the-Art Methods    In the bachelor of science program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning , our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and women surmount learning barriers.    Faculty on the Cutting Edge    Our faculty is involved in cutting edge research and development projects and represent the university and program on national and international commissions. The core faculty in the program include:       Anne Burgunder - Master Teacher in Mathematics Education    Judith Green - Master Teacher in Mathematics Education    Orit Zaslavsky - Professor of Mathematics Education       A Variety of Resources    You take liberal arts as well as mathematics and computer science courses in the College of Arts and Science. Courses in teaching methods and curriculum development are taken in The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Special resources available to you include NYU's internationally renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the University's numerous microcomputer centers.    Small Program, Personal Contact    As a student in mathematics education, you are part of a small program. You have daily contact with the full-time faculty, as well as with a diverse rangeof students preparing to teach other secondary school subjects.
