We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others.

Classical Literature &amp; Philosophy: Gender &amp; Genre    Bianchi    Thurs   11:00-1:45pm   COLIT-UA 160   In this course we will explore the co-emergence of philosophy and various literary genres (epic, lyric poetry, dialogue, tragedy, comedy) in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the development of literary and rhetorical theory. Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao. Films will  include a selection from: The Leopard, Salvatore  Giuliano, Rocco and His Brothers, Divorce Italian Style, La terra trema, Death  in Venice, L\u2019America, Birth of a Nation,  The Emperor Jones, Baby Doll, Suddenly Last Summer, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cabin  in the Sky, Raisin in the Sun, Daughters of the Dust, Gone With the Wind,  Jezebel, The Little Foxes, To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Cool Hand Luke, Deliverance,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Slingblade, La ultima cena, Memorias del subdesarrollo, Lugar sin l\u00edmites       Topics in 20th Century Literature: Richard Wright's Books   Garcia    Mon 12:30-3:15pm   COLIT-UA 190.002   SCA-UA 715 In a scene from his classic book Black Boy, Richard Wright describes the clandestine means by which he obtained library books otherwise unavailable to him in the segregated, color-coded social world of the early twentieth-century U.S. South. By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.   The following subjects (among  others) will be discussed:   -- Modern Rationality and Modern  Science.   -- Changing notion of Experience.   -- New understanding of Space, Distance, Time.   -- Culture of appearances.   -- Nation, State.   -- Democracy and Totalitarianism.   -- Violence, War and Discipline.   -- Machines.   -- Market, Money and the Struggle for Survival.   -- Commodity and Desire.    Readings include: Marx,  Freud, Descartes, Arendt, Foucault, Benjamin, Elias, Deleuze, Balibar, Lefort  and many others.      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud.

Requirements: Two 8 page papers and a presentation on a  class reading.   Unless otherwise noted, readings will  be posted on NYU Classes course site.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.

We will read literary works by Disraeli, Stendhal, Trollope, Zola, Mallarm\u00e9 and Proust that explore the microphenomenology of political life; the diffusion and dilution of \"the Political\" in the social; the elusiveness and formlessness of the political event; the role of contingency in A central question will be: How is politics as a scene of maneuvers and application of cunning (is Machiavellianism) mapped on (or not) to formal, abstract models of political aesthetics (capitalist epic, democracy in language, the \"revolutionary\" dimension of avant-gardism, comic forms of class struggle, tragic forms of communitas)? The final section of the course will examine politics as a popular, contemporary genre, especially in film and epic television serials. Examples studied will be Roberto Saviano's hit TV series Come Away With Me (read with Paolo Flores d'Arcais,'s \"Anatomy of Berlusconismo), Armando Iannucci's film In the Loop, and the recent TV series House of Cards. Requirements: One 12-15 page paper and an oral presentation. Students who want to work on a comparative project that brings in film or visual media may do so with instructor's approval.    Introduction to Comp Lit: Necessary Fiction  Basterra We like to think of ourselves as acting freely, creating our own ideas and objects. In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Salinas, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?    Junior Theory Seminar: Philosophy of the Body Bianchi What is a body, and how has the body figured in the history of Western thought? How is the body constituted in relation to its others: mind/spirit/soul? How does the body appear as an object both natural and technological? How do bodies come to bear social and political significance: in relation to sex, gender, class, race, sexuality, and bodily ability among others? How are bodies fashioned and produced by personal and cultural practices? In this class we will address the devaluation of the body and somatophobia in the history of Western philosophy, and track the resurgence of the body in 20th and 21st century thought, including existentialism, phenomenology, feminist theory, race theory, queer theory, disability theory and \u201cnew materialisms.\u201d Lastly, we will examine critical analyses of bodily regimes and practices, which may include (according to class interest) dieting, body modification, bodily violence, medical technologies.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Comparative Theory and the Intellectual Dopico   Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Garcia What is the relationship of autobiographical acts to history? How does the decline of history as an \u201cautonomous and self-authenticating mode of thought,\u201d to borrow from Hayden White, alter how we read autobiographies? Turning to literary analysis, how does autobiography figure in the tasks of autocritique associated with comparative thinking? What happens when we think of autobiographies less as \u201clife stories\u201d and more as \u201cactors,\u201d as Bruno Latour puts it, with which we interact as \u201cco-actors\u201d and by way of complex affects and associations? This course will turn periodically to theorizations of history, selfhood and objecthood. But most of our attention will be devoted to the autobiographical act itself as we explore works by Christopher Isherwood, James Weldon Johnson, Lillian Smith, Anatole Broyard and Jay-Z, among other writers.  Topics: Biopolitics & Violence in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin With the current changes to the world order in general, the economic and sociopolitical situation in Spain in particular, biopolitics\u2014implementing power through the bodies of and generating desired positions for the citizens\u2014offers a critical lens to understand how power operates by convincing, manipulating and criminalizing the masses. Whereas modern biopolitics refers to the State\u2019s ability to insert docile and disciplined bodies into its mechanisms of exercising power (Foucault), it also implies various degrees of violence, exclusion and abjection. Within this framework, this course will explore different forms of biopolitics with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices and as articulated in fiction and film in contemporary Spain. Some of the topics we will attend to include the Spanish Civil War, the Franco regime, nationalism, terrorism, delinquency and crime, and immigration. Primary writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Isaac Rosa, Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa, Guillermo del Toro, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Eloy de la Iglesia, Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Bernardo Atxaga, Bel\u00e9n Gopegui, Iciar Bolla\u00edn, Ricardo Men\u00e9ndez Salm\u00f3n, Chus Guti\u00e9rrez, Manuel Huerga or Agust\u00edn Villaronga. We will examine these literary works together with theoretical readings about biopolitics, violence, war and exclusion, and raise questions about the dynamics in Spain today.  MAP : Texts and Ideas: Paranoid Narratives Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. Critical and theoretical readings by Eric Barnouw, Roland Barthes, Stella Bruzzi, Jane Gaines, Jacques Derrida, Giorgio Agamben, Barbara Johnson, Bill Nichols, Philip Rosen, Vivian Sobchack, Susan Sontag, Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, Edward Said, Alan Sekula, and others.

Classical Literature &amp; Philosophy: Gender &amp; Genre    Bianchi    Thurs   11:00-1:45pm   COLIT-UA 160   In this course we will explore the co-emergence of philosophy and various literary genres (epic, lyric poetry, dialogue, tragedy, comedy) in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the development of literary and rhetorical theory. Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao. Films will  include a selection from: The Leopard, Salvatore  Giuliano, Rocco and His Brothers, Divorce Italian Style, La terra trema, Death  in Venice, L\u2019America, Birth of a Nation,  The Emperor Jones, Baby Doll, Suddenly Last Summer, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, Cabin  in the Sky, Raisin in the Sun, Daughters of the Dust, Gone With the Wind,  Jezebel, The Little Foxes, To Kill a Mockingbird, Cape Fear, Cool Hand Luke, Deliverance,  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, Slingblade, La ultima cena, Memorias del subdesarrollo, Lugar sin l\u00edmites       Topics in 20th Century Literature: Richard Wright's Books   Garcia    Mon 12:30-3:15pm   COLIT-UA 190.002   SCA-UA 715 In a scene from his classic book Black Boy, Richard Wright describes the clandestine means by which he obtained library books otherwise unavailable to him in the segregated, color-coded social world of the early twentieth-century U.S. South. By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.   The following subjects (among  others) will be discussed:   -- Modern Rationality and Modern  Science.   -- Changing notion of Experience.   -- New understanding of Space, Distance, Time.   -- Culture of appearances.   -- Nation, State.   -- Democracy and Totalitarianism.   -- Violence, War and Discipline.   -- Machines.   -- Market, Money and the Struggle for Survival.   -- Commodity and Desire.    Readings include: Marx,  Freud, Descartes, Arendt, Foucault, Benjamin, Elias, Deleuze, Balibar, Lefort  and many others.      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud. Note: Course enrollment limited to 20. Requirements: Four short papers (5-7 pp.) over the course of the semester.

Requirements: Two 8 page papers and a presentation on a  class reading.   Unless otherwise noted, readings will  be posted on NYU Classes course site.  Revisiting the Western Classics: Ancient Materialisms: Matter &amp; Gender in Classical Antiquity Bianchi      In the face of the rising popularity of \u201cnew materialisms\u201d it  is important to remember that the notion of \u201cmatter\u201d itself arose in a specific  historical and philosophical context in classical antiquity. Matter, from the  Latin \u2018 materia \u2019 (related to mater, mother) itself emerged from  Aristotle\u2019s Greek innovation hul\u00ea (literally,  wood). In this class we will undertake close readings of key ancient works on  the origin and constitution of the natural world and its intersections with the  human world, including prephilosophical cosmogonies, Presocratic philosophies  of nature, Aeschylus\u2019 Oresteia, Greek  atomism, Plato\u2019s Timaeus , Aristotle\u2019s   Physics, Metaphysics, and Generation of Animals , and Lucretius\u2019 De Rerum Natura, tracing the emergence  of discourses of materiality alongside and in concert with tropes of sex and  gender. To assist us in this endeavor we will draw on contemporary readings including  Heidegger, Kristeva, Irigaray, Loraux, Butler, and Grosz, as well as critically  engaging Bachofen\u2019s 19 th century conception of Mutterrecht . Some background knowledge of psychoanalytic theory is  advised as is knowledge of Greek, however all readings will be in translation. Topics in Caribbean Literature: Comparatism, Contigency, and the Caribbean Dopico  \u201c The Caribbean,\u201d as David Scott has  argued, \u201cis not merely modern\u2026. it is modern in a fundamentally inaugural way.\u201d  What does it mean to think of the Caribbean as an inaugural imaginary? And what does the Caribbean mean in a  post-colonial, post-socialist, post-revolutionary age? A long host of thinkers, writers and artists  of the nineteenth and twentieth century have insisted on the centrality of the  Caribbean as root and rhizome in our understanding of modernity and its  elements: enlightenment and capital, race and empire, sovereignty and  simulation, culture and nation, and, most romantically, or tragically,  revolution. But to think the Caribbean adequately one has to think beyond the  dialectics of roots and rhizome, beyond the poetics of relation, archipelago  and diaspora. This demands too that we read  beyond the tragic and monumental tropes of the Caribbean and read instead minor  forms and minor keys. Thinking and reading the Caribbean requires not only linguistic  and theoretical fluencies, but a capacity to read deep contexts and  contingencies within apparent economies of cultural and material scarcity. It  requires the capacity to engage the master paradigms of modernity and  simultaneously engage the more slippery problems of temporality, contingency,  misunderstanding, as well as the violent and demoralizing mechanisms of  domination, transaction and subordination.  This course considers  key texts and works of the Caribbean archipelago and reads them comparatively  and sometimes against the grain of their national, regional and postcolonial  inscriptions. We will read major cultural works and lesser-known expressions,  major literary works and alongside minor or forgotten forms. We will consider how the cultural monuments  of the Caribbean have occluded collective politics, aesthetic experiments,  insurgent movements and ephemeral forms. We counter pose the monumentality of  literature to the epistemologies and historical consciousness of other cultural  practices, aiming both for the contrapuntal and the counterintuitive. How, for example, have we come to understand  the Haitian Revolution or the Cuban Revolution within grand narratives and what  would it mean to read in them not epic, tragic destinies but more banal  parables about modernity \u2014destinies consonant with other forms of communal  politics, other orders of transaction and betrayal, from Paris, to Prague, from  Berlin to Grenada? Comparative questions abound: What does it mean to read a history of  revolution and civil rights in the Caribbean nineteenth century? What is the  specificity of Caribbean race theory? What is the distance between a history of  literature and a history of print culture in the Caribbean? How does literature  compete with visual aesthetics? How do  we \u201cread\u201d Aponte\u2019s lost book or desacralize Walcott\u2019s Omeros? How does Patrick Chamoiseau destroy the  postcolonial novel? How does Dulce Mar\u00eda Loynaz precede Sebald by half a  century? Why is Virgilio Pi\u00f1era like  Franz Kafka?  We will also ask  about discursive notions of the Caribbean: what and whether the reparative  poetics of relation and antillanit\u00e9 hold . We will engage the divisions between  Francophone, Anglophone, and Hispanophone Caribbean studies and trace cultural  and theoretical genealogies and segregations, asking if the Caribbean has a  common culture beyond the major tropic/al conceits that artists and scholars  have used to bind literary production. We will ask, in the tradition of Edward  Said, whether, like the East, \u201cCaribbeanism\u201d  becomes a career, what the field might mean, and how it exists. What is the place of the Caribbean in the  conceptions and political destinies of the American hemisphere or the Global  South? The syllabus is still  in progress but will include selections from major canonical Caribbean texts  (Casal, Hostos, James, M\u00e9traux, C\u00e9saire, Price Mars, Ma\u00f1ach, Marinello, Ortiz,  Cabrera, Walcott, Brathwaite, Lamming),    theorists and historians of the Caribbean (James, Cesaire, Glissant,  Moreno Fraginals, Ben\u00edtez Rojo, Trouillot, Scott), twentieth century literature (Carpentier,  Burgos, Loynaz, Lezama, Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, Pi\u00f1era, Walcott) through to the post-colonial Caribbean  Anglophone corpus and onto contemporary writers from Rita Indiana Hern\u00e1ndez to  Marlon James. We will pay special  attention to breaking postcolonial linguistic segregations, but also be mindful  of the operations and problem of genre, print culture, journal, performance,  and the pedagogies of civil society. We  will consider the formation of Caribbean Studies as a field and think of the  ways that journals from Or\u00edgenes and Tropiques , to Callaloo and Small Axe transform critical, artistic  and activist interventions on the Caribbean, and translate to intellectual  practices in the academy.          Comparative Poetics/Proseminar in Poetics &amp; Theory: Prose and Cons: Poetics in the Age of Prose Gadberry The long eighteenth-century has accrued a long   series of appellations, the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, the   Augustan Age, and the Age of Prose among them. At the end of the   seventeenth century, the famous poet and critic Boileau is said to have   announced that Descartes himself had \u201ccut poetry\u2019s throat\u201d while Matthew   Arnold looked back and deemed even the great poets of the eighteenth   century to be writing prose in their verse. Our course attempts to   uncover the fate of poetics in this \u201cage of prose and reason.\u201d How and   where do we find poetics at a moment at which poetry appears to be dead?   Our inquiry will pursue the longstanding antagonism between philosophy   and poetry as we plumb texts central to the conceptual legacy of the   period before the revival of poetics and poetry with Romanticism. Is   there a poetics of reason, of toleration, of common sense, of   laissez-faire? Just where does poetry go, and what might this have to do   with the birth of criticism? How does a poetics undergird the   subjectivities and, indeed, the systems that authors of the period   imagine? As we read texts of the period, we will engage twentieth- and   twenty-first-century interlocutors who will help us puzzle over what and   where poetry is in the moments of its apparent defeat or disappearance. Early   modern texts may include works by Hobbes, Milton, Locke, Corneille,   Boileau, Pope, Defoe, Baumgarten, Kant, Shaftesbury, Rousseau, and Vico.   Our modern texts may include works by Benjamin, Badiou, Derrida,   Peirce, Wittgenstein, Richards, among others. All texts will be   available in translation, but reading knowledge of French and/or German a   plus.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America Garcia This  seminar examines the transnational turn in U.S. literary studies and the  resulting reconfiguration of the relationship between American Studies and  Comparative Literature. We explore aesthetic renderings of \u201cAmerica\u201d during  different historical junctures and devote special attention to  re-conceptualizations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that create new objects of analysis, both  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. Along the way, we  examine divergent practices of comparative cultural studies, including theories  of the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of the  planetary. Alongside works by such writers as Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois, Jean  Toomer and Eric Walrond, and more recent contributions by such authors as  Joseph O\u2019Neill and Mohsin Hamid, we consider past and present social theory and  cultural criticism that impinge upon twenty-first century comparative literary  studies and American studies alike. Tropics in Translation: Translation and Comparatism  Halim In various ways, translation has always played a signal role  in comparatism. Aiming to shed light on both issues within translation theory  and the changing nature of Comparative Literature, this course will address the  topic in relation to: World Literature, travelling theory, Translation Studies vis-\u00e0-vis  Comparative Literature, and South-South comparatism, among others. Readings by:  Amal Amireh, Emily Apter, Talal Asad, Susan Bassnett, David Damrosch, Ferial  Ghazoul, Richard Jacquemond, Mohja Kahf, Andr\u00e9 Lefevere, Edward Said, Gayatri  Spivak, Haun Saussy, Harish Trivedi, Lawrence Venuti, and others. Biopolitics and Culture in Contemporary Spain Matos-Martin     The notion of biopolitics is widely used today in many  disciplines and discourses to reflect on issues as diverse as neoliberalism,  globalization, fascism, demographic changes, global security, or health  problems. This notion, however, has been relatively little used in Spain. In  this course students will be introduced to different theories of biopolitics  --with an emphasis on violence and exclusion practices-- as articulated in  Spanish contemporary culture. As such, we will mostly analyze films and literary  texts that address experiences of social and political exclusion, marginality,  precariousness, abandonment or poverty within the modern Spanish context\u2014from  the Spanish Civil War to the current moment of economic crisis. Theoretical  readings will include, among others, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito, Lemke,  Mbembe, Bauman, Lazzarato, Balibar, Butler, Negri and Ranci\u00e8re. Topics in African Literature: Africa--In Theory Sanders     Recently there has been an  explosion in \u201ctheory from the South.\u201d Some of the most exciting interventions  have come from African theorists such as Ato Quayson, Achille Mbembe, Jean and  John Comaroff, and Mahmood Mamdani. Taking recent works by these theorists as  our starting point, we will explore the application and adaptation of  metropolitan thinkers such as Foucault, Derrida, and Schmitt, in order to  theorize \u201cnecropolitics,\u201d genocide, and xenophobia, among other burning issues.  We will also take stock of earlier endeavors by Africanist and Afro-Americanist  thinkers such as Du Bois, Senghor, Mudimbe, Soyinka, and Ngugi to define  critically Africa\u2019s specific contributions to the making (and making sense of)  the world that all of us inhabit. Since a number of these thinkers are also  writers and/or literary theorists, we shall also be analyzing key recent texts  by Ahmadou Kourouma, Phaswane Mpe, and Antjie Krog.
