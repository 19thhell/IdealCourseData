The diverse pace of political and social developments in different nations resulted the varied stages of development in the recovery from the war, democratization, modernization and urbanization across Asia, and \"trauma\" and \"utopia\" stand as keywords both for looking at the past and for considering a better future. In the meantime, the theory and practice of art have taken on global dimensions, giving rise to an intellectual task to challenge the Euro-American, twentieth-century canons and to examine artistic interchanges and influences within Asia.   In this symposium, academics and curators from around the globe will gather to discuss a wide range of topics, from artistic engagements in political and social development and the urban landscape around Asia, to the notions of utopia and dystopia in the recovery from post-war period to the present in the field of performance art, and the individual artists' practice that reflect the ideas of trauma and utopia amongst other pertinent topics.

Recent studies in the archives and at archaeological sites have confirmed the antiquity, prestige and charm of these porcelains. They subtly blend Chinese subjects and Western naturalism into a fine Japanese achievement. Few earlier models, 1650-1830, have been ordered into a sensible time framework. This paper builds on the known dates to supply a sensible chronology. Many fine figurines were initially made for presentation by the Matsuras. The paper starts to distinguish these from the later, less well finished commercial examples out of the same moulds.   David Hyatt King started collecting Song Jun ware in 1964, under the guidance of Soame Jenyns. He then turned to Japanese porcelain of all periods, especially Kyushu and Kyoto porcelains. Early influences included the Percival David collection and he has never lost his enthusiasm for the finest Chinese.  David presented a substantial collection of Hirado porcelain to various museums after Gerald Reitlinger died in 1978. He lent extensively to Meiji, Japanese Art in Transition , The Hague, 1987. He actively participated in the The Lost Century (1998) exhibition in Edinburgh & Cambridge.

Tang Center for East Asian Art  [ from Tang Center , 9/30/14]     \"Chigusa in Context\" will focus on the tea-leaf storage jar named Chigusa and the broader production and appreciation of the arts within which it thrived in the sixteenth century. The jar was made in China sometime in the thirteenth or fourteenth century as a utilitarian container, and only after arriving in Japan was it admired aesthetically, given its name, and employed as a respected storage vessel for tea. This elevation in status took place within chanoyu, the practice of drinking bowls of whisked powdered tea while in a specially designed architectural space equipped with a range of objects selected for the participants appreciation. Chanoyu, however, was not pursued in isolation, and Chigusa and its admirers inevitably intersected with other artists and aspects of Japanese culture. \"Chigusa in Context\" will examine this expansive art world during the century of the jars greatest acclaim.

Designed inside and out by the Qianlong Emperor, the garden contains 26 buildings and pavilions, and is a thrilling manifestation of this emperor's visual imagination.   One of the world's greatest art connoisseurs, the 18th century Qianlong Emperor collected a myriad of ancient masterpieces but also relished his privileged opportunity to work with the finest artists and artisans to design and create all manner of inspired objects. With a deep knowledge of Chinese artistic traditions and a hungry interest in European aesthetics and styles, he and his workers produced extraordinary porcelains, trompe-l'oeil murals, and fantastical garden estates, the likes of which had never before been seen in China.

A \"golden age\" of Yellow Mountains travel came in the seventeenth century, when they became a refuge for loyalists protesting the new Qing Dynasty, among them poet and artist Wang Hongdu (16461721/1722), who dedicated himself to traveling to each and every peak and site and recording his impressions. Unfortunately, his resulting masterpiece of Chinese travel writing was not printed until 1775 and has since remained obscure and available only in Chinese. Jonathan Chaves will discuss Wang's masterpiece, and explore the history of scholarly and religious pilgrimage to the area, and the role of the Yellow Mountains in the great Neo-Confucian, Buddhist, and Daoist revivals of the early Qing period, that is, as the center of a yearned-for spiritual and cultural renaissance.   Jonathan Chaves is professor of Chinese literature at The George Washington University. His translations of Chinese poetry have been nominated for the National Book Award, and his work on the relationships between poetry and painting led to his curating of the exhibition, The Chinese Painter as Poet , at The China Institute (New York) in 2000.   back to page index     \"Locating 'Chu': The Construction, Utilisation, and Modification of Identity through Defining the Indispensable Other\"   Yun-ling Wang (University of California, Berkeley)  in the conference \"Strangers, Aliens and Foreigners\"  Prague, Czech Republic  1-3 November 2014   [from inter-disciplinary.net , 11/1/14]   back to page index     \"Cataloguing the East Asian Porcelains of Augustus the Strong: The Dresden Porcelain Project\"   Christiaan Jrg (Emeritus, Leiden University) and Cora Wrmell (Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden)  Christie's  London, UK  2 November 2014   [from Asian Art in London , 10/27/14]   back to page index     \"Diplomacy and Global Trade: Chinese Porcelain in the Early Ming Dynasty\"   Li Baoping (Sotheby's)  Sotheby's  London, UK  2 November 2014   [from Asian Art in London , 10/27/14]   back to page index     \"People of the Ming\"   Jessica Harrison-Hall (British Museum)  The Annual Bonhams/OCS Lecture  Bonhams  London, UK  3 November 2014   [from OCS , 10/27/14]   What was it like to live in early Ming China? China was the most sophisticated state in the world in the early fifteenth century. Little is known of the vast population that worked on the land producing tea, rice and cotton. However, we do know about the emperors and empresses, princes and princesses that ruled the imperial and regional courts. We have spectacular portraits showing the rulers and paintings which portray life in their palaces. Their courts were furnished with finely worked lacquer, exquisite gold, porcelain and jade. They shared collections of paintings, calligraphy and books. In the Buddhist, Daoist temples and mosques ceremonies and services were conducted which were recorded in fabulous paintings and texts. The early fifteenth century was a time of building the Forbidden City in Beijing and sending treasure ships around the world to the Middle East and Africa. These contacts made China cosmopolitan full of foreign goods, people and ideas. This lecture will bring this period of history to life. It is linked to the major exhibition at the British Museum curated by Craig Clunas and Jessica Harrison-Hall (18 September- 2014 to 5 January 2015).   Jessica Harrison-Hall is Curator of the Sir Percival David Collection and Chinese Ceramics and Vietnamese Art at the British Museum. She has curated special exhibitions on Chinese ceramics, export ceramics, textiles and Vietnamese war art, the permanent gallery of the Sir Percival David Collection of Chinese Ceramics at the British Museum and China: Journey to the East--A UK Touring Exhibition . Her publications include Catalogue of Late Yuan and Ming Ceramics in the British Museum (2001), Vietnam Behind the Lines (2002), Pocket Timeline of China (2007), C hinese Ceramics: Highlights of the Sir Percival David Collection (with Regina Krahl, 2009, translated into Chinese 2013) and Passion for Porcelain (with L.

She is currently working on a major AHRC research project 'Ming: Courts and Contacts 1400-1450' and the exhibition Ming: 50 Years that Changed China with Professor Craig Clunas, which has opened at the British Museum on 18 September and closes on 5 January 2015.   back to page index     \"Ming: Beyond Porcelain\"   Yu-ping Luk (Victoria & Albert Museum)  Winter Olympia Art & Antiques Fair   London, UK  4 November 2014   [from Asian Art in London , 10/27/14]   back to page index     \"Yongle to Yongzheng: Imperial Chinese Carpets\"   Michael Franses (independent scholar, Doha)   in the conference \"Stromata: : The Carpet as Artifact, Concept and Metaphor in Literature,  Science and the Arts\"  Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz Max-Planck-Institut  Florence,  Italy  3-5 November 2014   [from H-Arthist , 10/27/14]   back to page index     \"Not Imperial, But Simply Beautiful\"   Ni Yibin (independent scholar)  Sir Michael Butler Memorial Lecture  Oriental Ceramic Society  London, UK  5 November 2014   [from OCS , 10/24/14]   Over the last thirty-odd years, the porcelains produced during the so-called transitional period (roughly, 1620 - 80) in China has become much better known to, and even surprised, the world through a series of exhibitions held in Asia, the European continent, the US, and the UK and the Butler Collections have figured prominently. Sir Michael Butler is recognized for his contribution to the \"fine-dating\" of this batch of porcelains and he coined the term such as the \"high-transitional (1634--44)\" and identified the unique characteristics of the pots manufactured during the previously \"unknown\" Shunzhi reign (1644-61). The lecture will focus on the best areas of Sir Michael's work and highlight the relevant examples in the collection while showing how the Jingdezhen potters adapted to the diminishing imperial patronage by appealing to the growing domestic and export markets with their brilliant creativity set free from the court bureaucracy.   Yibin Ni obtained his MA and PhD at University College London and studied Chinese art at the School of Oriental and African Studies.

Confronting representations from different parts of the globe, the discussions invite us to engage with unfamiliar contexts and global structures of environmental conflict. The talks hold ruined and relinquished landscapes produced in different temporal and spatial locales in light of each other, to investigate landscape as a mode of seeing and site of control and resistance, intertwined with social and economic power structures.   Erasing Presence, Imagining Absence     Tong Lam (University of Toronto), \"Gated Precarity: A Post-Socialist Forbidden City in Global China\"  Xiancun, a semi-demolished urban slum in central Guangzhou fenced by ameliorative propaganda hoardings, conjures up a different imagery of the gated community. It is however an eyesore to Chinese authorities and urban planners, and home to many migrant workers subjugated to precarious living conditions. This talk analyzes the symbolic significance of Xiancun in Chinas recent history and in the wider global context. It also reflects on the challenge of creating visual images of urban ruins and slums in a world that is increasingly dominated by spectacle.   Jason McGrath (University of Minnesota), \"The Sinification of Nihilism?\"  This talk addresses, on the one hand, the nihilism intrinsic to capitalism as described by Marshall Berman in his reading of Marx and Engels, and relates it to Tong Lam's images of China under the current development boom. On the other, it will address a quite different \"nihilism\" implied by ecocritical thought on the \"late anthropocene.\"   Jonathan Maskit (Denison University), \"Industrialism, Non-Sites, and the Temporarily Permanent\"  Contemporary products, even those seemingly most permanent, are all now temporary. Industrialism has always transformed natural places into non-sites, e.g., clear-cut former forests. Contemporary hyper-industrialism now increasingly converts produced sites into non-sites, e.g., abandoned buildings or neighborhoods. These spectral non-sites become visible in art, which lets us see them not as contingent aberrations in a progressive narrative, but as inevitable interruptions that reflect and materialize tensions in the social order.   Joy Sperling (Denison University), \"The Female Embodiment of an Enchanted State: Women and Visual Culture in interwar New Mexico\"  This talk argues that a multi-ocular, multi-perspectival, and sometimes refracted glance at New Mexicos interwar tourist landscape reveals how the narrative of New Mexico was redrafted from a land of cattle ranchers and outlaws into a feminized embodiment of the Enchanted State living in a suspended imaginary of its ancient native past. This new narrative lodged itself so deeply within New Mexicos consciousness that it still survives today.     Landscapes Made, Unmade and Remade     Chunchun Ting (University of Chicago), \"Redefining the Local Lifeworld: Documentary Filmmaking and Political Empowerment in Hong Kongs Inner City\"  This talk examines the changing meanings of inner-city neighborhoods in post-handover Hong Kong. The social perceptions of these neighborhoods reveal societys attitude toward redevelopment, the collective past, the urban poor, and Hong Kong itself as a city and a community. Focusing on an art/activist group that collaborates with evictees, I observe a gradual shift in the discourse of urban preservation from cultural heritage to housing rights and the communal ownership of neighborhoods.   Joanna Grabski (Denison University), \"Incongruous Landscapes: Making Dakar from Inside and Beyond\"  This talk explores notions of spatial, temporal, and visual incongruity as they relate to themes of progress, development and urbanization. I draw upon two sets of images representing paradigmatic urban registers: Dakar's streets, markets, architecture and topography. These include artistic propositions interpreting the city of Dakar by Cheikh Ndiaye and Viy Diba, and images from my documentary film footage on Colobane market and its neighborhood, rendering a most incongruent landscape fueled by activity from inside and beyond Dakar.   Julia Adeney Thomas (University of Notre Dame; Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study), \"The Shared Landscapes of Asia: How an Exhibition Found Space for Japan's War Memories\"  This talk contrasts two exhibitions, both at the Yokohama Museum of Art, one in 1995 and the other in 2004. In the first exhibition, Photography in the 1940s , Japanese aggression was occluded; in the second, through a mixed-media display of landscapes, inventive curators found another point of view that could reveal atrocity while creating space for mutual understanding. The seemingly most benign of art genres was brought to bear on a violent, troubled past, and proved capable of providing a better line of sight.   Catherine Stuer (Denison University), \"On the Freedom of Ruins\"  This talk explores how the figure of the ruin, so-called master-trope of modern reflexivity, shares structural affinities with the past trace in imperial China. Both medium for nostalgic fetishization of the past and for symbolic contestation of the present, I compare both figures to investigate the historical concurrence and aftereffects of Euro-American and traditional Chinese modalities of ruin-representation. I focus here on photographic landscapes produced by early 20th century colonial explorers and local critics of urban destruction in China.     back to page index             Last     modified 3 Nov 2014.
