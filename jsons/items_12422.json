Stern School of Business students volunteered their time and energy in Costa Rica during winter intersession as part of Stern International Volunteers, a program that complements the school's four-course, social impact sequence. Our Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars took a January intersession trip to Peru, where they lived with host families and helped tackle health and ecological issues by installing clean-burning stoves, building bathrooms at schools, and planting trees. The examples of how our students work and learn globally are endless.

Rebecca says, \u201cI had always wanted to live in Madrid, so the summer program seemed the obvious choice for where I should go abroad, to fulfill requirements for my major while gaining fluency.\u201d When NYU opened a site in Buenos Aires, Rebecca hit upon a way to integrate all of her interests. She applied for and received a Dean\u2019s Undergraduate Research grant to expand her research while abroad. She says, \u201cI was interested in the parallels of Buenos Aires to New York in terms of the heavy immigration both sustained in the 19th century. I used my time abroad to conduct firsthand research about Irish immigration to Argentina. When I immersed myself in the community, I was regaled with stories and given books and photos to take with me.\u201d This form of on-site research was a different experience for Rebecca, as she was able to compare her archival findings to the oral histories she collected.      Through the summer program in Dublin, she continued her research on immigration, all of which now forms the foundation of her senior honors thesis, which she will present at a conference on campus in New York. She says, \u201cI love New York, but my mental map of what constitutes \u2018home\u2019 has extended to include other places in the world.\u201d                                                NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
