Tracing contemporary fascinations with the urban margins back to the eighteenth century, the course will consider social epistemologies of coded and decoded behavior, slumming and passing, jargon, cant, and slang. Of key interest will be the critical turn in subcultures and post-subcultures studies since the 1970s, a turn towards questions of fashion, style, and youth culture as sites of resistance and resignification.
