Undergraduate life at NYU is made up of a unique combination of experiences that stem from the vast learning opportunities inside and outside the classroom, the rich culture and excitement of New York City, and numerous options for international experiences through the University's global programs. Students will have countless ways to connect with other students in their schools and classrooms, in residence halls, student clubs, and while on the NYU campus.        Unlike its peers, NYU is characterized by its diversity of disciplines. There is no single intellectual experience. The varied programs of study adhere to a common expectation for high achievement, engaging world challenges through diverse academic journeys. Undergraduate courses offered range from chemistry and economics to iPhone programming and Politics &amp; Society in Iran. All courses follow the same high standard of expectation: pursuing the most superior level of academic enterprise and providing diverse, innovative opportunities for learning.            Undergraduate Programs        Undergraduate education at NYU is rooted in a strong liberal arts foundation. The University's undergraduate programs offer distinct options and paths of study, whether you are pursuing a rigorous and extensive education in liberal arts or a liberal arts education with more distinctive professional training.        New York City                                                    College of Arts and Science                               College of Arts and Science provides a premier liberal arts education by laying a foundation of general education and skills on which to build specialized study in one or more of the arts and sciences, involving students in research, offering them opportunities for professional education, making full use of NYC and developing cultural competence and the potential for leadership in a global world.                                                              College of Dentistry                               The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two academic programs of study for Dental Hygiene : the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene and the Associate in Applied Science Degree Program in Dental Hygiene . Both programs prepare students for careers in dental hygiene. The office is responsible for dental hygiene continuing education and dental hygiene alumni events.                                                              College of Nursing                               The College of Nursing educates future nursing professionals who exemplify the highest standards of excellence in research, teaching/learning and practice for a global society.                                                              Gallatin School of Individualized Study                               B.A. and M.A students at Gallatin design their own individualized program of study. This program combines courses taken in the various schools of NYU with independent studies, internships and Gallatin\u2019s own small-scale interdisciplinary seminars. Gallatin provides students with a unique combination of program flexibility matched with academic rigor and the guidance and support of extraordinary advisers.

Liberal Studies Program                               Liberal Studies (LS) provides students with small, seminar format classes led by a teaching faculty in a writing-intensive great works curriculum that serves as a sound liberal arts foundation for study in all of NYU's baccalaureate programs   The program in Global Liberal Studies (GLS) is a bachelor's degree program that features core course work in the liberal arts with a focus on great works in a global context. All GLS students spend their junior year abroad at an NYU site. Graduates of GLS will be world citizens, proficient in a foreign language, engaged in international cultures, and well prepared to enter the world of work or for admission to professional and graduate schools.                                                               Polytechnic School of Engineering                               The NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering is located in neighboring downtown Brooklyn. The NYU School of Engineering is one of the nation's most comprehensive institutions of engineering, applied science, and technology\u2014and is the second oldest in the United States. Students may directly or explore our dual degree program in science and engineering jointly offered through the College of Arts and Science.                                                              School of Continuing and Professional Studies                               The School of Continuing and Professional Studies houses the Paul McGhee Division , an intimate liberal arts college environment for both mature first-time degree seekers and those returning after a lapse of time to complete deferred undergraduate studies in applied business and professional fields, the humanities, and the social sciences.   In addition, SCPS houses the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism, and Sports Management and the Schack Institute of Real Estate , both of which prepare traditional age students for industry leadership through distinctive academic and professional studies that integrate theory, practice, and internship and mentoring opportunities, within the general NYU undergraduate experience.                                                                Silver School of Social Work                               The Silver School of Social Work educates future leaders with the analytic and human relations skills necessary to create positive change in the domains of education, healthcare, human rights, policy, law, human services, and other fields. Through direct engagement with the most pressing social problems in today's complex urban environments, social work combines service, research, and scholarship to advance the cause of social justice and promote the ideals of a humane society.                                                              Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development                               NYU Steinhardt advances knowledge, creativity, and innovation at the critical crossroads of human learning, culture, development, and well-being. All undergraduate programs combine inquiry in the liberal arts and sciences, mastery of a specific field of study, opportunities for cross-cultural study, and applied learning, internship, and other fieldwork experiences with partner organizations throughout the city. Undergraduate degree programs lead to the B.F.A. in studio art, B.Mus. in music performance, music business, music education, and music technology, and B.S. in applied psychology, educational theatre, teacher education, media studies, and health, including nutrition, food studies, public health, and communicative sciences and disorders.                                                              Tisch School of the Arts                               Tisch School of the Arts provides a template for training artists inside a research university, emphasizing a learn-by-doing pedagogy, risk taking, collaboration, partnerships with New York City professional communities and the value of a liberal arts education.                    NYU Abu Dhabi     NYU Abu Dhabi consists of a highly selective liberal arts and science college (including engineering), and a world center for advanced research and scholarship \u2013 all fully integrated with each other and connected to NYU in New York. The New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai campuses form the backbone with faculty and students from each campus spending &quot;semesters away&quot; at one or more of the numerous study abroad sites NYU maintains on five continents.       NYU Abu Dhabi            NYU Shanghai     NYU Shanghai students spend at least five semesters in Shanghai and at least one semester elsewhere in NYU's global network.
