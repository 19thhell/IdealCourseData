Description       Identity: the ways in which we see ourselves; the ways in which others see us; the dynamic relationship between these two seemingly distinct and often irreconcilable poles is the underlying theme of this first-year research seminar. We focus specifically on the ways in which we create, build, rebuild, and live our racial and ethnic identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? We employ historical, sociological, and cultural lenses. Several short written assignments help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about racial identity in a longer final research paper.

Description       What is home? Where is home? How do we define home? What does it mean to be home? In this course, we explore the concepts of home and homeland as they relate to geographical place, birth, language, and cultural identity. We read texts by and about exiles, \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and expatriates in order to think about the departure from home, the loss of home, and the processes by which people make new homes and maintain relationships to their native lands. Does the ability or inability to return home affect one\u2019s perceptions of home? Is the idea of home an imagined fantasy or is it grounded in concrete places and experiences? We also examine past and contemporary practices of defining homes and homelands in relation to outsiders. How, in other words, are ideas of home and homeland exclusionary? Students write various analytic essays that address these questions and develop individual projects for a longer research essay. The texts for this course may include the writings of Edward Said, Salman Rushdie, and Eva Hoffman, articles about immigration policy and Homeland Security, the PBS documentary Homeland: Immigration in America , and clips from the recent television show Homeland .

Description       Identity: the ways in which we see ourselves; the ways in which others see us; the dynamic relationship between these two seemingly distinct and often irreconcilable poles is the underlying theme of this first-year research seminar. We focus specifically on the ways in which we create, build, rebuild, and live our racial and ethnic identities in constant dialogue with contemporary American societal constructions of race and ethnicity. Questions we explore include: what is race? Is it immutable? How do we know it when we see it? How is it distinct from ethnicity? What is gained and/or lost by considering or not considering race today? In what ways do other facets of identity, for example gender, sexuality, and class inform, challenge, reconstruct, or deconstruct our racial identities? We employ historical, sociological, and cultural lenses. Several short written assignments help students formulate, research, and respond to questions about racial identity in a longer final research paper. Texts include fiction, plays, theory and criticism including, Junot Diaz\u2019s\u00a0 The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao \u00a0, Edward Said\u2019s\u00a0 Orientalism \u00a0, Mark Anthony Neal's\u00a0 Soul Babies \u00a0and B.D.

Description       What is home? Where is home? How do we define home? What does it mean to be home? In this course, we explore the concepts of home and homeland as they relate to geographical place, birth, language, and cultural identity. We read texts by and about exiles, \u00e9migr\u00e9s, and expatriates in order to think about the departure from home, the loss of home, and the processes by which people make new homes and maintain relationships to their native lands. Does the ability or inability to return home affect one\u2019s perceptions of home? Is the idea of home an imagined fantasy or is it grounded in concrete places and experiences? We also examine past and contemporary practices of defining homes and homelands in relation to outsiders. How, in other words, are ideas of home and homeland exclusionary? Students write various analytic essays that address these questions and develop individual projects for a longer research essay. The texts for this course may include the writings of Edward Said, Salman Rushdie, and Eva Hoffman, articles about immigration policy and Homeland Security, the PBS documentary Homeland: Immigration in America , and clips from the recent television show Homeland .

Description       Modern nations and peoples frequently seek their origin and inspiration in societies that came before. They often gain from their predecessors a sense of history and cultural identity and use that past to shape contemporary relationships with other peoples, institutions, or landscapes. Ancient cultures, too, established intimate\u2014and often highly politicized\u2014connections to their own cultural history through monuments, literature, histories, and mythologies, often with seemingly little regard for what we think of as \u201cthe truth.\u201d This course investigates the idea of the past (mythological and historical) in the shaping of Greek and Roman identities, the influence that existing monuments and landscapes had on classical ideas of what came before, and the use of oral, written, and visual material to communicate and perpetuate certain legacies. In addition to looking at the ways that ancient cultures used their own past to shape a cultural identity, we will also look at the ways in which ancient texts and archaeological remains have been employed in the shaping of modern national identities in Europe, Turkey, and Egypt. For their semester projects, students are invited to apply the questions we encounter in class to a historical period, political context, or geographical region that interests them. Course readings and central monuments may include the following: Stuart Hall, Anthony Smith, Jan Assmann, Andreas Huyssen, Homer, Herodotus, Pindar, the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, the Parthenon, the Great Altar at Pergamon, Virgil, the Ara Pacis.
