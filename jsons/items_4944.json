This region follows the Andes mountain chain from Colombia through Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, to Chile and NW Argentina. The Institute draws upon the CLACS commitment to Quechua language training , the depth of expertise on the region among CLACS Affiliated Faculty at NYU, and the large number of Andeanists at other NYC-area institutions, as well as the presence of a vibrant Andeanist and Andean community around the city.  The Andean Institute brings together faculty, students, research, academic debate, and outreach resources. It also hosts colloquia, conferences, and Andean-related events , as well as promotes courses about the Andes. The Institute is proud to offer Quechua language courses , and also sponsors a monthly Quechua language conversation night which is open to the public.  Through this website, the Institute fosters a virtual community for the diffusion of new research, providing a space for dynamic dialogue. We are proud that the Andean Institute connects communities within the NYC area, and serves as a bridge between the NYC region and Andean countries.
