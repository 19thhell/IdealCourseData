It is the fastest growing industry and has become an indispensable element of everyday life of the general public. Cellular phones are the key enabling devices and have experienced exponential growth over the last three decades. There are currently billions of cell phone users worldwide. In addition, wireless local area networks are currently poised to supplement or replace wired networks. Many new applications, including wireless sensor networks, automated highways, smart homes, and remote telemedicine, are also emerging. There is no doubt that this is the wireless personal communications world.   This course will cover the underlying principles of wireless communications and practical systems including the fundamentals of science and technology of wireless communications. Topics in this course include Radio Signal Propagation, Impairments and Mitigations, Interference-limited Communications, Frequency Reuse and Cellular Structure, Traffic Analysis and Trunking Loss, Multiple-access and Air Interface (FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, OFDMA), Building blocks and essential functions (modulations and coding) of wireless networks, and Standardized Wireless Systems (AMPS, GSM, WCDMA, LTE, WiMax, and Wifi).
