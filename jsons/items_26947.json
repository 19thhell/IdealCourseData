These courses comprise creative work including choreography and performance. Choreography is approached through exploration of resources, including improvisation, use of ideas, knowledge of forms, development of craft. First-year students receive weekly assignments directed toward specific problems and dance elements. Second-year work develops with an emphasis on the relationship between manipulation of musical phrases and choreography as well as the completion of dances. Work begun in all composition classes may be performed in studio theatre concerts. Other performance opportunities derive from repertory classes, performance workshops, and major dance works choreographed by faculty and guest choreographers that are assigned and also from student and faculty choreography pursued independently outside of course work.
