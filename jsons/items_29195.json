Note : You should consult with your department chair about acceptable reasons and best practices for teaching remotely.   This site offers a list of services, resources, and approaches that you may wish to use to support your remote instruction efforts. The chart below provides an overview of the technologies that can be used to augment or replace classroom activities in the event that remote instruction is necessary.   Some of the tools listed are appropriate for use in synchronous (\u201creal-time\u201d) instruction, while others support asynchronous (\u201cnon-real-time\u201d) instruction. Please keep in mind, however, that coordinating a live, remote lecture using any technology can present a variety of technical challenges for instructors and students. These include different types of internet connections, periods of Internet slowness, and disruptions to wireless service at the time of need. For these reasons, in the event of an emergency asynchronous approaches are often preferable.   Whatever approach you prefer to take, it is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the available technology before needs arise.   In the event that remote instruction becomes necessary, please know that NYU IT will strive to keep production services related to communication and instruction up and running. Also, where possible, computing labs will be kept open.   Finally, please know that the University stands ready to provide faculty with support for using the tools listed below. For information about how to access this support, please see the \u201cSupport\u201d notice on the right-hand side of this page.

Note : You should consult with your department chair about acceptable reasons and best practices for teaching remotely.   This site offers a list of services, resources, and approaches that you may wish to use to support your remote instruction efforts. The chart below provides an overview of the technologies that can be used to augment or replace classroom activities in the event that remote instruction is necessary.   Some of the tools listed are appropriate for use in synchronous (\u201creal-time\u201d) instruction, while others support asynchronous (\u201cnon-real-time\u201d) instruction. Please keep in mind, however, that coordinating a live, remote lecture using any technology can present a variety of technical challenges for instructors and students. These include different types of internet connections, periods of Internet slowness, and disruptions to wireless service at the time of need. For these reasons, in the event of an emergency asynchronous approaches are often preferable.   Whatever approach you prefer to take, it is strongly recommended that you familiarize yourself with the available technology before needs arise.   In the event that remote instruction becomes necessary, please know that NYU IT will strive to keep production services related to communication and instruction up and running. Also, where possible, computing labs will be kept open.   Finally, please know that the University stands ready to provide faculty with support for using the tools listed below. For information about how to access this support, please see the \u201cSupport\u201d notice on the right-hand side of this page.
