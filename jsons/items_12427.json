How did an international community transform a military research project into the Internet we use today?       Interdisciplinary and Flexible   Answering these and related questions requires a firm foundation in science and engineering on the one hand, and humanities and social sciences on the other. Following individualized courses of study and collaboration with faculty mentors, Science and Technology Studies majors dig beneath the headlines to understand the relations among science, technology, and society.   The Science and Technology Studies curriculum falls into four broad categories: general education (40 credits), science or engineering courses (28 credits), science and technology studies courses (34 credits), and free electives (18 credits). A student can combine a core of scientific or technical courses along with the analysis of those fields from an STS perspectives. The free electives are used as a student pleases, either to increase the depth of the science/engineering core, to take advantage of cross-school minors with NYU, or to study abroad.   Foundation for the Future   For students who plan to continue their education beyond the bachelor&#39;s degree, Science and Technology Studies makes an excellent preprofessional degree.      There are more than twice the number of applicants to medical schools as there are available seats. The MCAT exam, for entrance into medical school, is expanding its scope, and students will be expected to understand more than the science of medicine. Using Science and Technology Studies as a prehealth degree gives you the flexibility to do just that.    For students heading to law school, Science and Technology Studies is an attractive prelaw option. Lawyers with expertise in science or engineering are in demand to practice cases with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Lawyers are also increasingly asked to deal with scientific and technical matters in their practice, and the STS degree helps students prepare to understand and explain technical matters that come before them.     Not all Science and Technology students go on to law or medical school -- they are also qualified to work in public health, conduct laboratory research, work as a science journalist, or pursue advanced study in the history and philosophy of science and technology.

These scholars use a variety of interdisciplinary approaches to investigate critical issues of the development, meaning, practice, and social significance of science. Their work is supported by several different schools and departments at NYU. The new Science and Society Minor brings together their teaching, and research projects are discussed with city-wide scholars at the NYC History of Science Working Group.

How did an international community transform a military research project into the Internet we use today?       Interdisciplinary and Flexible   Answering these and related questions requires a firm foundation in science and engineering on the one hand, and humanities and social sciences on the other. Following individualized courses of study and collaboration with faculty mentors, Science and Technology Studies majors dig beneath the headlines to understand the relations among science, technology, and society.   The Science and Technology Studies curriculum falls into four broad categories: general education (40 credits), science or engineering courses (28 credits), science and technology studies courses (34 credits), and free electives (18 credits). A student can combine a core of scientific or technical courses along with the analysis of those fields from an STS perspectives. The free electives are used as a student pleases, either to increase the depth of the science/engineering core, to take advantage of cross-school minors with NYU, or to study abroad.   Foundation for the Future   For students who plan to continue their education beyond the bachelor&#39;s degree, Science and Technology Studies makes an excellent preprofessional degree.      There are more than twice the number of applicants to medical schools as there are available seats. The MCAT exam, for entrance into medical school, is expanding its scope, and students will be expected to understand more than the science of medicine. Using Science and Technology Studies as a prehealth degree gives you the flexibility to do just that.    For students heading to law school, Science and Technology Studies is an attractive prelaw option. Lawyers with expertise in science or engineering are in demand to practice cases with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Lawyers are also increasingly asked to deal with scientific and technical matters in their practice, and the STS degree helps students prepare to understand and explain technical matters that come before them.     Not all Science and Technology students go on to law or medical school -- they are also qualified to work in public health, conduct laboratory research, work as a science journalist, or pursue advanced study in the history and philosophy of science and technology.

For college program applicants, click here for Arthur O. Eve HEOP and CSTEP admission information and Financial Aid deadlines.         New York State Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP)       Sponsored by the New York State Department of Education, the Arthur O. Eve Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) at NYU is designed to assist students who are residents of New York State who are academically and educationally disadvantaged. In addition to financial assistance, students in the program receive supportive services including counseling and tutoring to help ensure their success. Students must meet academic and family income guidelines to be eligible, and must attend a six-week summer program prior to the start of their freshman year. No special application is required for HEOP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.    Read More HEOP Information         Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program (CSTEP)   CSTEP is a NYU program for New York State residents underrepresented in business, law, science, and health-related programs who do not qualify for the Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP). CSTEP students receive the same academic and counseling services that HEOP students receive, and participate in the same six-week summer program before their freshman year. No special application is required for CSTEP consideration, and New York State residents are automatically reviewed for eligibility during our normal application review process.   Read More CSTEP Information           Middle School and High School Program    The Science and Technology Program (STEP) and the Building Excellence in Science and Technology (BEST)* program at New York University (NYU) is an innovative pre-college enrichment program for talented and motivated middle and high school students in New York City. Our goal is to (1) prepare our students to be competitive so that they are accepted into a selective college of their choice and (2) encourage and increase the number of historically under-represented minority groups in the science, technology, engineering, math (STEM) careers, health-related fields and licensed professions.    *BEST is a joint program with STEP, which is specifically designed to serve students attending middle school and high school in Brooklyn schools located in District 13.
