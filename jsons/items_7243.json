Note: This course fulfills 4 units of the Interdisciplinary Seminar and the Humanities foundation requirements.          Course Description          It is often claimed of Paris that the color blindness of its citizens and politics created a haven for African American expatriates. It is certainly true that some of the most important political, philosophical, literary and artistic works of African American culture arise from an encounter with the City of Light, but contained within these works is not &quot;racelessness&quot; but a pronounced sense and articulation of what it means to be a Black American.   From the written works of Harlem Renaissance writers Langston Hughes, Claude McKay and Countee Cullen that fomented the Negritude movement, to the performances of Josephine Baker, to the art of Henry Ossawa Tanner and Beauford Delaney, to the music of jazz musicians Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Bill Coleman, to the political philosophies and writings of W.E.B Dubois and James Baldwin, Paris's influence on the creation of African American culture has been profound. Less noted is the degree to which the African American presence in Paris influenced international art and political thought, from the use of African cubism among European artists to the shaping of the philosophies of thinkers like Sarte, Camus and de Beauvoir.   We will focus on Paris as a site of exchange\u2014as an intersection through which pass influential ideas, forms and actions. We will consider the degree to which the encounter with Paris paradoxically made African American writers and artists more aware of and intent upon defining and articulating their Americanness, and finding in it a foundation for increased political activism and shaping of a Pan-African sensibility and community. This class will examine the literature, art, food, geographies and politics of African American expatriates in Paris, paying particular attention to the ways that the view from another shore shaped political thought and activism arising from a deepened awareness of national and international identity that Paris inspired.   Trips to explore the richness of African American life in Paris will include walking tours of &quot;Black Paris,&quot; visits to the Louvre and other museums that hold African American art, restaurants that were centers of African American culture in Paris, and even gravesites where expatriates are buried, and which raise crucial questions about the meanings of &quot;home.&quot; Students will have plenty of time to use the ideas and works in the course to create their projects and pursue their own ideas.

The NYU Paris academic center is located within proximity of Paris' most renowned cultural, artistic, and academic institutions. The resident director, administrative staff, and faculty advise students during their stay in Paris. During the summer session, all undergraduates are housed in student residences in lively and historic neighborhoods. Experience the City of Light with its cultural richness, history, and vibrant daily life through this intellectually and aesthetically stimulating study abroad program.          ACADEMICS   The undergraduate program in Paris provides a rich introduction to historic and present-day France through classroom studies and diverse extracurricular activities. Intensive French language classes, offered at all levels, are taught by instructors with native proficiency. Faculty who teach French civilization courses (offered in English or in French), provide exceptional academic instruction. Courses include field trips to culturally significant sites in the city.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students must stay in NYU provided housing. Participants in the summer undergraduate program are housed in a residence hall in a lively neighborhood close to the historic neighborhoods of the Marais and the Bastille, and within easy commuting distance to the NYU academic center.   All classes are held at the centrally located NYU Paris Center, comprised of classrooms, a student lounge, a lecture hall, and computer terminals for student use. Students are also strongly recommended to bring their own laptop computers. The NYU Paris staff helps students make the most of their summer in Paris. Full-time staff includes the Resident Director of NYU Paris, Academic and Student Life Staff, and an on-site Counselor.           EXCURSIONS      To enhance students' academic experience, NYU Paris hosts several lectures throughout the summer session that bring together French and Francophone artists, scholars, and activists. Cultural activities such as neighborhood walking tours, visits to world famous museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and attendance at numerous ballet, concert, and theatre performances are scheduled to complement the academic program. Excursions further complete the cultural calendar: activities planned for 2015 may include day trips to Chartres, Giverny, and the D-Day beaches in Normandy.

This course explores photography from the 1830s to the present day, emphasizing style and subject matter (rather than technical processes) in the work of the major photographers. We will consider how photography has enlarged and affected our vision and knowledge of the world, and how photography has influenced and been influenced by other modes of artistic expression (theatre, film, literature, the fine arts). In addition, we will consider photography as it is defined through a variety of means, from political documentary to fashion photography to advertising. Visits to photography exhibits in and outside of Paris will form an integral part of this course. Sample syllabus .

The second half of the course focuses on changes in the art world during the first half of the 20th century, with particular attention on the dada movement, surrealism, abstract expressionism, and other movements that influenced and changed major art capitals of the world. Field trips include visits to the Orsay Museum with its superb reconstruction of 19th-century aesthetic life, the 17th-century private palace that now houses the Picasso collection, and the incomparable Louvre, among others.

Below is information on best practices on how to be secure in and around campus.                                                  NYU Protects Them                                 With uniformed security officers who are on duty 24x7x365   Our emergency number 212-998-2222   Emergency Call boxes are located throughout the main campus   Green light buildings are staffed 24 hours a day by Public Safety Officers   Safe Havens \u2014 approximately 75 in number serve as places to go for an NYU community member in distress   Transportation Services \u2014 provides free transportation from residence halls to the main campus. Safe Ride Program exists from 12 midnight to 7:00am. Call 212-992-VANS for more information.                                                                Safety in the City                                 NYU students are statistically safer than the average city resident, who are safer than most other large city residents. However, this is a major city and is not without criminal activity.   Students need to be aware of their surroundings, walk with a positive bearing. If you use an electronic device to listen to music, keep the volume to a reasonable level.   Trust your instincts; if a situation makes you feel uncomfortable, get away as quickly as possible. Make casual eye contact with the person making you feel uncomfortable just to let them know you are aware of their presence.   Travel in groups of two or more (the buddy system)   Let a roommate or friend know where you are going and when you plan on returning.   Be aware of pickpocket situations \u2014 crowded areas e.g. subways, concerts, etc.   Use Gear Guards (available through Public Safety) to protect back packs, etc.   Men - carry wallets in front pants pocket.   Women - use bags, pocketbooks etc. that zipper well; keep pocketbooks on your lap when in restaurants etc. Avoid the backs of chairs or under the table, carry your bag close to your body, tucked in the bend of your elbow. Avoid bags that clasp or snap shut.   Beware of scam artists offering big returns for little or no money (often referred to as good faith money). If it seems too good to be true - IT IS.   The best time to use ATMs is during the daylight hours. Use bank affiliated ATMs whenever possible.   Avoid carrying large amounts of cash; avoid counting or displaying money on the street.   Minimize the number of credit cards carried.   Carry money for emergencies e.g. cab fare, quarters for phone calls   When traveling, plan your route ahead of time, know how to get to where you are going.   Subway stops with lit green globes are open 24 hours a day, red globes means entry is closed, red over white coloring is a metro-card only entrance. It is always a good idea to have a metro-card with a sufficient balance.   On subways \u2014 where possible stay in the token booth area until your train arrives   On the platform \u2014 look for a black and white striped board. That is where the car with the conductor will stop. You can also ride in the first car where the train operator is located.   When entering a subway car look around. Does anyone make you feel uneasy, if so, move.   Try sitting in the middle of the subway car away from the doorway.   Keep chains and jewelry hidden. Turn gemstones in toward your palms.   On the street \u2014 Travel well-lit and populated areas. Avoid &quot;short cuts.&quot; If you must travel alone late at night, call someone at your destination to let them know you are coming and how long it will take you to arrive.   If a car approaches you and asks for directions, speak with the occupants at a safe distance no matter what.   If you feel you are being followed cross the street, if that person follows you again, recross the street. If you're still being followed look for a open store etc., begin to run, call out &quot;HELP!!&quot;, or call out to someone on the street as if you know them.                                                                Safety if You're Going Out to a Bar or Club                                 Do not go out alone. Always go out in groups of 2 or more and travel on well-lit and populated streets.   Tell your friends/roommates if you\u2019re leaving, with whom, where you\u2019re planning to go and when you\u2019ll see them back at home.   Do not accept open drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) from others who you do not know or do not trust; this includes drinks that come in a glass.   Never leave your drink unattended or turn your back on your table.   Do not drink from open beverage sources like punch bowls, pitchers or tubs.   Keep your eyes and ears open; if friends appear to be &quot;too intoxicated&quot; for what they have consumed, leave the party or club immediately, and return home or seek medical attention. Do not return to the club or party!   Be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times.   Know where you need to go and the safest way to get there.   Trust your instincts: If you sense something is wrong, get away from the situation.                                                                Safety on Campus                                 When in the library and study hall, dining facilities, etc. keep wallets, cell phones and laptops with you. These are the type of property that are commonly reported stolen. Crimes of Opportunity can be minimized by safeguarding your property. Buy a laptop security cable and use it.   OPERATION ID - A joint program with the NYPD to register smart phones, tablets, laptops and other small electronic devices. If the device is lost or stolen, and turned into the NYPD, the owner can be contacted to reclaim their property. No cost to register your devices!     In your residence, always close and lock your door even if leave for just a minute. Insist your roommate(s) do the same.   Establish rules with your roommate(s) regarding visitors (above and beyond NYU Housing rules).   Be wary of people striking up a conversation with you in Washington Square Park or on the street. Be especially aware of people looking for a place to stay even if they seem very nice and harmless.

The University is committed to the safety and well-being of its students, faculty, and staff, and we strive to ensure the safety of the campus community by employing a large, well-trained, 24/7 corps of public safety officers; by making sure the grounds are well lit, well patrolled, and well traveled; by offering education and guidance so that members of the community can effectively contribute to their own safety; and by cultivating and maintaining a close, excellent relationship with the New York City Police department and New York City governmental authorities. New York University is located in one of the safest areas of the New York City, the safest large city in the U.S., and our campus has a reputation for attentiveness to security and \u2013 particularly given its geographical size, location, and population size \u2013 for a relatively low amount of crime, particularly serious crime . Still, crime does occur on and around our campus, as it does on all college campuses, and we are constantly striving to improve campus security and emphasizing the importance of incorporating safety into one\u2019s daily routine. Campus crime statistics are updated daily and are available 24 hours a day on the Public Safety web page (http://www.nyu.edu/public.safety/policies/crimestatistics.html) and at Public Safety\u2019s Central Command Center, which is located in the center of campus at 14 Washington Place.   Our annual campus security and fire safety report are published every fall and, are available online and at  various locations around campus.                                                                Who provides campus security                               The NYU Public Safety Department is the principal provider of security. Our department includes more than 300 uniformed NYS state certified Public Safety officers and 20 mid-senior level supervisors who serve the campus community 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The University Public Safety Department, often working in conjunction with other campus offices, offer crime prevention and security programs, including training in theft prevention, alcohol/drug awareness, sexual assault prevention, and personal defense. Transportation services, emergency phones, a safe haven program, green light buildings and an  escort service are also part of campus safety programming.                                                              Residence Hall Safety                               At least one uniformed Public Safety Officer is assigned to the entrance of every residence hall on a 24/7 basis to check every person entering the building and maintain a safe environment. The Department works closely with the Residential Education Department, its staff, and NYU\u2019s 300+ resident assistants (RA\u2019s) and 50 Peer Educators to offer special programs on safety as well as on assault, theft, and rape prevention; those programs begin as students arrive for Welcome Week. The residence halls are equipped with fire and life-safety systems , and fire evacuation drills are conducted five times per year. Students are issued keys at check-in, and every hall has established procedures and guidelines to help ensure the safety of its residents. All secondary hall entrances are locked 24 hours a day. Visitor and guest policies vary from hall to hall, but all hall guests must register.                                                              Public Safety Collaborations                               Public Safety works closely with all the members of the Wellness Exchange, particularly the student health center and residential education, to ensure the health and well being of all NYU students. Through the 24/7 Wellness Exchange hotline, students can speak to a counselor regarding a health/mental health matter and the Wellness Exchange frequently involves Public Safety where it is appropriate to handle situations.                                                              Getting Around Campus After Dark                               The University\u2019s transportation system runs 3 different bus routes from 7am to 12 midnight that covers the main campus and off campus facilities. From 12 midnight to 7am, a free, on call \u201csafe ride program\u201d is available for those students needing transportation from one University facility to another. To use the service students simply call 212-992-VANS and give their pickup and drop-off locations.                                                              New Student Safety                               NYU is a major international university, with students coming from throughout the U.S. and all over the world. Many students come from locations where the custom involves taking few precautions. It is a good idea for all students to make crime prevention a habit by taking responsibility for locking doors when away from their rooms, not leaving valuables unattended, using common sense, and being aware of their surroundings. Public Safety is available to answer any questions about campus crime prevention. The 24 hour command center telephone number is 212-998-2222. There's also more information on the Public Safety website .

Note: This course fulfills 4 units of the Interdisciplinary Seminar and the Humanities foundation requirements.          Course Description          It is often claimed of Paris that the color blindness of its citizens and politics created a haven for African American expatriates. It is certainly true that some of the most important political, philosophical, literary and artistic works of African American culture arise from an encounter with the City of Light, but contained within these works is not &quot;racelessness&quot; but a pronounced sense and articulation of what it means to be a Black American.   From the written works of Harlem Renaissance writers Langston Hughes, Claude McKay and Countee Cullen that fomented the Negritude movement, to the performances of Josephine Baker, to the art of Henry Ossawa Tanner and Beauford Delaney, to the music of jazz musicians Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Bill Coleman, to the political philosophies and writings of W.E.B Dubois and James Baldwin, Paris's influence on the creation of African American culture has been profound. Less noted is the degree to which the African American presence in Paris influenced international art and political thought, from the use of African cubism among European artists to the shaping of the philosophies of thinkers like Sarte, Camus and de Beauvoir.   We will focus on Paris as a site of exchange\u2014as an intersection through which pass influential ideas, forms and actions. We will consider the degree to which the encounter with Paris paradoxically made African American writers and artists more aware of and intent upon defining and articulating their Americanness, and finding in it a foundation for increased political activism and shaping of a Pan-African sensibility and community. This class will examine the literature, art, food, geographies and politics of African American expatriates in Paris, paying particular attention to the ways that the view from another shore shaped political thought and activism arising from a deepened awareness of national and international identity that Paris inspired.   Trips to explore the richness of African American life in Paris will include walking tours of &quot;Black Paris,&quot; visits to the Louvre and other museums that hold African American art, restaurants that were centers of African American culture in Paris, and even gravesites where expatriates are buried, and which raise crucial questions about the meanings of &quot;home.&quot; Students will have plenty of time to use the ideas and works in the course to create their projects and pursue their own ideas.   Students are required to live in program housing arranged by NYU Gallatin.

The NYU Paris academic center is located within proximity of Paris' most renowned cultural, artistic, and academic institutions. The resident director, administrative staff, and faculty advise students during their stay in Paris. During the summer session, all undergraduates are housed in student residences in lively and historic neighborhoods. Experience the City of Light with its cultural richness, history, and vibrant daily life through this intellectually and aesthetically stimulating study abroad program.          ACADEMICS   The undergraduate program in Paris provides a rich introduction to historic and present-day France through classroom studies and diverse extracurricular activities. Intensive French language classes, offered at all levels, are taught by instructors with native proficiency. Faculty who teach French civilization courses (offered in English or in French), provide exceptional academic instruction. Courses include field trips to culturally significant sites in the city.           HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students must stay in NYU provided housing. Participants in the summer undergraduate program are housed in a residence hall in a lively neighborhood close to the historic neighborhoods of the Marais and the Bastille, and within easy commuting distance to the NYU academic center.   All classes are held at the centrally located NYU Paris Center, comprised of classrooms, a student lounge, a lecture hall, and computer terminals for student use. Students are also strongly recommended to bring their own laptop computers. The NYU Paris staff helps students make the most of their summer in Paris. Full-time staff includes the Resident Director of NYU Paris, Academic and Student Life Staff, and an on-site Counselor.           EXCURSIONS      To enhance students' academic experience, NYU Paris hosts several lectures throughout the summer session that bring together French and Francophone artists, scholars, and activists. Cultural activities such as neighborhood walking tours, visits to world famous museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and attendance at numerous ballet, concert, and theatre performances are scheduled to complement the academic program. Excursions further complete the cultural calendar: activities planned for 2015 may include day trips to Chartres, Giverny, and the D-Day beaches in Normandy.

Below is information on best practices on how to be secure in and around campus.                                                  NYU Protects Them                                 With uniformed security officers who are on duty 24x7x365   Our emergency number 212-998-2222   Emergency Call boxes are located throughout the main campus   Green light buildings are staffed 24 hours a day by Public Safety Officers   Safe Havens \u2014 approximately 75 in number serve as places to go for an NYU community member in distress   Transportation Services \u2014 provides free transportation from residence halls to the main campus. Safe Ride Program exists from 12 midnight to 7:00am. Call 212-992-VANS for more information.                                                                Safety in the City                                 NYU students are statistically safer than the average city resident, who are safer than most other large city residents. However, this is a major city and is not without criminal activity.   Students need to be aware of their surroundings, walk with a positive bearing. If you use an electronic device to listen to music, keep the volume to a reasonable level.   Trust your instincts; if a situation makes you feel uncomfortable, get away as quickly as possible. Make casual eye contact with the person making you feel uncomfortable just to let them know you are aware of their presence.   Travel in groups of two or more (the buddy system)   Let a roommate or friend know where you are going and when you plan on returning.   Be aware of pickpocket situations \u2014 crowded areas e.g. subways, concerts, etc.   Use Gear Guards (available through Public Safety) to protect back packs, etc.   Men - carry wallets in front pants pocket.   Women - use bags, pocketbooks etc. that zipper well; keep pocketbooks on your lap when in restaurants etc. Avoid the backs of chairs or under the table, carry your bag close to your body, tucked in the bend of your elbow. Avoid bags that clasp or snap shut.   Beware of scam artists offering big returns for little or no money (often referred to as good faith money). If it seems too good to be true - IT IS.   The best time to use ATMs is during the daylight hours. Use bank affiliated ATMs whenever possible.   Avoid carrying large amounts of cash; avoid counting or displaying money on the street.   Minimize the number of credit cards carried.   Carry money for emergencies e.g. cab fare, quarters for phone calls   When traveling, plan your route ahead of time, know how to get to where you are going.   Subway stops with lit green globes are open 24 hours a day, red globes means entry is closed, red over white coloring is a metro-card only entrance. It is always a good idea to have a metro-card with a sufficient balance.   On subways \u2014 where possible stay in the token booth area until your train arrives   On the platform \u2014 look for a black and white striped board. That is where the car with the conductor will stop. You can also ride in the first car where the train operator is located.   When entering a subway car look around. Does anyone make you feel uneasy, if so, move.   Try sitting in the middle of the subway car away from the doorway.   Keep chains and jewelry hidden. Turn gemstones in toward your palms.   On the street \u2014 Travel well-lit and populated areas. Avoid &quot;short cuts.&quot; If you must travel alone late at night, call someone at your destination to let them know you are coming and how long it will take you to arrive.   If a car approaches you and asks for directions, speak with the occupants at a safe distance no matter what.   If you feel you are being followed cross the street, if that person follows you again, recross the street. If you're still being followed look for a open store etc., begin to run, call out &quot;HELP!!&quot;, or call out to someone on the street as if you know them.                                                                Safety if You're Going Out to a Bar or Club                                 Do not go out alone. Always go out in groups of 2 or more and travel on well-lit and populated streets.   Tell your friends/roommates if you\u2019re leaving, with whom, where you\u2019re planning to go and when you\u2019ll see them back at home.   Do not accept open drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) from others who you do not know or do not trust; this includes drinks that come in a glass.   Never leave your drink unattended or turn your back on your table.   Do not drink from open beverage sources like punch bowls, pitchers or tubs.   Keep your eyes and ears open; if friends appear to be &quot;too intoxicated&quot; for what they have consumed, leave the party or club immediately, and return home or seek medical attention. Do not return to the club or party!   Be alert and aware of your surroundings at all times.   Know where you need to go and the safest way to get there.   Trust your instincts: If you sense something is wrong, get away from the situation.                                                                Safety on Campus                                 When in the library and study hall, dining facilities, etc. keep wallets, cell phones and laptops with you. These are the type of property that are commonly reported stolen. Crimes of Opportunity can be minimized by safeguarding your property. Buy a laptop security cable and use it.   OPERATION ID - A joint program with the NYPD to register smart phones, tablets, laptops and other small electronic devices. If the device is lost or stolen, and turned into the NYPD, the owner can be contacted to reclaim their property. No cost to register your devices!     In your residence, always close and lock your door even if leave for just a minute. Insist your roommate(s) do the same.   Establish rules with your roommate(s) regarding visitors (above and beyond NYU Housing rules).   Be wary of people striking up a conversation with you in Washington Square Park or on the street. Be especially aware of people looking for a place to stay even if they seem very nice and harmless.

The University is committed to the safety and well-being of its students, faculty, and staff, and we strive to ensure the safety of the campus community by employing a large, well-trained, 24/7 corps of public safety officers; by making sure the grounds are well lit, well patrolled, and well traveled; by offering education and guidance so that members of the community can effectively contribute to their own safety; and by cultivating and maintaining a close, excellent relationship with the New York City Police department and New York City governmental authorities. New York University is located in one of the safest areas of the New York City, the safest large city in the U.S., and our campus has a reputation for attentiveness to security and \u2013 particularly given its geographical size, location, and population size \u2013 for a relatively low amount of crime, particularly serious crime . Still, crime does occur on and around our campus, as it does on all college campuses, and we are constantly striving to improve campus security and emphasizing the importance of incorporating safety into one\u2019s daily routine. Campus crime statistics are updated daily and are available 24 hours a day on the Public Safety web page (http://www.nyu.edu/public.safety/policies/crimestatistics.html) and at Public Safety\u2019s Central Command Center, which is located in the center of campus at 14 Washington Place.   Our annual campus security and fire safety report are published every fall and, are available online and at  various locations around campus.                                                                Who provides campus security                               The NYU Public Safety Department is the principal provider of security. Our department includes more than 300 uniformed NYS state certified Public Safety officers and 20 mid-senior level supervisors who serve the campus community 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The University Public Safety Department, often working in conjunction with other campus offices, offer crime prevention and security programs, including training in theft prevention, alcohol/drug awareness, sexual assault prevention, and personal defense. Transportation services, emergency phones, a safe haven program, green light buildings and an  escort service are also part of campus safety programming.                                                              Residence Hall Safety                               At least one uniformed Public Safety Officer is assigned to the entrance of every residence hall on a 24/7 basis to check every person entering the building and maintain a safe environment. The Department works closely with the Residential Education Department, its staff, and NYU\u2019s 300+ resident assistants (RA\u2019s) and 50 Peer Educators to offer special programs on safety as well as on assault, theft, and rape prevention; those programs begin as students arrive for Welcome Week. The residence halls are equipped with fire and life-safety systems , and fire evacuation drills are conducted five times per year. Students are issued keys at check-in, and every hall has established procedures and guidelines to help ensure the safety of its residents. All secondary hall entrances are locked 24 hours a day. Visitor and guest policies vary from hall to hall, but all hall guests must register.                                                              Public Safety Collaborations                               Public Safety works closely with all the members of the Wellness Exchange, particularly the student health center and residential education, to ensure the health and well being of all NYU students. Through the 24/7 Wellness Exchange hotline, students can speak to a counselor regarding a health/mental health matter and the Wellness Exchange frequently involves Public Safety where it is appropriate to handle situations.                                                              Getting Around Campus After Dark                               The University\u2019s transportation system runs 3 different bus routes from 7am to 12 midnight that covers the main campus and off campus facilities. From 12 midnight to 7am, a free, on call \u201csafe ride program\u201d is available for those students needing transportation from one University facility to another. To use the service students simply call 212-992-VANS and give their pickup and drop-off locations.                                                              New Student Safety                               NYU is a major international university, with students coming from throughout the U.S. and all over the world. Many students come from locations where the custom involves taking few precautions. It is a good idea for all students to make crime prevention a habit by taking responsibility for locking doors when away from their rooms, not leaving valuables unattended, using common sense, and being aware of their surroundings. Public Safety is available to answer any questions about campus crime prevention. The 24 hour command center telephone number is 212-998-2222.
