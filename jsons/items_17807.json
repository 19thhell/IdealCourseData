To accomplish this, the course examines the forces  that are spurring globalization - the integration of national business  activities into globally competitive markets. The course also examines  the forces that maintain differences between countries and regions.   As international trade plays a central role in fostering global integration,  we begin the semester by studying the economics of international trade  in goods and services. First, we examine the role of comparative advantage  as a determinant of the location of production. Then, we examine the reasons  for, and the effects of, government policies that create impediments to  international trade.   The second part of the course surveys the role of money and finance  in global economic activity. We study the role of exchange rates as key  prices in global finance. We show how the foreign exchange market can be  used by hedgers and by speculators, and we develop some major principles  of international financial investment. We also consider the role of government  policies toward the foreign exchange market, including the choice between  fixed and floating exchange rates, and the use of exchange controls to  create impediments to currency exchanges.   The final part of the course focuses on foreign direct investment and  the reasons for the increasing importance of multinational corporations.  It also explores several important challenges to global business operations.  In particular, we recognize two important environmental influences that  can affect the financial opportunities and performances of global corporations  - differences across cultures and differences in national legal and political  systems.   The course provides a survey of these big-picture global issues. It  also serves as the base for the International Studies Project course. In  addition, C45.0011 is a prerequisite for several IB elective courses, including  International Business Management, International Financial Management,  and International Marketing Management.   The prerequisites for the course are A31.0001 Principles of Macroeconomics  and A31.0002 Principles of Microeconomics, or the equivalent.            Course Materials    Required textbooks:   John J. Wild, Kenneth L. Wild, and Jerry C. Y. Han, International  Business: An Integrated Approach , NYU Edition, Prentice Hall, 2000.

Friedman, The Lexus and the Olive Tree , Anchor Books,  2000. (This book is to be read through out the semester.)   Several problem sets will be distributed. The problem sets need not be  handed in; rather, suggested answers will be distributed. Informal student  study groups to discuss the problem sets and other questions should be  fruitful.   It is highly recommended to keep up with current developments in the  international business environment, both for class purposes and for your  own benefit. You can do this by reading the relevant articles in a good  newspaper (e.g., Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Times )  or weekly magazine (e.g., The Economist ). You are encouraged  to bring up current events for discussion in class, as time permits.      Course Requirements and Evaluation    The course grade will be based on the following items, with approximate  weights indicated:            First mid-term examination      23%            Second mid-term examination      23%            Final examination      23%            Series of three Country Analyses (8% each)      24%            Contributions to class discussion (quality more than quantity)      7%            The coverage and dates for the written assignments:   First mid-term examination: Covers Part One, October 15, 2001.

Available on-site, online, or through a combination of both options, the 18-credit curriculum can be completed in as little as two semesters and provides the broad-based, interdisciplinary knowledge and skill sets essential for success in higher level executive roles within U.S.-based companies and organizations as well as international firms.   The five core courses that focus on business strategy and ethics; finance; human resource management; information technology; and marketing, represent the core competencies in which every businessperson must be proficient, to succeed in today's highly competitive global business environment.   The program is ideally suited for individuals who seek to upgrade and/or to update their general business knowledge and skills, and to earn a graduate-level credential. Rigorous course curriculum is taught by faculty members who are leaders in their fields and who are exceptional educators. Their real-world experience and their invaluable business connections add a unique dimension to the teaching and learning environment.   An important feature of the certificate is the required three-credit elective, which provides the opportunity for individuals to customize their course of study to satisfy their own professional goals and objectives. In consultation with an academic advisor, students select this elective from any of the graduate program areas offered through the NYU School of Professional Studies so as to place the acquired core business competencies within an industry-specific context. This aspect of the curriculum makes the certificate immediately relevant to an individual's current career path, or it can provide the foundation for career change.   The program can be completed fully online, or in a traditional classroom setting, or by blending a combination of the two formats.

To accomplish this, the course examines the forces  that are spurring globalization - the integration of national business  activities into globally competitive markets. The course also examines  the forces that maintain differences between countries and regions.   As international trade plays a central role in fostering global integration,  we begin the semester by studying the economics of international trade  in goods and services. First, we examine the role of comparative advantage  as a determinant of the location of production. Then, we examine the reasons  for, and the effects of, government policies that create impediments to  international trade.   The second part of the course surveys the role of money and finance  in global economic activity. We study the role of exchange rates as key  prices in global finance. We show how the foreign exchange market can be  used by hedgers and by speculators, and we develop some major principles  of international financial investment. We also consider the role of government  policies toward the foreign exchange market, including the choice between  fixed and floating exchange rates, and the use of exchange controls to  create impediments to currency exchanges.   The final part of the course focuses on foreign direct investment and  the reasons for the increasing importance of multinational corporations.  It also explores several important challenges to global business operations.  In particular, we recognize two important environmental influences that  can affect the financial opportunities and performances of global corporations  - differences across cultures and differences in national legal and political  systems.   The course provides a survey of these big-picture global issues. It  also serves as the base for the International Studies Project course. In  addition, C45.0011 is a prerequisite for several IB elective courses, including  International Business Management, International Financial Management,  and International Marketing Management.   The prerequisites for the course are A31.0001 Principles of Macroeconomics  and A31.0002 Principles of Microeconomics, or the equivalent.            Course Materials    Required textbooks:   John J. Wild, Kenneth L. Wild, and Jerry C. Y. Han, International  Business: An Integrated Approach , NYU Edition, Prentice Hall, 2000.

Friedman, The Lexus and the Olive Tree , Anchor Books,  2000. (This book is to be read through out the semester.)   Several problem sets will be distributed. The problem sets need not be  handed in; rather, suggested answers will be distributed. Informal student  study groups to discuss the problem sets and other questions should be  fruitful.   It is highly recommended to keep up with current developments in the  international business environment, both for class purposes and for your  own benefit. You can do this by reading the relevant articles in a good  newspaper (e.g., Financial Times, Wall Street Journal, New York Times )  or weekly magazine (e.g., The Economist ). You are encouraged  to bring up current events for discussion in class, as time permits.
