MS and Advanced Certificate Programs   The master's and advanced certificate programs are designed for nurses seeking advanced roles in clinical practice (nurse practitioners and nurse midwives), nursing administration, education, and informatics, while providing the necessary foundation for doctoral study. Graduates are prepared for leadership positions in teaching, clinical consultation, nursing management, administration, and advanced nursing practice in care of the adult, care of the elderly, care of infants, children, adolescents, mental health, holistic nursing, palliative care nursing (specialty sequence) and nurse midwifery. Whatever program is selected, the curriculum includes a core in nursing theory, research, statistics, population-focused care, and issues and trends in health care delivery.   DNP Program   The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) degree is the advanced nursing practice credential of the future! As the highest level of academic preparation for advanced clinical practice, the DNP prepares scholars for advanced clinical practice in a population focus area. In addition, DNP students learn to translate evidence-based knowledge into clinical practice and have a significant impact on health outcomes by strengthening system-level health care processes.   There are currently three entry points for the DNP Program:       NEW Post-Baccalaureate (BS) to DNP option for those who are registered nurses with a baccalaureate degree in nursing   Advanced Standing option for those who have earned a master\u2019s degree and are nurse practitioners (NPs) or certified nurse midwives (CNMs)   Post-Master\u2019s Bridge option for those nurses who have a master\u2019s degree but are not NPs or CNMs         PhD Program   The college\u2019s PhD program in Nursing Research and Theory Development is designed to prepare nurse researchers. The curriculum provides an excellent foundation in the philosophy of scientific inquiry, theory development in nursing science, quantitative and qualitative research designs, and methodological approaches to data management and analyses. Graduates of the PhD program assume major positions in academic, health care, research, and practice settings. Students may apply after having completed a master\u2019s degree or earlier during their educational trajectory in an effort to expedite the transition from baccalaureate or master\u2019s degree preparation to the research doctorate. The BS-to-PhD and MS-to-PhD pathways allow students to apply at the time of application to the BS/MS Dual Degree program or to the MS program.
