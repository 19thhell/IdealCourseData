D. Mills Award from the American College of Emergency Physicians. The award is presented to an active, life, or honorary member for significant contributions to emergency medicine. He is the first recipient from NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Edlich is also the author of the article \"Reflections on the Past 25 Years in Emergency Medicine\" which appeared this year in The Journal of Emergency Medicine .\u00a0\u00a0   John A. Kastor '62, Professor of Medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, is the author of the just published book, Selling Teaching Hospitals and Practice Plans: George Washington and Georgetown Universities . Dr. Kastor presents an insider's view of why university medical centers decide to sell teaching hospitals, why the decision might be a good one, and how such transitions are received by the faculty and administration. He tells the story of two universities that, under financial duress for more than a decade, chose to sell their teaching hospitals.\u00a0   David S. Rosenthal '63, '59 \u00a0Attending Physician in the Division of Endocrinology at Nassau University Medical Center (NUMC), has been included in Castle Connolly's Guide Top Doctors: New York Metro Area, 11th edition . While congratulating Dr. Rosenthal on being included in such a prestigious list, Arthur A. Gianelli, President/CEO of the Nassau Health Care Corporation stated: \u00a0\"This outstanding honor is a testament to Dr. Rosenthal's expertise in the field of endocrinology, demonstrating NUMC's commitment to its patients in providing the highest quality of care.\"   Alfred E. Stillman '63 tells us \"Last year, I published a book ( Home Visits: A Return to the Classical Role of the Physician , Radcliffe Publishing, 2007). \u00a0It had taken me four years to write. \u00a0I had spent the majority of my professional life in GI. \u00a0In 1994, I took a fellowship and started a new career in geriatrics. \u00a0I eventually gravitated toward the home visit aspect of geriatrics, a neglected and poorly remunerated field, but one which inspired me from first contact. \u00a0My book talks about the human quality of visiting the elderly who can no longer leave their homes but who were once an integral part of our society. \u00a0These patients' caregivers are also an important but often forgotten support system and each has a unique story worth recording. \u00a0The book is organized into a series of vignettes about several of my patients, each of whose plights drives home a point about elder care in America. \u00a0The work is really a social commentary and not a medical treatise and can (and should) be read by anyone who has a social conscience.\"   Bruce K. Young '63 shares, \"I've a book coming out May 6, 2008 called Miscarriage, Medicine &amp; Miracles: Everything You Need to Know About Miscarriage, published by Bantam/Dell Random House. It's for a general audience about miscarriage.\"   Richard A. Cash '66 has been chosen to receive the New York University Alumni Association's Distinguished Alumnus Award. The award will be given in recognition of his outstanding contributions to global public health in the developing world for over 40 years in more than 30 countries. His discovery and application of Oral Rehydration Therapy to treat cholera and other diseases is credited with saving millions of lives each year. Dr. Cash will receive the award at a luncheon on October 17, 2008 at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan. \u00a0   Let us know what you're up to!
