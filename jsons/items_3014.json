A gateway to all majors offered by the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. It focuses on the core concepts that intersect the constituent programs of SCA: Africana Studies, American Studies, Asian/Pacific/American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latino Studies, and Metropolitan Studies. The course surveys basic approaches to a range of significant analytical concepts (for example, property, work, technology, nature, popular culture, consumption, knowledge), each one considered within a two-week unit.    Approaches to Latino Studies   SCA-UA 501 Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (MAP-UA 529) can substitute for this course. 4 points.   Explores a set of principles that have guided Latino/a presence in the United States. These principles can be found in many but not necessarily all of the readings. They include urban/rural life, freedom/ confinement, memoir as source of voice/other sources of voice, generational separation and identity, and loss and healing. The course traces a movement through time from masculinist nationalism to the recognition of variations in gender, sexuality, race, class, region, and national origin. Other principles may be added to this list as the course proceeds.      Research Core    Senior Research Seminar   SCA-UA 90 Prerequisites: Concepts in Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA-UA 1) and either Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501) or Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (MAP-UA 529). Offered every semester. 4 points.   An advanced research course in Latino studies, which culminates in each student completing an extended research paper that makes use of various methodological skills. Students work individually and collaboratively on part of a class research project pertaining to the major in Latino studies. Majors take this course in the fall of their senior year.      Honors Track    Senior Honors Seminar   SCA-UA 92 Prerequisites: 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) and permission of the department. Offered in the fall. 4 points.

Internship Seminar    SCA-UA 42 Corequisite: Internship Fieldwork (SCA-UA 40). 2 points.   The 4-point internship program complements and enhances the formal course work of the Latino studies major. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to Latino studies and take a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytical tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring professional career paths. The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the director of internships.      Elective Courses Latino/a Art and Performance in New York City    SCA-UA 532 4 points.   Looks at the history of Latino/a art and performance in the context of New York City. In particular, students study Latino/a aesthetic practices within and against the social-political environment of their enactment. Latinos' role in the continually redefined realm of music, the extensive history of Latina/o contributions to the artistic vitality of the Lower East Side, and the wider performance context of Latina cultural production represent a few of the areas that are explored. Students consider contemporary Latino art, and the institutions that support it, from the perspective of the changing Latino demographic of New York City. Furthermore, students examine and analyze the specific ways that artists utilize the city as a site for artistic possibility. This course brings together both an investigation of the aesthetics of Latino performance and an investigation of democratic possibilities of urban space. In addition to the weekly seminar meeting, students are required to attend several performances, visit art galleries, and execute a research project profiling a particular artist or institution.    Latino/a Popular Culture   SCA-UA 534 4 points.   Latinos are at the heart of numerous genres of popular culture production: music, film, graphic novels, performance. This course examines contemporary popular culture products by and for Latinos, looking in particular at issues of production, circulation, and consumption. Is popular culture a site of Latino/a cultural expression, how and in what ways? How is it circulated and consumed, how is it mediated by different culture industries? What do we even mean by Latino/a popular culture? These and more questions are considered through a range of interdisciplinary studies.    Latino/a Sexualities   SCA-UA 536 4 points.   Examines the study of sexuality as it pertains to the production and representation of Latino/a identities. Students consider the integral roles scholarship and literature on/about Latino/a sexuality have played in the history of the broader U.S. feminist movement, feminist theory, and GLBTQ studies. The course begins with the examination of classic Chicana feminist texts and the anthropological study of Latino sexual practices in light of their influential interventions in U.S. studies on gender and sexuality since the 1980s and early 1990s. Students then explore more recent contributions by Latino scholars that disrupt the simplistic ways in which Latino/a sexuality has been taken up as an exotic and radical departure from foundational work on sexuality. Students engage sexuality in its plurality, examining multiple imaginings of Latino/a sexuality through fiction, performance theory, queer Latino/a critiques, and studies on emerging Latino masculinities.    The Latinized City, New York and Beyond   SCA-UA 540 Prerequisite: Approaches to Latino Studies (SCA-UA 501), an introductory course in the social sciences, or a MAP Cultures and Contexts course. Davila. Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines the Latinization of urban landscapes in New York City and beyond. Considers the economic and political factors that have historically fueled the immigration of Latin American peoples to U.S. cities, their incorporation into U.S. society and culture, and the impact of global economic restructuring of U.S. cities on urban race/ethnic relations and cultural politics. Other topics include the contestation of space and power in the global cities, issues of immigration and citizenship, and the politics of languages. Students also develop fieldwork projects geared to discovering the history and present-day landscapes of Latino New York.    Topics in Latino Studies   SCA-UA 541 4 points.   Possible issues, which vary from semester to semester, include race and racism, politics, migration and immigration, language, assimilation, education, labor, citizenship, social movements, and expressive culture. Latino Politics in the U.S. SCA-UA 542 Offered every fall. 4 points. Examines the history, status, and political behavior of Latinos as a minority group in the U.S. political system. Begins with a historical analysis of Latino political incorporation, followed by an analysis of the various activities and efforts in which Latinos have engaged to gain political power and influence. Also examines identity-based social movements of the 1960s and \u201970s, depictions of Latinos as a pan-ethnic voting bloc during the 1980s and into today, the politics of transnationalism and globalization, and the recent political activism surrounding immigration. Looks at sub-group populations hailing from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Central and South America, utilizes case studies, historical and theoretical monographs, primary documents, and recent poll data surveying Latino political behavior and opinions. Class Warfare SCA-UA 545 Offered every other year. 4 points. \u201cClass warfare\u201d became the political buzzword of the 2012 presidential election and in response to the 2008 financial crisis, and has continued to signal the primacy of inequality as the abiding public issue of our times. For social theorists, the \u201cclass warfare\u201d card is an open invitation to re-visit Marxist and other uses of the concept of class and its relevance to contemporary society. We will study how class conflict plays out in international and institutional settings or \u201ccomplexes\u201d of present-day society, such as neo-liberal politics, incarceration, educational apartheid, and mass deportation of immigrants, Discussion will be based on readings from classical and recent social analysis by a range of authors from Rousseau, Marx and Gramsci to Barbara Ehrenreich, Michelle Alexander and Naomi Klein, as well as important documentary films by Michael Moore, Charles Ferguson and Stephanie Black. We will end the course by examining a range of strategies for change and engagement in contemporary class warfare, with a focus on the Occupy Movement and its consequences. Latina Feminisms SCA-UA 548 4 points. Designed as seminar on contemporary cultural production by Latina feminist artists. Theory/cultural criticism paired with corresponding object of study, i.e. film, fiction, poetry, visual and performance art. First half of course models rigorous scholarship for student, offering different theoretical perspectives for interpreting cultural objects as social and political texts. Advanced seminar, experience with theoretical reading recommended. Second half of the course focuses on cultural production (film, fiction, poetry, visual and performance art). We will critically analyze recurrent tropes and themes\u2014the borderlands as geographical and psychic boundary; the \"mestiza\" or \"mulata\" body as metaphor; assimilation experiences and familial relations; racism and education; revolution and political violence as theme; the literature of exile; the figure of the Malinche/la llorona as race traitor or victim; the domestic/maquiladora worker as virgin or whore\u2014that occur throughout aesthetics of contemporary Latina artists in order to better understand the racial politics within post-nationalist movements for social justice.    Cultural Spaces of Latinidad   SCA-UA 557 4 points.   Examines the contemporary production and meanings of Latino/Hispanic identities in the United States. Looks at the spaces and institutions where this identity is produced and contested and explores how its definition has changed since it was first felt and then officially recognized by the U.S. census. Also examines representations of Latino/a identity in relation to the very real Latino/a populations that now make up the largest \"minority\" in the United States. For most of the course, explores differences and similarities in the politics of Latinidad in four important, yet not exclusive, \"spaces\" involved in the production and representation of Latinidad: the culture industries, urban politics, transnational processes, and contemporary polemics that reach the \"mainstream.\" In other words, this course is designed to theorize Latinidad, in particular \"fields of cultural production,\" whether geographic, institutional, or imaginary. Discusses students' individual research projects for the remainder of the course. Asks students to select a particular \"space\" involved in the production of Latinidad for further study. NAFTA and Narcos SCA-UA 562 Colloquium. Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines political and economic consequences of NAFTA on Mexican and U.S. foreign direct investment, industrialization, labor formation, and immigration. Traces flow of drugs, arms and profits of the drug economy, as well as relationship between rise in violence, militarization of the Americas, and changes in drug war policy in Mexico and the U.S. Considers gender dynamics of both free trade and the drug economy and critically examines the figure of the narco or drug trafficker in popular culture.    Afro-Latino Culture and History   SCA-UA 565 Offered every fall. 4 points.   Examines the profound sociological and cultural implications of the growing Afro-Latino presence in light of recent theorizing on race and diasporas. After an overview of the historical background of African-descended peoples in the Spanish-speaking Americas, we then trace the longstanding social experience of black Latinos in the United States. Along with a discussion of migration patterns and community formations, we focus on narrative accounts of Afro-Latino life and on the traditions of cultural expression. Special attention is paid to Afro-Latino poetry and to the rich history of Afro-Latino music through the generations, from rumba, mambo, and Cubop to salsa, Latin soul, and hip-hop. Finally, we turn to the possible theoretical and political consequences of this increasingly self-conscious transnational identity formation.    Caribbean Women Writers   SCA-UA 570 4 points.   Focuses on texts by Latinas of Caribbean origin whose work explores the intersections between history, gender, nation, and sexuality. Analyzing how contemporary Caribbean-origin literature by Latinas can be read as a manifestation of the complex histories of colonialism, military intervention, and political maneuverings between the United States and the Caribbean in the 20th century, the course considers the ways in which the \"tropicalized\" Latina body came to represent an insidious and seductive threat to the U.S. domestic landscape. The course addresses questions such as, What are the politics behind demeaning, fetishizing, and vilifying Latinas in the U.S. media? What role do women of Caribbean origin play in propagating, preserving, or undermining U.S. domestic life? Readings include prose, poetry, film, and music by authors and artists of Cuban, Dominican, Haitian, and Puerto Rican origin, emphasizing the diverse ways in which Caribbean-origin Latinas affect and are affected by the United States. This course is based on students' active participation in class discussion, weekly response papers, presentations, and a research paper.    Postmodern Travel Fictions   SCA-UA 572 Offered in the spring. 4 points.   This is a study of travel narratives by post\u2013World War II authors/filmmakers of the Americas. Designed to investigate relationships existing between travel narratives and legacy of colonialism in the Americas; between the concept of \"freedom\" embodied in travel writing and the ideology of conquest engraved in historical memory; and between lost idealism of youth and melancholic romps across continents; and between literary representation and the perpetuation of racialized myths about North and South America. Emphasis on gendered dynamic of travel writing. How are notions of freedom and mobility tied to sexuality? Why do the protagonists of novels and films\u2014white, black, Latino, Asian American, or indigenous\u2014\"go West,\" South, East, or North? Why do they ping-pong among these geographic and symbolic poles? What are the evaluative meanings assigned to the cartographically given spaces these protagonists choose to visit and these authors/directors choose to revise in their novels and films?
