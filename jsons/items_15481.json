Teaching Assistant: Nelly Fazio (fazio@cs.nyu.edu)    Objectives  We will examine the intellectual foundations of our profession: how can we formalize the notion of computation, what mathematical descriptions can we give of different models of computation, what are the limits of computation (are there precisely formulated problems which no computation can answer?) and finally, how fast can we compute the answer to various classes of problems.  We will examine the intimate relation between classes of computational problems and languages, and touch on issues of programming and compiling. This study has a mathematical flavor, and we will present arguments in a  reasonably rigorous manner, with theorems and their proofs. We will try to keep in sight the actual practice of writing programs, even though the course will not have a required programming component.

There is a class mailing list, csci_ua_0453_001_fa12. I send homework updates and other useful information to this list. You should be automatically subscribed to the list (I will send a test message in the first week of classes); if you are not subscribed please join the list: see http://www.cs.nyu.edu/mailman/listinfo/csci_ua_0453_001_fa12     Course Goal and Syllabus . The goal of this class is to develop your ability to evaluate and write mathematical claims in computer science, so as to be able to:      Judge when a problem is solved (and equally important, when it is not yet solved).    Explain such mathematical claims clearly and precisely.    Broadly speaking, this course will be studying what can and cannot be computed, and when something can be computed how simply can it be done. The specific topics covered will include proofs techniques, finite automata and regular languages, pushdown automata and context free languages, decidable and undecidable problems, and NP-completeness.  Assignments . There will be more or less weekly homeworks. Late homeworks will not be accepted (except in the event of illness or other unavoidable circumstances). If for some reason you will be unable to hand in a homework on time, please discuss it with me beforehand. While you may discuss homework problems with your fellow students, you must write up your solutions in your own words. Be aware that you are unlikely to perform well on exams unless you gain practice at problem solving on the homeworks.   Academic Integrity . Please take note of the course and departmental policy on this matter: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/academic_integrity.html     Assessment . The homeworks will comprise 40% of the overall grade, the midterm 20% and the final 40%. However, if the grade on the final is better than the midterm grade it will replace the midterm grade. Exams will be closed book.   Required text . There is no required text. I will be providing handouts that cover the course material. There is no textbook that is particularly close to my approach to the material. If you want a textbook, you might consider: Michael Sipser, Introduction to the Theory of Computation , Thomson. The second edition has the advantage of including solutions to a selection of problems. However, let me point out that the approach I will be taking diverges quite a bit from this text. Another possible text is: Daniel I.A. Cohen, Introduction to Computer Theory. This text provides a lot of examples and can be quite helpful. However, it does not cover material for the whole course, and the approach it takes differs even more from the one I will be using in this course.    Reading guide . Basically, you should read the handouts I will be preparing. These amount to the \"textbook\" for the course.   Here is a detailed lecture by lecture reading guide.     Homework Details . You may handwrite your homework, legibly of course, if you prefer, rather than typeset it. In my experience, when typesetting, often too much effort is spent on the appearance of the homework and minor yet significant errors are overlooked.  Also, if your homework solution has multiple pages, please staple them; please don't fold down the corners or use paperclips, for the pages are much more likely to come apart. Finally, if handwriting, please use an easy to read ink color (blue or black, not red or green).

Be aware that you are unlikely    to perform well on exams unless you gain practice at problem    solving on the homeworks.         Self-grading . On the day the homeworks are due I will be    handing out solution sets. You are required to grade a copy of    your homework using the solution set as a guide and to hand the    graded copy in at the following class session. The self-grading    should indicate the mistakes in the original solution and why they    are mistakes. We will grade your original solution and your    self-grading. The purpose of this is to enhance your    understanding of the material.         To facilitate the management of the homework, I ask that you do    the following.     1. Write the solutions leaving space for your grading comments and    for our grading comments (e.g. margins on both sides, and top and    bottom, and don't use tightly spaced lines).     2. Hand in you solution on Monday at the start of class. Hand in    your self-graded solution on Wednesday, again, at the start of    class.     3. You may handwrite your homework, legibly of course, or typeset    it. The best way to typeset mathematical material is to use Latex.         Further Comments . If you are unable to completely solve a   problem (or you cannot solve it at all) please write down your   thoughts on how the problem should be approached, and where you   approach breaks down. Or if you have given an answer that you know   is incorrect, please indicate what the error is.    Academic Integrity . Please take note of the    course and departmental policy on this matter: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/academic_integrity.html         Assessment . Homeworks will comprise 40% of the overall    grade, the midterm 20% and the final 40%. However, if the    grade on the final is better than the midterm grade it will    replace the midterm grade. Exams will be closed book.     Required text . The required text is the book I have been    writing and teaching this course from for several years. Links to    the chapters are below. The text is available for purchase from    NYU Reprographics/Copy Central (547 La Guardia Place).     If you want a published textbook, you might consider: Michael    Sipser, Introduction to the Theory of Computation ,     Thomson. The most recent edition has the advantage of    including solutions to a selection of problems. However, let me    point out that the approach I will be taking diverges quite a bit    from this text.
