ARTH-UA 411 Neoclassicism to Realism          MW 2:00-3:15         Professor Mansfield  Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.        The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical   ways. On the one hand, the period\u2019s valorization of cool rationalism   contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the   18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by   the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form   of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its   emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product   of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of   romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of   romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic   movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century   artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but   its political consequences as well.      ARTH-UA 413 Cubism to Abstract Expressionism          TR 3:30-4:45         Professor Robinson  Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the   artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the   development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure   abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following   impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to   symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the arts and crafts movement,   fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are   analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that   generated them. ARTH-UA 450 section 1 Social History of Photography  TR 11:00-12:15         Professor Shelley Rice Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, or a   score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every fall. 4 points.   This course is a social and political history of photography, from its   beginnings to the present day. It focuses on the popular forms of   photographic imagery, such as advertising, fashion, travel photography,   family portraits and snapshots, scientific documents, documentary reform   and photojournalism, as well as describes the medium\u2019s relationship to   Western (and global) social history during the modern era. Brady,   Warhol, Capa, Nadar, Martin Chambi, Atget, Tomatsu, Muybridge, Curtis,   Bourke-White, Gordon Parks, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, and Berenice Abbott are in   the cast of characters to be discussed, and readings include those by   Susan Sontag, John Berger, and Roland Barthes, among others. ARTH-UA 450 section 2 Abstract Art 1910-2010 MW 11:00-12:15           Professor Karmel Prerequisite ARTH-UA 2 or ARTH-UA 6   with a   minimum grade of C. 4  points.    Abstraction is usually identified with the modernist idea that each art should be faithful to its own specific medium. Painters should therefore stick to arranging lines and colors on flat surfaces, and not be seduced into creating imaginary figures or illusionistic spaces. From this point of view, the history of abstraction begins around 1910 and ends around 1970 with the triumph of minimalism (a.k.a. \u201cthe end of art\u201d), because you can\u2019t get any flatter or more literal than that.  This \u201cmodernist\u201d account of abstraction no longer looks very convincing. For one thing, there have been four decades of abstraction since the supposed end of art in 1970. For another, it\u2019s become obvious that the wide variety of abstract paintings and sculptures made between 1910 and 2010 cannot be understood under simple rubrics such as \u201cpurity,\u201d \u201creductiveness,\u201d or \u201ctruth to medium.\u201d It has also become apparent that modernist abstraction is linked to 19th-century theories of perception, decoration, and symbolism.   This course will offer a new approach to the history of abstraction. Dividing the history of abstract art into three periods (1910-1945, 1945-1970, and 1970-2010), we will look not just at the official movements that emerge in each period, but also at the formal and thematic concerns that connect and divide artists in supposedly different movements.  Sorting abstract compositions into \u201cwebs,\u201d \u201cgrids,\u201d and \u201cblobs,\u201d we will follow formal inventions as they jump from one style to another. Examining the styles and themes shared by abstract and figurative artists, we will look at the apocalyptic subtext of early, expressionist abstraction; the utopian associations of the geometric grid; the surrealist imagery of biomorphic abstraction; the anthropological thinking behind the new American abstraction of the mid-century; the feminist ideology of \u201cdecorative\u201d abstraction after 1970; and the diverse allusions of contemporary abstraction, including maps, networks, bodily fluids, and graffiti.    V43.0511 East Asian Art II: China, Japan, Korea from 1000 CE to Present            TR 12:30-1:45 Professor Hsu Identical to EAST-UA 92. Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from   approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding   of the development of art and culture as well as mastery of specific   works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common   cultural heritage of the North East Asia region. Part of this   commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing   Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also   developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in   the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape   paintings, Edo \u201cfloating world\u201d prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.

ARTH-UA 671 Architecture in Context     R 4:55-7:35       Professor White Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 601, ARTH-UA 661, and permission of the program director. 4 points.   Addresses issues arising from new structures and interventions to   existing structures, which must relate to existing well-defined contexts   of the sort found throughout New York City. Students are encouraged to   think about, discuss, create, and report on designs that recognize and   suit their contexts. The focus is on typical New York City building   types. Includes town houses, additions to existing structures, adaptive   reuse of residential structures for institutional use, streetscape   improvements, and urban parks. ARTH-UA 673 Urban Design: Infrastructure   M 6:20-8:50 Professor Haff Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 601, ARTH-UA 661, and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 4 points.    Serves as a laboratory for the investigation of New York City\u2019s   infrastructure, using the definition of the word as a point of   departure. In what ways can the city be perceived as a collective   undertaking, with intricate components interwoven in continuous strands?   What systems and forces give the city and its neighborhoods their   current form, and what influences their future shape? Can these systems   be dissected? What do these analyses tell us about the relationship of   the city to its inhabitants and to the wider environment? Through   lectures, reading assignments, discussions, and field trips, we   investigate some of the major components of the city\u2019s infrastructure,   such as the street grid, water supply, waste disposal, and subway   system.

The course assists students in creating a   comprehensive series of drawings and in building a portfolio. Advanced Seminar    Permission of the director of undergraduate studies required.  Open to departmental majors who are juniors and seniors, have completed the relevant survey course, and have completed one advanced course in a relevant subject area. Given every fall and spring. 4 points.    Exposure in small group discussion format to historical/critical  problem(s) of particular present concern to the faculty member offering  the seminar. Requires oral report(s) and/or a substantial paper.    ARTH-UA 800 section 1 Toward a Critical Vocabulary   T 2:00-5:00   Professor Shelley Rice This course takes as its main emphasis the analysis and synthesis of visual and written information. The readings include essays by critics Roland Barthes, Donna Haraway, Susan Sontag, Boris Groys and bell hooks (among others), as well as articles or excerpts by Thomas Kuhn, Mircea Eliade, John Berger and George Kubler. Critical essays are interspersed with other kinds of texts, like The Tibetan Book of the Dead , Persepolis , Black Elk Speaks and the novel Perfume. This mixture of topics, texts and issues is designed to broaden students\u2019 understanding of important concerns in philosophy, art history, science, literature, and cultural studies that are relevant to photography. Class time is spent in analysis of these texts in relation to historical and contemporary pictures.    ARTH-UA 800 section 2 Everyone's a Critic: Reading Art Criticism and How to Write Some Yourself W 9:30-12:15   Professor Plagens We'll both read and write art criticism. The reading--a course-pack of essays and reviews, with no textbook--will take us from some anti-modern reactionaries at the beginning of the 20th century, through mid-last-century's big names (Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, Robert Hughes), to some late modern and postmodern heavyweights (Rose, Foster), to contemporary reviewers such as Roberta Smith, to some necessary \"theory,\" politicized criticism, and up-to-the-minute reviews and blogs. The student writing will consist of three reviews, from 500 to 1500 words, and a final paper (essay). We'll \"workshop\" selected (by volunteering or chance) reviews in class, i.e., everyone will get a copy, the author will read it aloud, and we'll all pitch in to \"edit\" is, as if for publication. The class will have some visuals, one film, and occasional short quizzes on the reading. Some questions running through the course are: Are there any objective stands in art criticism, or is it all simply subjective opinion? What are the different kinds of art criticism, and who's the audience for them? What's the effect of the precipitous decline of print and the precipitous rise of the digital world on art criticism? Can honest and/or effective art criticism be practiced in today's hyper-market art world? How esoteric must writing about contemporary art be? Of what art-world career use is this course?  ARTH-UA 800 section 3 Holier than Thou: The Cult of Saints in Renaissance and Baroque Art      T 9:30-12:15   Professor L. Rice Promoted by the Church as paragons of virtue, saints exemplify the values, aspirations, and anxieties of the societies that venerated them. This seminar focuses on the cult of saints and its expression in the visual arts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when Protestant resistance to the very notion of saints triggered a resurgence and reshaping of Catholic devotional practices. We will examine the origins of the cult of saints and its evolution over time; the veneration of saints' relics and the often contentious politics surrounding their authenticity and ownership; the revival of interest in the early Church and the rise of hagiography (the study of saints' lives) as a critical discipline; the persistence of Medieval subject matter and the introduction of new iconographic tropes; saint-making in the early modern era and its impact on the history of Renaissance and Baroque art and architecture.  ARTH-UA 800 section 5 Media as Medium: Strategies in Contemporary Art from the Nineties to Now    M 2:00-4:45   Professor Robinson Contemporary art since the 1990s has generated meaning in relation to changing global frameworks and technologies. Rather than shaping forms, it places objects in circulation. We no longer read art in terms of one medium \u2013 painting, sculpture, photography, film \u2013 but the prospect of many media at once, mobilized as an intervention into ever-changing fields of communication. It is the argument of this seminar that current artistic practice might best be read as a set of \u201cstrategies.\u201d In the ever-expanding media landscape of the present, art works operate with the same codes as those of the world beyond them, create meaning in the same ways, and enter our consciousness through global channels that are in wide use. This seminar will consider contemporary art since the 1990s as a set of strategies and interventions. It will look at the social/political/mediatic frameworks surrounding a range of recent projects. We examine systematically how artistic practice today is dependent on such larger structures, situations, and contexts. The artists we focus on - treated monographically, week by week, are grouped in terms of their strategies, and the discursive concepts that have emerged as a result. Strategies we will consider are: the photographic, the performative, the utopia of the participatory, post studio/ post medium, interjection in global networks, and collective or group-based actions/events. Artists covered include: Douglas Gordon, Doug Aitken, Steve McQueen, Damien Hirst, Gabriel Orozco, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Liam Gillick, Pierre Huyghe, Zoe Leonard, Emily Jacir, Maria Eichhorn. ARTH-UA 800 section 6 Exhibitions: Curating and Displaying Global Art      W 3:30-6:10   Professor Basilio In this seminar we will analyze contemporary developments in global exhibitions, primarily biennials. To do this, we will first briefly look at the history of World's Fairs, and the beginning of the Venice Biennial, Sao Paulo Biennial, and Documenta. We will then focus on case studies of specific highly influential editions of such exhibitions and the creation of biennials in other locations, such as Havana or Shanghai.  ARTH-UA 801 Senior Honors Thesis    R 2:00-4:45   Professor Serdari    Open to departmental majors who have been accepted as candidates  for honors in art history in the first term of their senior year and  who have the permission of the director of undergraduate studies.

Permission of Insturctor required. 4  points . Prerequisite: Introduction to Classical Archaeology (V27.0305), or Archaeologies of Greece (V27.0352), or Introduction to Ancient Art (V43.0003 or ARTH-UA 3, identical to V27.0310), or History of Western Art I (V43.0001 or ARTH-UA 1), or two semesters of a laboratory science or Permission of Instructor. This course examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk: exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies focusing on sites, monuments, and materials. Major works in marble, metals, clay, glass, and ivory will be reviewed, along with criteria used to establish absolute and relative chronologies, including both scientific and stylistic analysis. A broad range of applied technologies, issues of authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are examined. Monuments are studied with special focus on developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, cultural heritage management, and high profile repatriation cases."}, {"content": "Foundation Requirement Courses            > Degree Requirements            > Undergraduate            > Academics         > NYU Gallatin                                                                                                                                  NYU Gallatin    Skip to Content   Skip to Search   Skip to Navigation   Skip to Sub Navigation                          Students          Prospective Students Current Undergraduate Students Current Graduate Students Incoming First-Year Students                            Faculty    Staff    Parents & Family    Alumni    |    Forms    Directory    Events Calendar                                                       Search                                                                           Main Navigation                Home      About    Facts and Figures    Facilities    Governance and Committees    Sustainability    From the Dean    Mission and Learning Goals    Administration    Bulletin 2014-2015    Bulletin Archive           Admissions    Undergraduate    Graduate           Academics    Undergraduate    Graduate    Courses    Faculty    Advising    Awards, Honors, and Fellowships    Policies and Procedures    Registration    Calendars and Deadlines           Global           Student Life    Community Service    Co-Curricular Programs    Graduation Ceremonies    A Diverse Intellectual Community    Health and Wellness    Living At NYU    Scholarly Communities    Student Government and Organizations    Student Profiles    Student Publications    Student Arts Showcases    Lecture Series    Senior Symposium    Fashion           Visit    Directions and Maps                                                                 Keyword &#9650;

ARTH-UA 409 Modern Architecture: 1914 to Present MW 9:30-10:45       Professor Krinsky 409 Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, ARTH-UA 408, ARTH-UA 601,   MAP-UA 722, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every   year. 4 points.   Chronological account of architecture and ideas since 1914. Considers   such subjects as currents on the eve of the First World War, new   technology, and the impact of the war; architecture and politics between   the wars; the rise of expressionist design; the international style and   the concurrent adaptation of traditional styles; art deco design;   mid-century glass curtain-wall architecture; brutalism; and reactions to   modernism. Includes ideological and political considerations and works   by Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Louis   Kahn, Alvar Aalto, Philip Johnson, James Stirling, Frank Gehry, and   Santiago Calatrava, among others. ARTH-UA 411 Neoclassicism to Realism          MW 2:00-3:15         Professor Mansfield  Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.        The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical   ways. On the one hand, the period\u2019s valorization of cool rationalism   contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the   18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by   the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form   of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its   emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product   of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of   romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of   romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic   movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century   artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but   its political consequences as well.      ARTH-UA 413 Cubism to Abstract Expressionism          TR 3:30-4:45         Professor Robinson  Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the   artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the   development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure   abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following   impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to   symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the arts and crafts movement,   fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are   analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that   generated them. ARTH-UA 450 section 1 Social History of Photography  TR 11:00-12:15         Professor Shelley Rice Identical to PHTI-UT 1101. Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2, ARTH-UA 6, or a   score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every fall. 4 points.   This course is a social and political history of photography, from its   beginnings to the present day. It focuses on the popular forms of   photographic imagery, such as advertising, fashion, travel photography,   family portraits and snapshots, scientific documents, documentary reform   and photojournalism, as well as describes the medium\u2019s relationship to   Western (and global) social history during the modern era. Brady,   Warhol, Capa, Nadar, Martin Chambi, Atget, Tomatsu, Muybridge, Curtis,   Bourke-White, Gordon Parks, \u00c1lvarez Bravo, and Berenice Abbott are in   the cast of characters to be discussed, and readings include those by   Susan Sontag, John Berger, and Roland Barthes, among others. ARTH-UA 450 section 2 Abstract Art 1910-2010 MW 11:00-12:15           Professor Karmel Prerequisite ARTH-UA 2 or ARTH-UA 6   with a   minimum grade of C. 4  points.    Abstraction is usually identified with the modernist idea that each art should be faithful to its own specific medium. Painters should therefore stick to arranging lines and colors on flat surfaces, and not be seduced into creating imaginary figures or illusionistic spaces. From this point of view, the history of abstraction begins around 1910 and ends around 1970 with the triumph of minimalism (a.k.a. \u201cthe end of art\u201d), because you can\u2019t get any flatter or more literal than that.  This \u201cmodernist\u201d account of abstraction no longer looks very convincing. For one thing, there have been four decades of abstraction since the supposed end of art in 1970. For another, it\u2019s become obvious that the wide variety of abstract paintings and sculptures made between 1910 and 2010 cannot be understood under simple rubrics such as \u201cpurity,\u201d \u201creductiveness,\u201d or \u201ctruth to medium.\u201d It has also become apparent that modernist abstraction is linked to 19th-century theories of perception, decoration, and symbolism.   This course will offer a new approach to the history of abstraction. Dividing the history of abstract art into three periods (1910-1945, 1945-1970, and 1970-2010), we will look not just at the official movements that emerge in each period, but also at the formal and thematic concerns that connect and divide artists in supposedly different movements.  Sorting abstract compositions into \u201cwebs,\u201d \u201cgrids,\u201d and \u201cblobs,\u201d we will follow formal inventions as they jump from one style to another. Examining the styles and themes shared by abstract and figurative artists, we will look at the apocalyptic subtext of early, expressionist abstraction; the utopian associations of the geometric grid; the surrealist imagery of biomorphic abstraction; the anthropological thinking behind the new American abstraction of the mid-century; the feminist ideology of \u201cdecorative\u201d abstraction after 1970; and the diverse allusions of contemporary abstraction, including maps, networks, bodily fluids, and graffiti.    V43.0511 East Asian Art II: China, Japan, Korea from 1000 CE to Present            TR 12:30-1:45 Professor Hsu Identical to EAST-UA 92. Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from   approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding   of the development of art and culture as well as mastery of specific   works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common   cultural heritage of the North East Asia region. Part of this   commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing   Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also   developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in   the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape   paintings, Edo \u201cfloating world\u201d prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art. ARTH-UA 560 Arts of Africa            MW 3:30-4:45           Professor Mount Identical to SCA-UA 787. Offered periodically. 4 points.   The traditional art of sub-Saharan Africa\u2014its diversity and cultural   contexts as well as its universal aspects\u2014is the subject of this course.   African art is studied in relation to its meaning and function in   traditional societies, wherein art has socialized and reinforced   religious beliefs, reflected male and female roles, and validated   systems of leadership. The course covers architecture, sculpture,   textiles, paintings, jewelry, and ceramics. Field trips to museums   and/or private collections supplement class lectures.

ARTH-UA 671 Architecture in Context     R 4:55-7:35       Professor White Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 601, ARTH-UA 661, and permission of the program director. 4 points.   Addresses issues arising from new structures and interventions to   existing structures, which must relate to existing well-defined contexts   of the sort found throughout New York City. Students are encouraged to   think about, discuss, create, and report on designs that recognize and   suit their contexts. The focus is on typical New York City building   types. Includes town houses, additions to existing structures, adaptive   reuse of residential structures for institutional use, streetscape   improvements, and urban parks. ARTH-UA 673 Urban Design: Infrastructure   M 6:20-8:50 Professor Haff Prerequisites: ARTH-UA 601, ARTH-UA 661, and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 4 points.    Serves as a laboratory for the investigation of New York City\u2019s   infrastructure, using the definition of the word as a point of   departure. In what ways can the city be perceived as a collective   undertaking, with intricate components interwoven in continuous strands?   What systems and forces give the city and its neighborhoods their   current form, and what influences their future shape? Can these systems   be dissected? What do these analyses tell us about the relationship of   the city to its inhabitants and to the wider environment? Through   lectures, reading assignments, discussions, and field trips, we   investigate some of the major components of the city\u2019s infrastructure,   such as the street grid, water supply, waste disposal, and subway   system.

The course assists students in creating a   comprehensive series of drawings and in building a portfolio. Advanced Seminar    Permission of the director of undergraduate studies required.  Open to departmental majors who are juniors and seniors, have completed the relevant survey course, and have completed one advanced course in a relevant subject area. Given every fall and spring. 4 points.    Exposure in small group discussion format to historical/critical  problem(s) of particular present concern to the faculty member offering  the seminar. Requires oral report(s) and/or a substantial paper.    ARTH-UA 800 section 1 Toward a Critical Vocabulary   T 2:00-5:00   Professor Shelley Rice This course takes as its main emphasis the analysis and synthesis of visual and written information. The readings include essays by critics Roland Barthes, Donna Haraway, Susan Sontag, Boris Groys and bell hooks (among others), as well as articles or excerpts by Thomas Kuhn, Mircea Eliade, John Berger and George Kubler. Critical essays are interspersed with other kinds of texts, like The Tibetan Book of the Dead , Persepolis , Black Elk Speaks and the novel Perfume. This mixture of topics, texts and issues is designed to broaden students\u2019 understanding of important concerns in philosophy, art history, science, literature, and cultural studies that are relevant to photography. Class time is spent in analysis of these texts in relation to historical and contemporary pictures.    ARTH-UA 800 section 2 Everyone's a Critic: Reading Art Criticism and How to Write Some Yourself W 9:30-12:15   Professor Plagens We'll both read and write art criticism. The reading--a course-pack of essays and reviews, with no textbook--will take us from some anti-modern reactionaries at the beginning of the 20th century, through mid-last-century's big names (Harold Rosenberg, Clement Greenberg, Robert Hughes), to some late modern and postmodern heavyweights (Rose, Foster), to contemporary reviewers such as Roberta Smith, to some necessary \"theory,\" politicized criticism, and up-to-the-minute reviews and blogs. The student writing will consist of three reviews, from 500 to 1500 words, and a final paper (essay). We'll \"workshop\" selected (by volunteering or chance) reviews in class, i.e., everyone will get a copy, the author will read it aloud, and we'll all pitch in to \"edit\" is, as if for publication. The class will have some visuals, one film, and occasional short quizzes on the reading. Some questions running through the course are: Are there any objective stands in art criticism, or is it all simply subjective opinion? What are the different kinds of art criticism, and who's the audience for them? What's the effect of the precipitous decline of print and the precipitous rise of the digital world on art criticism? Can honest and/or effective art criticism be practiced in today's hyper-market art world? How esoteric must writing about contemporary art be? Of what art-world career use is this course?  ARTH-UA 800 section 3 Holier than Thou: The Cult of Saints in Renaissance and Baroque Art      T 9:30-12:15   Professor L. Rice Promoted by the Church as paragons of virtue, saints exemplify the values, aspirations, and anxieties of the societies that venerated them. This seminar focuses on the cult of saints and its expression in the visual arts in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when Protestant resistance to the very notion of saints triggered a resurgence and reshaping of Catholic devotional practices. We will examine the origins of the cult of saints and its evolution over time; the veneration of saints' relics and the often contentious politics surrounding their authenticity and ownership; the revival of interest in the early Church and the rise of hagiography (the study of saints' lives) as a critical discipline; the persistence of Medieval subject matter and the introduction of new iconographic tropes; saint-making in the early modern era and its impact on the history of Renaissance and Baroque art and architecture.  ARTH-UA 800 section 5 Media as Medium: Strategies in Contemporary Art from the Nineties to Now    M 2:00-4:45   Professor Robinson Contemporary art since the 1990s has generated meaning in relation to changing global frameworks and technologies. Rather than shaping forms, it places objects in circulation. We no longer read art in terms of one medium \u2013 painting, sculpture, photography, film \u2013 but the prospect of many media at once, mobilized as an intervention into ever-changing fields of communication. It is the argument of this seminar that current artistic practice might best be read as a set of \u201cstrategies.\u201d In the ever-expanding media landscape of the present, art works operate with the same codes as those of the world beyond them, create meaning in the same ways, and enter our consciousness through global channels that are in wide use. This seminar will consider contemporary art since the 1990s as a set of strategies and interventions. It will look at the social/political/mediatic frameworks surrounding a range of recent projects. We examine systematically how artistic practice today is dependent on such larger structures, situations, and contexts. The artists we focus on - treated monographically, week by week, are grouped in terms of their strategies, and the discursive concepts that have emerged as a result. Strategies we will consider are: the photographic, the performative, the utopia of the participatory, post studio/ post medium, interjection in global networks, and collective or group-based actions/events. Artists covered include: Douglas Gordon, Doug Aitken, Steve McQueen, Damien Hirst, Gabriel Orozco, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Liam Gillick, Pierre Huyghe, Zoe Leonard, Emily Jacir, Maria Eichhorn. ARTH-UA 800 section 6 Exhibitions: Curating and Displaying Global Art      W 3:30-6:10   Professor Basilio In this seminar we will analyze contemporary developments in global exhibitions, primarily biennials. To do this, we will first briefly look at the history of World's Fairs, and the beginning of the Venice Biennial, Sao Paulo Biennial, and Documenta. We will then focus on case studies of specific highly influential editions of such exhibitions and the creation of biennials in other locations, such as Havana or Shanghai.  ARTH-UA 801 Senior Honors Thesis    R 2:00-4:45   Professor Serdari    Open to departmental majors who have been accepted as candidates  for honors in art history in the first term of their senior year and  who have the permission of the director of undergraduate studies.

Permission of Insturctor required. 4  points . Prerequisite: Introduction to Classical Archaeology (V27.0305), or Archaeologies of Greece (V27.0352), or Introduction to Ancient Art (V43.0003 or ARTH-UA 3, identical to V27.0310), or History of Western Art I (V43.0001 or ARTH-UA 1), or two semesters of a laboratory science or Permission of Instructor. This course examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk: exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies focusing on sites, monuments, and materials. Major works in marble, metals, clay, glass, and ivory will be reviewed, along with criteria used to establish absolute and relative chronologies, including both scientific and stylistic analysis. A broad range of applied technologies, issues of authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are examined. Monuments are studied with special focus on developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, cultural heritage management, and high profile repatriation cases."}, {"content": "Foundation Requirement Courses            > Degree Requirements            > Undergraduate            > Academics         > NYU Gallatin                                                                                                                                  NYU Gallatin    Skip to Content   Skip to Search   Skip to Navigation   Skip to Sub Navigation                          Students          Prospective Students Current Undergraduate Students Current Graduate Students Incoming First-Year Students                            Faculty    Staff    Parents & Family    Alumni    |    Forms    Directory    Events Calendar                                                       Search                                                                           Main Navigation                Home      About    Facts and Figures    Facilities    Governance and Committees    Sustainability    From the Dean    Mission and Learning Goals    Administration    Bulletin 2014-2015    Bulletin Archive           Admissions    Undergraduate    Graduate           Academics    Undergraduate    Graduate    Courses    Faculty    Advising    Awards, Honors, and Fellowships    Policies and Procedures    Registration    Calendars and Deadlines           Global           Student Life    Community Service    Co-Curricular Programs    Graduation Ceremonies    A Diverse Intellectual Community    Health and Wellness    Living At NYU    Scholarly Communities    Student Government and Organizations    Student Profiles    Student Publications    Student Arts Showcases    Lecture Series    Senior Symposium    Fashion           Visit    Directions and Maps                                                                 Keyword &#9650;
