Spend time planning and organizing.  Using time to think and plan is time well-spent. In fact, if you fail to take time for planning, you are, in effect, planning to fail. Organize in a way that makes sense to you. If you need color and pictures, use a lot on your calendar or planning book. Some people need to have papers filed away; others get their creative energy from their piles. So forget the &quot;shoulds&quot; and organize your way.          2. Set Goals.  Goals give your life, and the way you spend your time, direction. Set goals which are specific, measurable, realistic and achievable. Your optimum goals are those which cause you to &quot;stretch&quot; but not &quot;break&quot; as you strive for achievement. Goals can give creative people a much-needed sense of direction.          3. Prioritize.  Use the 80-20 Rule originally stated by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who noted that 80 percent of the reward comes from 20 percent of the effort. The trick to prioritizing is to isolate and identify that valuable 20 percent. Once identified, prioritize time to concentrate your effort on those items with the greatest reward. Prioritize by color, number or letter \u2014 whichever method makes the most sense to you. Flagging items with a deadline is another idea for helping you stick to your priorities.          4. Use a to-do list.  Some people thrive on using a daily To Do list which they construct either the last thing the previous day or first thing in the morning. Such people may combine a To Do list with a calendar or schedule. Others prefer a &quot;running&quot; To Do list which is continuously being updated. Or, you may prefer a combination of the two previously described To Do lists. Whatever method works is best for you. Don't be afraid to try a new system \u2014 you just might find one that works even better than your present one!          5. Be flexible.  Allow time for interruptions and distractions. Time management experts often suggest planning for just 50 percent or less of one's time. With only 50 percent of your time planned, you will have the flexibility to handle interruptions and the unplanned &quot;emergency.&quot; When you expect to be interrupted, schedule routine tasks. Save (or make) larger blocks of time for your priorities. When interrupted, ask Alan Lakein's crucial question, &quot;What is the most important thing I can be doing with my time right now?&quot; to help you get back on track fast.        6. Consider your biological prime time.  That's the time of day when you are at your best. Are you a &quot;morning person,&quot; a &quot;night owl,&quot; or a late afternoon &quot;whiz?&quot; Knowing when your best time is and planning to use that time of day for your priorities (if possible) is effective time management.        7. Do the right thing right.  Noted management expert, Peter Drucker, says &quot;doing the right thing is more important than doing things right.&quot; Doing the right thing is effectiveness; doing things right is efficiency. Focus first on effectiveness (identifying what is the right thing to do), then concentrate on efficiency (doing it right).          8. Eliminate the urgent.  Urgent tasks have short-term consequences while important tasks are those with long-term, goal-related implications. Work towards reducing the urgent things you must do so you'll have time for your important priorities. Flagging or highlighting items on your To Do list or attaching a deadline to each item may help keep important items from becoming urgent emergencies.        9. Practice the art of intelligent neglect.  Eliminate from your life trivial tasks or those tasks which do not have long-term consequences for you. Can you delegate or eliminate any of your To Do list? Work on those tasks which you alone can do.          10. Avoid being a perfectionist.  In the Malaysian culture, only the gods are considered capable of producing anything perfect. Whenever something is made, a flaw is left on purpose so the gods will not be offended. Yes, some things need to be closer to perfect than others, but perfectionism, paying unnecessary attention to detail, can be a form of procrastination.          11. Conquer procrastination.  One technique to try is the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; method described by Alan Lakein. When you are avoiding something, break it into smaller tasks and do just one of the smaller tasks or set a timer and work on the big task for just 15 minutes. By doing a little at a time, eventually you'll reach a point where you'll want to finish.          12. Learn to say &quot;No.&quot;  Such a small word \u2014 and so hard to say. Focusing on your goals may help. Blocking time for important, but often not scheduled, priorities such as family and friends can also help. But first you must be convinced that you and your priorities are important \u2014 that seems to be the hardest part in learning to say &quot;no.&quot; Once convinced of their importance, saying &quot;no&quot; to the unimportant in life gets easier.          13. Reward yourself.  Even for small successes, celebrate achievement of goals. Promise yourself a reward for completing each task, or finishing the total job. Then keep your promise to yourself and indulge in your reward. Doing so will help you maintain the necessary balance in life between work and play. As Ann McGee-Cooper says, &quot;If we learn to balance excellence in work with excellence in play, fun, and relaxation, our lives become happier, healthier, and a great deal more creative.&quot;          Resources  Drucker, Peter.

Spend time planning and organizing.  Using time to think and plan is time well-spent. In fact, if you fail to take time for planning, you are, in effect, planning to fail. Organize in a way that makes sense to you. If you need color and pictures, use a lot on your calendar or planning book. Some people need to have papers filed away; others get their creative energy from their piles. So forget the &quot;shoulds&quot; and organize your way.          2. Set Goals.  Goals give your life, and the way you spend your time, direction. Set goals which are specific, measurable, realistic and achievable. Your optimum goals are those which cause you to &quot;stretch&quot; but not &quot;break&quot; as you strive for achievement. Goals can give creative people a much-needed sense of direction.          3. Prioritize.  Use the 80-20 Rule originally stated by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto who noted that 80 percent of the reward comes from 20 percent of the effort. The trick to prioritizing is to isolate and identify that valuable 20 percent. Once identified, prioritize time to concentrate your effort on those items with the greatest reward. Prioritize by color, number or letter \u2014 whichever method makes the most sense to you. Flagging items with a deadline is another idea for helping you stick to your priorities.          4. Use a to-do list.  Some people thrive on using a daily To Do list which they construct either the last thing the previous day or first thing in the morning. Such people may combine a To Do list with a calendar or schedule. Others prefer a &quot;running&quot; To Do list which is continuously being updated. Or, you may prefer a combination of the two previously described To Do lists. Whatever method works is best for you. Don't be afraid to try a new system \u2014 you just might find one that works even better than your present one!          5. Be flexible.  Allow time for interruptions and distractions. Time management experts often suggest planning for just 50 percent or less of one's time. With only 50 percent of your time planned, you will have the flexibility to handle interruptions and the unplanned &quot;emergency.&quot; When you expect to be interrupted, schedule routine tasks. Save (or make) larger blocks of time for your priorities. When interrupted, ask Alan Lakein's crucial question, &quot;What is the most important thing I can be doing with my time right now?&quot; to help you get back on track fast.        6. Consider your biological prime time.  That's the time of day when you are at your best. Are you a &quot;morning person,&quot; a &quot;night owl,&quot; or a late afternoon &quot;whiz?&quot; Knowing when your best time is and planning to use that time of day for your priorities (if possible) is effective time management.        7. Do the right thing right.  Noted management expert, Peter Drucker, says &quot;doing the right thing is more important than doing things right.&quot; Doing the right thing is effectiveness; doing things right is efficiency. Focus first on effectiveness (identifying what is the right thing to do), then concentrate on efficiency (doing it right).          8. Eliminate the urgent.  Urgent tasks have short-term consequences while important tasks are those with long-term, goal-related implications. Work towards reducing the urgent things you must do so you'll have time for your important priorities. Flagging or highlighting items on your To Do list or attaching a deadline to each item may help keep important items from becoming urgent emergencies.        9. Practice the art of intelligent neglect.  Eliminate from your life trivial tasks or those tasks which do not have long-term consequences for you. Can you delegate or eliminate any of your To Do list? Work on those tasks which you alone can do.          10. Avoid being a perfectionist.  In the Malaysian culture, only the gods are considered capable of producing anything perfect. Whenever something is made, a flaw is left on purpose so the gods will not be offended. Yes, some things need to be closer to perfect than others, but perfectionism, paying unnecessary attention to detail, can be a form of procrastination.          11. Conquer procrastination.  One technique to try is the &quot;Swiss cheese&quot; method described by Alan Lakein. When you are avoiding something, break it into smaller tasks and do just one of the smaller tasks or set a timer and work on the big task for just 15 minutes. By doing a little at a time, eventually you'll reach a point where you'll want to finish.          12. Learn to say &quot;No.&quot;  Such a small word \u2014 and so hard to say. Focusing on your goals may help. Blocking time for important, but often not scheduled, priorities such as family and friends can also help. But first you must be convinced that you and your priorities are important \u2014 that seems to be the hardest part in learning to say &quot;no.&quot; Once convinced of their importance, saying &quot;no&quot; to the unimportant in life gets easier.          13. Reward yourself.  Even for small successes, celebrate achievement of goals. Promise yourself a reward for completing each task, or finishing the total job. Then keep your promise to yourself and indulge in your reward. Doing so will help you maintain the necessary balance in life between work and play. As Ann McGee-Cooper says, &quot;If we learn to balance excellence in work with excellence in play, fun, and relaxation, our lives become happier, healthier, and a great deal more creative.&quot;          Resources  Drucker, Peter.

Technically, prone radiation therapy is complex, requiring expertise in patient immobilization, table design, simulation and treatment. \u00a0At NYU, we have over 14 years of experience in treating patients in the prone position. \u00a0Although this course has been offered a number of times over the past several years, there are still a great number of clinicians who are not treating in the prone position and who need to be educated in this modality.   The\u00a0 NYU Prone Breast Radiotherapy Technique \u00a0course will provide an overview of the rationale for and practical, \u201chands-on\u201d teaching of the NYU prone treatment technique. \u00a0The NYU Radiation Oncology protocols, which utilize IMRT planning techniques for both partial, whole breast and nodal treatment in the prone position, will be described. \u00a0In addition, the organ dose exposure to heart and lung will be outlined.   The course will be structured over 2 days, the first of which will include didactic lectures on the protocols utilized and methodology, while the second day sessions will include hands-on teaching of techniques with ample time for questions and answers, demonstrations and real-time application of learned methodologies of prone breast treatment.   \u00a0   Target Audience The course is targeted at radiation oncologists, physicists and therapists interested in learning the prone technique for external beam breast cancer radiation therapy. \u00a0   \u00a0   Refund Policy In order to request a refund, you must \u00a0 click here \u00a0 to complete and submit our online refund form no later than 14 days prior to the first day of the course. An administrative fee of $75 will be deducted from your refund. Cancelations or no-shows after this date are not eligible for a refund. Fax and email cancelations are not accepted.   \u00a0   Course Cancelation Policy In the unusual circumstance that this course is canceled, two weeks notice will be given and tuition will be refunded in full.
