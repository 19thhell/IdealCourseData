To foster a unique global perspective, the BPE program includes two full semesters of global study at NYU's campus in London during your sophomore year.      For Class of 2017 and preceding classes: You have a required junior semester of global study in Shanghai- deepening your understanding of emerging markets - or Washington, D.C. - exposing you to a political hub with a unique internship program in public policy or business.    For Class of 2018 and beyond: You have the option of spending your junior fall semester in New York, Shanghai, Washington, D.C, or any other NYU site where you will be able to fulfill the BPE requirements.    The degree culminates in a senior capstone project.    Beginning with the Class of 2017, the BPE curriculum requirements also include the International Studies Program (ISP) and 'Organizational Communication and Its Social Context.'

Students also travel oversees as part of the ISP program during junior year.    The Economics Core exposes students to the major concepts, tools and debates of economics today, with a strong focus on global economic linkages and trends. Students take microeconomics, macroeconomics, and more advanced courses in international economics and emerging markets.    The Politics Core introduces students to the study of politics. Coursework covers political theory, comparative politics, and international relations. Classes stress the challenges of globalization as well as focus on how politics, economics, and business interact at the international level.

For Class of 2017 and preceding classes: You have a required junior semester of global study in Shanghai- deepening your understanding of emerging markets - or Washington, D.C. - exposing you to a political hub with a unique internship program in public policy or business.    For Class of 2018 and beyond: You have the option of spending your junior fall semester in New York, Shanghai, Washington, D.C, or any other NYU site where you will be able to fulfill the BPE requirements.     In this program, you will earn a major in business and political economy    The Business Core provides an introduction to the key business disciplines of accounting, finance, and marketing, as well as an introduction to international business. After completing these business fundamentals, students may choose advanced business courses to complete some of the Stern elective requirements. Students also travel oversees as part of the ISP program during junior year.    The Economics Core exposes students to the major concepts, tools and debates of economics today, with a strong focus on global economic linkages and trends. Students take microeconomics, macroeconomics, and more advanced courses in international economics and emerging markets.    The Politics Core introduces students to the study of politics. Coursework covers political theory, comparative politics, and international relations. Classes stress the challenges of globalization as well as focus on how politics, economics, and business interact at the international level.    The Social Impact Core is a four-course sequence focusing on issues of personal and professional ethics; corporate social responsibility; the role of law in business and commerce; and the interconnections between corporations, markets, cultures, governments, and our global society. Coursework emphasizes writing, debate, and discussion. Students take 'Organizational Communication and Its Social Context' during sophomore year as part of the four-course Social Impact Core.     Liberal Arts Core, the cornerstone of the Stern curriculum, is a solid grounding in the liberal arts and sciences. For students in the BPE Program, the Liberal Arts Core includes five courses designed to hone critical reading and writing skills, promote creative and logical thinking and heighten cultural awareness, with a focus on the regions in which students will study abroad.
