 I had heard that January Term would be a break from the regular semesters, so I was looking forward to a chance to relax and enjoy some free time. But in reality, my J-Term 2015 course Food in the Global Kitchen , was the most intense three weeks of my university career to date.                         My class mates and I were pushed to read about food, write about food, and explore the diverse city of Abu Dhabi in search of food; and every second of it was thrilling!   From the falafel wars to George Orwell's restaurant experiences, there was no lack of stimulating foodie conversation. My favorite part, I must admit, were the expeditions into little known Abu Dhabi restaurants organized by our amazing professor Annia Ciezaldo \u2014 author of Day of Honey: A Memoir of Food, Love, and War . The mission to find the next best dish was a great way to bond as a class and to explore the exciting world of food in Abu Dhabi.

 I had heard that January Term would be a break from the regular semesters, so I was looking forward to a chance to relax and enjoy some free time. But in reality, my J-Term 2015 course Food in the Global Kitchen , was the most intense three weeks of my university career to date.                         My class mates and I were pushed to read about food, write about food, and explore the diverse city of Abu Dhabi in search of food; and every second of it was thrilling!   From the falafel wars to George Orwell's restaurant experiences, there was no lack of stimulating foodie conversation. My favorite part, I must admit, were the expeditions into little known Abu Dhabi restaurants organized by our amazing professor Annia Ciezaldo \u2014 author of Day of Honey: A Memoir of Food, Love, and War . The mission to find the next best dish was a great way to bond as a class and to explore the exciting world of food in Abu Dhabi.

Comments (0)                                         Search terms to try                 Sometimes, it helps to use what's called a \"controlled vocabulary\" when searching. Try one or more of these terms:     cookery   cooking   food habits   diet   food supply     If you are researching a particular ingredient, try searching the ingredient as a subject. If this search returns too many results, try \"cooking ingredient\" as a subject. For example, if researching asparagus, you could search cooking asparagus in the subject. This will retreive results only about asparagus as a food used in cooking, not asparagus as a plant that is grown, sold, exported, etc.           Comments (0)                                         Dictionaries and Encyclopedias                 Dictionaries and Encyclopdias can be a great place to start your research.

Ranging from the eating habits of our prehistoric ancestors to food-related policy issues we face today, this work covers the full spectrum of foods that have been hunted, gathered, cultivated, and domesticated; their nutritional makeup and uses; and their impact on cultures and demography. It offers a geographical perspective on the history and culture of food and drink and takes up subjects from food fads, prejudices, and taboos to questions of food toxins, additives, labeling, and entitlements. It culminates in a dictionary that identifies and sketches out brief histories of plant foods mentioned in the text - over 1,000 in all - and additionally supplies thousands of common names and synonyms for those foods.
