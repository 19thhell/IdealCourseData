Semester: Spring, Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           The purpose of the course is to deepen students\u2019 understanding of the way in which public policy and political realities interact in American government at the national, state, and local levels: how political pressures limit policy choices, how policy choices in turn reshape politics, and how policymakers can function in the interplay of competing forces. The theme explored is how public officials balance concerns for substantive policy objectives, institutional politics and elective politics in order to achieve change. The nature of key legislative and executive institutional objectives and roles is examined. In addition, attention is given to the role of policy analysis and analysts in shaping policy decisions, seeking to identify their potential for positive impact and their limitations in the political process.      A second goal of the course is to sharpen students\u2019 ability to think and write like professional policy analysts. Students will be asked to apply both a policy analysis framework and a political perspective to the issues under discussion    Prerequisites: CORE-GP.1022                     Semester     Instructor     Syllabus Link         Spring 2012 John Gershman Syllabus  Fall 2011  Syllabus  Spring 2010  Syllabus  Spring 2009  Syllabus  Spring 2009  Syllabus  Fall 2008  Syllabus                         Semester     Instructor     Evaluation Link         Fall 2014 Neil Kleiman Evaluation  Spring 2014 Carrie Nordlund Evaluation  Fall 2013 Robert M.
