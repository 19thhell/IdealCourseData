To address this incredibly high burden of disease, NYUCD partnered with Grenada\u2019s Ministries of Health and Education to design Smile Grenada: a national school-based oral health program that incorporated prevention strategies including daily classroom tooth-brushing routines, education, fluoride varnish and sealants.   Support from Colgate Palmolive and GC America enabled a two-and-a-half year implementation that reached 26,000 children in all of Grenada\u2019s schools. NYUCD worked alongside Grenadian public health dentists, dental hygienists, and auxiliaries to train and build capacity among the school and public health systems to prevent oral disease in a sustainable manner.   In 2013, these efforts resulted in a 90% decrease in new tooth decay. Smile Grenada is to date the most profound example of the capacity of the NYUCD/Henry Schein Cares Global Student Outreach Program and its contribution to oral health research and promotion.

To address this incredibly high burden of disease, NYUCD partnered with Grenada\u2019s Ministries of Health and Education to design Smile Grenada: a national school-based oral health program that incorporated prevention strategies including daily classroom tooth-brushing routines, education, fluoride varnish and sealants.   Support from Colgate Palmolive and GC America enabled a two-and-a-half year implementation that reached 26,000 children in all of Grenada\u2019s schools. NYUCD worked alongside Grenadian public health dentists, dental hygienists, and auxiliaries to train and build capacity among the school and public health systems to prevent oral disease in a sustainable manner.   In 2013, these efforts resulted in a 90% decrease in new tooth decay. Smile Grenada is to date the most profound example of the capacity of the NYUCD/Henry Schein Cares Global Student Outreach Program and its contribution to oral health research and promotion.

It shows step-by-step how to \u201cweave\u201d oral health content, teaching-learning strategies, and clinical experiences into pediatric, adult-gerontology, family, women\u2019s health, and psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner and midwifery programs.   \u201cOral-systemic health is the perfect exemplar for developing interprofessional education experiences,\u201d says. Erin Hartnett DNP, APRN-BC, CPNP, program director for NYUCN Oral Health Programs, OHNEP, and Teaching Oral Systemic Health (TOSH) Programs. \u201cEach template takes the student from oral health exposure in the classroom to immersion in live or simulated clinical experiences. Additional interprofessional service learning experiences, as well as health literacy, advocacy, and policy activities are also included in our Toolkit.\u201d   OHNEP leaders also stress that it is important for nurse practitioners and midwives on the frontline of primary care to have the interprofessional oral health competencies necessary to recognize and diagnose both normal and abnormal oral conditions and provide patients with treatment including, prevention, education, and referral as needed.

To address this incredibly high burden of disease, NYUCD partnered with Grenada\u2019s Ministries of Health and Education to design Smile Grenada: a national school-based oral health program that incorporated prevention strategies including daily classroom tooth-brushing routines, education, fluoride varnish and sealants.   Support from Colgate Palmolive and GC America enabled a two-and-a-half year implementation that reached 26,000 children in all of Grenada\u2019s schools. NYUCD worked alongside Grenadian public health dentists, dental hygienists, and auxiliaries to train and build capacity among the school and public health systems to prevent oral disease in a sustainable manner.   In 2013, these efforts resulted in a 90% decrease in new tooth decay. Smile Grenada is to date the most profound example of the capacity of the NYUCD/Henry Schein Cares Global Student Outreach Program and its contribution to oral health research and promotion.

It shows step-by-step how to \u201cweave\u201d oral health content, teaching-learning strategies, and clinical experiences into pediatric, adult-gerontology, family, women\u2019s health, and psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner and midwifery programs.   \u201cOral-systemic health is the perfect exemplar for developing interprofessional education experiences,\u201d says. Erin Hartnett DNP, APRN-BC, CPNP, program director for NYUCN Oral Health Programs, OHNEP, and Teaching Oral Systemic Health (TOSH) Programs. \u201cEach template takes the student from oral health exposure in the classroom to immersion in live or simulated clinical experiences. Additional interprofessional service learning experiences, as well as health literacy, advocacy, and policy activities are also included in our Toolkit.\u201d   OHNEP leaders also stress that it is important for nurse practitioners and midwives on the frontline of primary care to have the interprofessional oral health competencies necessary to recognize and diagnose both normal and abnormal oral conditions and provide patients with treatment including, prevention, education, and referral as needed.
