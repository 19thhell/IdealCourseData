Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare.

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.

To meet this challenge, we have created two dual certification programs that are at the cutting edge of the profession:       Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education (Grades 1-6)    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education (Birth-Grade 2)       This design recognizes that whether our graduates choose to work in general education settings, special education settings, or inclusive settings, they need to share a set of common understandings. Thus, our students acquire a firm knowledge base in human development and variability in development. They acquire knowledge and skills for providing enriching, child-centered educational environments and learn how to adapt those environments to meet the needs of the diverse students in their classes.    Graduates from these dual certification programs share visions for their students. They acquire the collaborative skills to realize those visions with teachers, parents, and other education and health professionals. In short, NYU's integrated, dual certification programs model the process its graduates will use throughout their careers.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.     NYU Steinhardt Graduates in Education Ranked among the Highest Paid by USA Today      How to Apply      asd nest support project at NYU Steinhardt          B.S. in Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education     Opening Doors and Supporting the Diverse Needs of Learners    The Certification Program in Childhood and Childhood Special Education is designed to prepare teachers for teaching in both childhood (elementary) and special education settings. Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professions to teach children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of instructional environments.    Focusing on How Children Learn and Develop    Our Certification Programs in Childhood and Childhood Special Education in the Department of Teaching and Learning is an urban-centered and field-based program that gives a thorough command of an integrated curriculum grounded in a deep understanding of children's growth and development, with an emphasis on human variability. You will have practical experience in the field, and you will gain mastery of the various content areas of the elementary curriculum (mathematics, science, social studies and language arts), as well as learn to create and adapt learning environments that allow all children to grow to their maximum potential.    Strong Emphasis on the Liberal Arts    A solid foundation in a wide range of liberal arts subjects and expertise in one area of the liberal arts are critical to your development as a first-rate teacher. With our liberal arts core and the 30-point liberal arts concentration required by New York State for teacher certification, our baccalaureate program ensures that you will receive the best possible preparation to be a teacher. For your liberal arts concentration, you choose from such areas as history, literacy, science, psychology, and from many other offerings in NYU's College of Arts and Science . Additionally, through NYU Steinhardt, your knowledge of teaching children will be supported by courses in human development, educational foundations, and inquiry-based education.    Study Abroad    We strongly encourage study abroad for all students. London, UK and Accra, Ghana are our academic partner sites. We offer the required course, \"Human Development,\" through NYU in London and NYU-Accra for teacher education students. The course includes weekly observations in British or Ghanaian schools and classrooms for first-hand learning in the local context. Students typically combine this course with three liberal-arts electives for an unforgettable semester-long experience.    Students may also spend a semester abroad at one of NYU's many other study abroad sites .    Student Activities    From your first year, your involvement in departmental activities will round out your learning. You may join the Special Education Club, which is a chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children, and the Future Education Club, which is available to all initial students in the department. You may also take advantage of various departmental seminars and social activities concerned with the education of children. Students are also encouraged to join The Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development's Undergraduate Student Government.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.
