from a range of studies investigating attachment processes in adults and children with an emphasis on clinical work. A highlight of the morning's proceedings will be a report on the London Parent-Child Project, one of the world's major longitudinal studies of intergenerational patterns of attachment that spans nearly 20 years.   Video-film illustrations will be used to address the legacy of early attachments upon emotional and social well being (or lacks thereof) across time. This presentation will track the long-term influences of mothers and fathers upon their first-born child.   The second part of the presentation will focus on a unique study of the process of the developing attachment relationships between previously maltreated children and their new adoptive parents. Attachment representations of both mothers and fathers are assessed. Clinical implications will be discussed with a view on how to assess change and the impact of trauma in both parents and children.   The third presentation will focus on demonstrating the efficacy of an attachment-based intervention designed for working with high risk, multi-problem families. This intervention was specifically developed for an urban population of young parents, with childhood histories of foster care placement, physical and/or sexual abuse, parental substance abuse, parental mental health problems, incarceration and domestic violence who are at risk for child maltreatment.   This Conference has ample opportunities for audience questions and participation.    The registration fee for this conference is $125. A 25% discount is available for alumni, field instructors and educational coordinators. NYU Silver MSW students may attend at a discounted rate of $40; MSW students enrolled at other schools for $65.

from a range of studies investigating attachment processes in adults and children with an emphasis on clinical work. A highlight of the morning's proceedings will be a report on the London Parent-Child Project, one of the world's major longitudinal studies of intergenerational patterns of attachment that spans nearly 20 years.   Video-film illustrations will be used to address the legacy of early attachments upon emotional and social well being (or lacks thereof) across time. This presentation will track the long-term influences of mothers and fathers upon their first-born child.   The second part of the presentation will focus on a unique study of the process of the developing attachment relationships between previously maltreated children and their new adoptive parents. Attachment representations of both mothers and fathers are assessed. Clinical implications will be discussed with a view on how to assess change and the impact of trauma in both parents and children.   The third presentation will focus on demonstrating the efficacy of an attachment-based intervention designed for working with high risk, multi-problem families. This intervention was specifically developed for an urban population of young parents, with childhood histories of foster care placement, physical and/or sexual abuse, parental substance abuse, parental mental health problems, incarceration and domestic violence who are at risk for child maltreatment.   This Conference has ample opportunities for audience questions and participation.    The registration fee for this conference is $125. A 25% discount is available for alumni, field instructors and educational coordinators. NYU Silver MSW students may attend at a discounted rate of $40; MSW students enrolled at other schools for $65.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

from a range of studies investigating attachment processes in adults and children with an emphasis on clinical work. A highlight of the morning's proceedings will be a report on the London Parent-Child Project, one of the world's major longitudinal studies of intergenerational patterns of attachment that spans nearly 20 years.   Video-film illustrations will be used to address the legacy of early attachments upon emotional and social well being (or lacks thereof) across time. This presentation will track the long-term influences of mothers and fathers upon their first-born child.   The second part of the presentation will focus on a unique study of the process of the developing attachment relationships between previously maltreated children and their new adoptive parents. Attachment representations of both mothers and fathers are assessed. Clinical implications will be discussed with a view on how to assess change and the impact of trauma in both parents and children.   The third presentation will focus on demonstrating the efficacy of an attachment-based intervention designed for working with high risk, multi-problem families. This intervention was specifically developed for an urban population of young parents, with childhood histories of foster care placement, physical and/or sexual abuse, parental substance abuse, parental mental health problems, incarceration and domestic violence who are at risk for child maltreatment.   This Conference has ample opportunities for audience questions and participation.    The registration fee for this conference is $125. A 25% discount is available for alumni, field instructors and educational coordinators. NYU Silver MSW students may attend at a discounted rate of $40; MSW students enrolled at other schools for $65.

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.

Specifically, it will focus on the growing cross talk between basic science research and clinical oncology for development of novel approaches in managing cancer patients (both from diagnostic and therapeutic stand points).    The course's overarching objective is to transmit the importance of collaboration across oncology disciplines and fostering crosstalk between basic scientists and clinicians. It is also designed to review new therapeutic approaches to cancer and cultivate discussion about how clinicians can formulate ideas through basic science research collaborations.\u00a0    The first half of the course (which will end with an MCQ mid-term exam) will lay the ground on the general principles of oncology (cancer biology, pathology, principles of chemotherapy, radiotherapy and drug discovery). The second half of the course will focus on specific cancer modules (GI, breast, bladder, melanoma and lung cancer) with an interdisciplinary focus. The course will meet twice a week, be 90 minutes long and take place in a lecture (~60 minutes) and discussion (~30 minutes) format. This year the course will be held 5:30-7:00pm on Monday and Wednesday in MSB 588, unless otherwise noted.
