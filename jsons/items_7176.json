On the shield, the god Hephaestos represented the whole earth, the sun and moon, the constellations, the Ocean that encircles the world, the cities of men, and their farms, festivals, and wars. Achilles\u2019 shield introduces questions about the ways in which the world and the cosmos were understood in the ancient world and the contexts that produced these understandings. How did different ancient sources represent the world and the relationship of the world to the heavenly bodies? What were the organizational principles and goals that governed these representations? As scientific knowledge expands, how do popular conceptions of the world adapt to this new information? And in the absence of maps, which have largely not survived from antiquity, how might other kinds of visual and textual evidence reveal how people thought about geographical relationships, as well as related relationships between centers and frontiers, peoples familiar and foreign, and the earth and heavens? This course investigates ancient scientific and mathematical theories on the extent and shape of the world alongside other kinds of representations\u2014poetic, political, religious, material, and visual.

Her research has taken her to Greece, Italy, Turkey, Egypt and Bulgaria, where she is currently involved in the American Research Center in Sofia's excavations at the ancient Macedonian city of Heraclea Sintica. At Gallatin, her teaching interests focus on the intersection of ancient texts and material culture, and include classes on ancient portraiture, visual narrative, concepts of the outsider and cultural memory. Her first book, titled Hunters, Heroes, Kings, investigates the ways that the ancient kingdom of Macedonia drew from various cultural traditions in the visual expression of its self-identity.                News       Professor Franks was awarded a 2015 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece where she will conduct research on her upcoming book project, The Space of the Symposium: Mosaics and Movement in the Greek Andron .   Professor Franks convened the Gallatin Global Faculty Symposium &quot;The Material Archive,&quot; in Florence, Italy March 19-21, 2015, at NYU Florence.   Professor Franks was a guest lecturer and leader of a 2013 field trip to Greece through the Archaeological Field School at Heraclea Sintica, a school which she also co-directs. She and Matt Stanley were awarded a Curriculum Development Grant for \u201cAchilles\u2019 Shield: Mapping the Ancient Cosmos,\u201d a new course that they will co-teach in the spring of 2015.                           top of page                                     Contact Information     Hallie Franks             Assistant Professor              hmf2@nyu.edu             1 Wash Pl, Room 603             (212) 998-7333      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours         Monday 1-2:30             Tuesday 9:30-12                                                           Courses                                                   2015             Spring                            Achilles&#039; Shield: Mapping the Ancient Cosmos                  Mon,Wed      11:00 AM -      12:15 PM                                                   2014             Spring                            First-Year Research Seminar: The Place of the Past in Cultural Identity                  Mon,Wed      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                    Myths as Images from the Ancient World to Shakespeare                  Mon,Wed      12:30 PM -      1:45 PM                                                   2014             Fall                            Reading the Faces of Ancient Cultures                  Mon,Wed      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                                   2013             Fall                            Reading the Faces of Ancient Cultures                  Mon,Wed      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       material cultures (art and archaeology) of ancient Greece, Rome, and the Near East; cultural definition through art; and cultural exchange and interaction                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

On the shield, the god Hephaestos represented the whole earth, the sun and moon, the constellations, the Ocean that encircles the world, the cities of men, and their farms, festivals, and wars. Achilles\u2019 shield introduces questions about the ways in which the world and the cosmos were understood in the ancient world and the contexts that produced these understandings. How did different ancient sources represent the world and the relationship of the world to the heavenly bodies? What were the organizational principles and goals that governed these representations? As scientific knowledge expands, how do popular conceptions of the world adapt to this new information? And in the absence of maps, which have largely not survived from antiquity, how might other kinds of visual and textual evidence reveal how people thought about geographical relationships, as well as related relationships between centers and frontiers, peoples familiar and foreign, and the earth and heavens? This course investigates ancient scientific and mathematical theories on the extent and shape of the world alongside other kinds of representations\u2014poetic, political, religious, material, and visual. Primary sources may include: Homer\u00a0 Iliad \u00a0, Alcman, Plato\u00a0 Timaeus \u00a0, Aristotle\u00a0 De Caelo \u00a0, Herodotus, Hanno\u2019s Periplous, Ptolemy, Strabo, Pomponius Mela, Copernicus, Giordano Bruno, Gallileo.

Her research has taken her to Greece, Italy, Turkey, Egypt and Bulgaria, where she is currently involved in the American Research Center in Sofia's excavations at the ancient Macedonian city of Heraclea Sintica. At Gallatin, her teaching interests focus on the intersection of ancient texts and material culture, and include classes on ancient portraiture, visual narrative, concepts of the outsider and cultural memory. Her first book, titled Hunters, Heroes, Kings, investigates the ways that the ancient kingdom of Macedonia drew from various cultural traditions in the visual expression of its self-identity.                News       Professor Franks was awarded a 2015 National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece where she will conduct research on her upcoming book project, The Space of the Symposium: Mosaics and Movement in the Greek Andron .   Professor Franks convened the Gallatin Global Faculty Symposium &quot;The Material Archive,&quot; in Florence, Italy March 19-21, 2015, at NYU Florence.   Professor Franks was a guest lecturer and leader of a 2013 field trip to Greece through the Archaeological Field School at Heraclea Sintica, a school which she also co-directs.
