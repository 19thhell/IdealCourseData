Thus, a properly designed liquid-nanoporous composite materials may simultaneously accomplish multiple functions, including energy absorption, capture, actuation, and energy harvesting, all with high efficiency and energy densities that may be several orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional materials/systems. These attractive functionalities are underpinned by the science of liquid-solid interactions, where solid mechanics and fluid mechanics meet at the nanoscale. In a confined nanoenvironment, the configurations of liquid molecules and ions are often different from the bulk phase, and their unique interaction behaviors with the solid wall can lead to novel energy conversion mechanisms. The novel developed liquid-nanoporous smart composite materials and the unique characteristics of liquid-solid interaction behaviors at the nanoscale may offer unprecedented opportunities for developing next-generation multifunctional smart systems with self-regulating, self-protective, self-powered, and self-actuated capabilities.

The U.S. Navy has commissioned new research at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University (NYU-Poly) that will aid engineers in designing safer and higher-performing ships, aircrafts and land vehicles. The findings could potentially lead to an improved understanding of blast injuries sustained by soldiers, as well as to increased use of composites in skyscrapers and other construction projects, according to the lead investigators, Drs. Nikhil Gupta and Maurizio Porfiri of NYU-Poly\u2019s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department .   NYU-Poly faculty and students will conduct the U.S. Navy Research Development Test &amp; Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) project called Shock and Vibration Modeling of Marine Composites. The $2 million project will allow NYU-Poly team to investigate and develop new composite materials, analytical tools and processing methods that can be used on naval vessels.   The use of composite materials has been rapidly increasing and now exceeds 8 million tons per year, a large part of which is used in civilian and military aircrafts. Recent breakthroughs in composites allow scientists to create lightweight, durable materials with greater capacity to mitigate blast and vibration effects, which is crucial to building safer ships and aircraft used by the U.S. Navy. The NYU-Poly team will develop advanced composite materials that will increase naval vessels\u2019 damage tolerance and reduce their structural weight, a major goal of the U.S. Navy that could save billions of taxpayer dollars. Prior research into how composites react to blast waves has largely been forensic; according to Drs. Gupta and Porfiri. The new project will develop a comprehensive facility for shock and vibration testing of materials along with scientific procedures and protocols for assessing blast and vibration effects on composites.   U.S. Representative Edolphus \u201cEd\u201d Towns (NY-10) secured the research funding as part of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2010 that was signed into law by President Barack Obama.   \u201cChairman Towns' support for this research comes as the U.S. Navy is transitioning to a greater reliance on advanced composite materials for its ships, submarines and aircraft,\u201d said NYU-Poly President Jerry Hultin. \u201cThis funding will allow our faculty and students to continue to support the Navy's future research and development requirements. We are very grateful for Chairman Towns' continuing support of NYU-Poly.\u201d       About Polytechnic Institute of New York University   Polytechnic Institute of New York University (formerly Polytechnic University), an affiliate of New York University, is New York\u2019s most comprehensive school of engineering, applied sciences, technology and research, and is rooted in Polytechnic\u2019s 156-year tradition of invention, innovation and entrepreneurship \u2013 i 2 e.   The institution, founded in 1854, is one of the nation\u2019s oldest private engineering schools. In addition to its main campus at MetroTech Center in downtown Brooklyn, it offers programs at sites throughout the region and around the globe. NYU-Poly has centers in Long Island, Manhattan and Westchester County; globally, it has programs in Israel, China and will be an integral part of NYU's campus in Abu Dhabi opening in autumn 2010.
