Wellness Walk-in Visit   Students can choose a Wellness walk-in visit (no appointment necessary) to meet briefly with a counselor in person to speak about their issues. These counselors will work with you to develop the most appropriate treatment plan. This can include either a referral to NYU counseling or an external referral to the community. There is no cost for a Wellness walk-in visit.   Walk-in Medication Visit   Students can meet with a psychiatric prescriber during Wellness medication walk-in hours to speak about short-term medication refills, medication side effects, and potential medication options to address simple, specific problems such as airplane flight anxiety, panic attacks, or insomnia.     Be aware that prescribers do not provide refills be ADHD/stimulant medications (i.e. Ritalin, Adderall, Concerta) in the walk-in clinic.
