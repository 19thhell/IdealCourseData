Students from across the world have come to study at Tisch Asia, producing work that has been screened and received awards at some of the world\u2019s most prestigious film festivals, including Berlin, Cannes and Toronto.   Despite its significant creative success, the Tisch Asia campus failed to become financially sustainable. In 2012, the decision was made to close the campus in summer 2015, thereby allowing all current students to obtain their degrees with a full complement of faculty.
