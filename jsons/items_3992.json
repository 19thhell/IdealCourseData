The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood.

For both, it is the formative event of their history. In recent decades, Israel's \"New Historians,\" alongside other researchers, have contributed to changes in the way historians, and even the Israeli public, see their past. We attempt to provide students with basic knowledge and analytical tools to understand what \"really happened,\" beyond narratives and memories.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.

Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

The Jewish Community in Palestine Under Ottoman and British Rule    HBRJD-UA  188 4 points.    The growth of Jewish national aspirations in Europe from the 1880s led to an influx of Jews who wished to settle the land as farmers and to pursue Jewish economic autonomy within the Ottoman world. The occupation of Palestine by British forces and the British support for a Jewish National Home (Balfour Declaration) transformed Jewish expectations. Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood. The  War of 1948    HBRJD-UA  189 Offered  every three years. 4 points.    The first Arab-Israeli war of 1948 still provokes multidimensional debates, in both academic and public circles.

For both, it is the formative event of their history.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

In addition to discussion of secondary readings, classes will focus on the close reading of seminal primary sources in English translation. Israeli Politics in Comparative Perspective HBRJD-UA 711 Offered every two years. 4 points. One of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance. The objective of this class (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. This course will attempt to address the growing interest in comparative analysis of middle-eastern politics, with a focus on the State of Israel.

This  question has been at the core of the discourse about women and peace  ever since its inception in the 19th-century European peace  movements. This course traces the history of this debate, placing it  within the general theoretical discussion over essentialism versus  social and cultural constructivism (or, more commonly, \"nature\"  versus \"nurture\").

Over  the past few decades, many readers have come to a fuller appreciation of the  emotional and imaginative power of the Bible's narratives, which still speak  with remarkable clarity to our own sensibilities, leading one critic to  characterize the Bible as a \"full-fledged kindred spirit\" of modernism.

Increasing waves of immigration began to change the demographic character of Palestine, and the Zionist movement now dominated Jewish life there. We examine the growth of the Jewish community, as well as cooperation and conflict with the Palestinian Arab population; the growth of Arab and Palestinian nationalism and the Arab response to both British rule and the growth of Jewish society; and the parallel development of Jewish demands for separatism and statehood.

Israeli  Politics in Comparative Perspective    HBRJD-UA  711 Offered  every two years. 4 points.    One  of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's  uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and  in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception  of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by  the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the  Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance.  Objective (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to  critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to  which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics  in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli  case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution.

One of the most characteristic themes in Israeli politics is that of Israel's uniqueness, in its security needs, in its cultural and political identity, and in its relationship to the international community. This widespread perception of separateness readily contributes to and is at least partially constituted by the state's history of strategic insecurity and political isolation in the Middle East as well as its characteristic form of democratic governance. The objective of this class (and a central methodological concern of political science) is to critically examine the assumption of Israel as a \"case apart\" and to degree to which Israel's \"unique\" characteristics may be understood as \"normal\" politics in the world at large. In doing so, we seek both to better understand the Israeli case and to explore diverse paths to conflict resolution. This course will attempt to address the growing interest in comparative analysis of middle-eastern politics, with a focus on the State of Israel. Israeli Territorial Politics: Between Security &amp; Identity HBRJD-UA 712 Prerequisite: general knowledge of contemporary Israeli/Middle Eastern politics. Offered every two years. 4 points. This course will explore the evolution of and conflict between different concepts of borders in Israeli domestic discourse and their respective impact on Israel's territorial policies and international boundaries. After considering the role of security and identity in shaping broad domestic understandings of territory in Israel, we will examine how these concepts have uniquely influenced Israeli compromise or lack thereof in the Sinai Peninsula, Southern Lebanon, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and the West Bank. To accomplish this goal, this course will incorporate a range of scholarly historical and political readings on Israel as well as films and regular student-led discussions on relevant current events. Advanced Readings in Modern Hebrew Literature HBRJD-UA 782 In  Hebrew. Offered every other year. Feldman. 4 points.   In-depth study of  selected masterpieces by 20th-century Hebrew writers. Appreciation of  artistic achievements against the sociohistorical background and  general cultural currents of the period. Selections include fiction,  poetry, and literary criticism by and about several of the following  writers: Agnon, Brenner, Gnessin, Yizhar, Alterman, Bialik, and  Greenberg. The Gender of Peace and  War   HBRJD-UA 784 Offered  every third year. Feldman. 4 points.   Is there a \"natural\"  fit between the sexes and the pacifist or military impulse? This  question has been at the core of the discourse about women and peace  ever since its inception in the 19th-century European peace  movements. This course traces the history of this debate, placing it  within the general theoretical discussion over essentialism versus  social and cultural constructivism (or, more commonly, \"nature\"  versus \"nurture\"). Readings include fiction, poetry, and essays  by activists and theorists alike, from Europe, America, and the  Middle East.    Independent Study   HBRJD-UA 997, 998 Open  to honors and nonhonors students. Prerequisite: permission of the  instructor. Offered every semester. 1 to 6 points.

Franklin D. Roosevelt to administer intergovernmental efforts to resettle refugees from Nazi Germany and to prepare for the resettlement of future German emigrants, thus originating planned resettlement of refugees. The IGCR was directed from 1939 by Sir Herbert Emerson, who also served as the League of Nations high commissioner, and was financed by member contributions. Its work was expanded in 1943 to cover all European refugees. The IGCR was terminated in 1947 when its activities were taken over by the International Refugee Organization, a special agency of the United Nations.

Beginning operations on July 1, 1947, the IRO took over the work of its principal predecessor organization, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. Among the services supplied by the IRO were the care and maintenance of refugees in camps, vocational training, orientation for resettlement, and an extensive tracing service to find lost relatives. It also assumed the responsibilities for the legal protection and resettlement of refugees previously carried out by the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees. It was succeeded by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
