By George David Smith , Richard     Sylla , and Robert E. Wright             For most of its existence,      humanity neither enjoyed nor understood society&rsquo;s capacity      for creating wealth and economic growth. Prior to the 18th      century, incomes generally hovered near the subsistence level.      To paraphrase the 17th-century English philosopher Thomas      Hobbes, human life was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and      short. In the late 18th century, the English economist Thomas      Robert Malthus warned that the mass of humanity was doomed      to a life at the margins of starvation, as surges of population      growth would inevitably outstrip the finite sources of food      supply. Things began to change in the 17th and      18th centuries, when people in Holland and Britain began      to produce a little more each year. As the gains added up      over time, modern economic growth had arrived. We define      economic growth as increases in aggregate real income per      person, (that is, income adjusted for inflation). For our      purposes, economic growth starts with the Industrial Revolution,      which began in the British Isles and spread from northwestern      Europe to new areas &ndash; North      America, parts of central and southern Europe, Scandinavia,      and, late in the 19th century, to the frontier &ldquo;European&rdquo; societies      of Australia and New Zealand, to parts of Eastern Europe and      Imperial Russia, and finally, to Japan, the only non-western      society to develop before the mid-20th century. In the late      20th century, the diffusion of industrialization spread rapidly      to the &ldquo;dragons&rdquo; of the Pacific Rim: Taiwan, Hong      Kong, South Korea, and Singapore, and then to the former communist      countries of Eastern Europe.       Today, several important      areas, including China, India, and Eastern Europe, seem poised      to experience sustained economic growth as well. And yet      most of the world&rsquo;s      population remains poor, earning less than the equivalent      of $2 per person per day. Vast areas, including much of Africa,      Latin America, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Micronesia,      remain mired in grinding poverty, as the gap between the      richest and poorest societies continues to increase.       What accounts for such      differences? Many analysts focus on issues like culture,      natural resources, climate, and political systems to explain      the vast differences in economic experiences. But we believe      the answer lies in the intensely historical origins of economic      growth. History shows that over time, healthy, sustainable      economies possess four dynamic, human-made factors: (1) political      systems geared to enabling economic growth, (2) an effective      financial system, (3) vibrant entrepreneurship, and (4) sophisticated      managerial capabilities. In our model, each of these critical      factors is represented as a corner of &ldquo;the      growth diamond.&rdquo; As the illustration suggests, each of      the factors interacts with the others dynamically (and over      time). Proceeding counterclockwise from political systems to      managerial capabilities, each of the facets of the diamond     depends on the robustness of the preceding factors.             Growth Diamond                  An effective political system enables economic growth, first      and foremost, by establishing a government that can unify      an economically relevant territory, establish order, and      protect the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens      through an impartial rule of law. A government must be able      to provide defense, address market failures, and ensure broad-based      access to education. Finally governments, over time, have      to address social and wealth inequalities so that they do      not undermine the social consensus and political stability     required to sustain broad-based economic growth.                   &quot;History shows       that over time, healthy, sustainable economies possess       four dynamic, human-made factors: (1) political systems       geared to enabling economic growth, (2) an effective       financial system, (3) vibrant entrepreneurship, and (4)      sophisticated managerial capabilities.&quot;                   On top of the political      system, a developing society must create a financial system      capable of transferring funds where they are in surplus to      projects where funds are needed. The institutional components      of a modern financial system include banks, capital markets,      and corporations &ndash; legal       entities that can borrow and issue ownership shares while       limiting the liabilities of their owners. Through insurance,       diversification, and hedging strategies, corporations also       substantially reduce the risks of entrepreneurial investment       while organizing production and distribution systems on      a large scale.             As enabling governments and financial systems grow strong,      they enhance the prospects for entrepreneurial activity. And      as the economic historian Joseph Schumpeter observed, entrepreneurship      enhances growth by introducing new products or services, opening      new markets, and creating new combinations of land, labor,      and capital. If government does not legitimize economic innovation      and provide a legal foundation for securing property rights      and reducing risks, entrepreneurs cannot thrive. Likewise,      if financial systems are inefficient, the costs of investment      in new projects can be prohibitive.             Finally, as new enterprises grow, they      rely on more sophisticated methods of coordination and control.      Sophisticated management (the coordination of complex organizations)      is predicated on robust education and is essential to any      society&rsquo;s ability      to realize economies of scale and economies of scope, both      of which help bring down costs. Management also enables enterprises      to plan for the future, to adjust to changing market conditions,      and to invest in new, large projects.             The growth diamond can be applied to every society on earth.      The poorest almost never established enabling political systems,      if only because their governments abused, suppressed, or robbed      their citizens. Poor, but not destitute, societies never established      financial systems or created conditions for entrepreneurship      to flourish, often because their governments restricted economic      liberty or failed to secure property rights adequately. Many      societies that were able to achieve middling income may have      achieved some measure of progress in all corners of the diamond     temporarily but were not able to sustain their gains.                             Early Examples            The Netherlands, the first nation       in modern history to develop the four elements of the growth       diamond, was also the first to experience sustained economic       growth. By the 17th century the Netherlands was a thriving       commercial society populated with what later generations       would call a broad-based bourgeoisie, or middle class.       The Dutch then lacked the technologies that would power       the Industrial Revolution from the late 18th century onward.       But the people of the Netherlands were relatively free       to pursue their economic self-interests under the protection      of a government that saw itself not as the country&rsquo;s      owner, but rather as the people&rsquo;s employee. The citizens      (note the change from &ldquo;subjects&rdquo;) of the Netherlands      willingly paid the world&rsquo;s highest per-capita taxes because      they could see that tax revenues were spent on public goods,      such as defense and the country&rsquo;s extensive network of      windmill-driven water pumps and dikes, and not on lavish parties      and castles.       The Dutch also managed       to create a representative form of government that did       not descend easily into tyranny. While certainly not perfect,       the government of the Netherlands provided the kind of       political foundation on which financial systems, entrepreneurship,       and management could anchor. The Dutch formed what historians       recognize as the first modern financial system &ndash; an       interconnected network composed of private banks and insurance       companies, a proto central bank, and securities markets       for public debt instruments, foreign exchange, commercial       paper, and corporate equities. Entrepreneurs blossomed,       finding it relatively easy and cheap to obtain financing       for an impressive array of business projects &ndash; from       domestic canals to shipbuilding to tulip horticulture.       As some of those businesses grew and matured, they became       too big and complex for the original entrepreneurs to handle,       so a class of specialized administrators developed to run       the larger business organizations.       Great Britain became the next nation       to develop a robust growth diamond. The British would lead       the world into the Industrial Revolution &ndash; the era of machine-driven, factory-based      mass production. Again, the formation of a non-predatory government      that looked unlikely to slide into tyranny was a prerequisite.      It came in the wake of 1688, when the British Parliament replaced      the royalist Stuart monarchy with a Dutch prince who would      be checked by the will of Parliament and bound by laws as interpreted      by an independent judiciary &ndash; the first modern constitutional      monarchy.       The British shrewdly borrowed best       practices from more economically advanced societies. Soon       after the Glorious Revolution, Dutch-style financial institutions       and markets arose in Britain. Not long after, British entrepreneurs       began a vast array of new enterprises that led directly       to revolutions in agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing.       People with highly developed management skills emerged,       making new strides in efficiency. Based on superior institutions       in public finance, new mass production industries, and       organizational capabilities, Britain transformed from a       peripheral island racked by political instability into       the planet&rsquo;s most potent economic and military force.       In the 18th century,       Britain remained highly mercantilist, enacting tariffs       and other policies that it thought would enrich the home       islands at the expense of its colonies and enemies. But       in the 19th century, political economists such as David       Ricardo and John Stuart Mill elaborated on Adam Smith&rsquo;s      critique of protectionism, which helped Britain to enact pro-growth      policies, including free trade and anti-slavery legislation      by the mid-19th century. The British continued to extend their      empire until it was said that the sun never set upon it.             A Colony Rises             Britain&rsquo;s relatively prosperous North American colonies,      chafing under imperial restrictions on their economies, would      eventually outstrip Britain as the world&rsquo;s leading economy      after establishing their own growth diamond. Here, again, government      took the lead. Suffused with myriad checks and balances &ndash; three      branches of government, property protections, political and      economic liberties, and protections for minority rights &ndash; the      US constitution formed the core of an enabling political system.      Soon after its ratification, the rest of the country&rsquo;s     growth diamond crystallized.                   &quot;A       great lesson that economic history teaches us is that       when it comes to developing a healthy private sector,       the public sector serves as the crucial foundation, and       financial systems matter &ndash; both in fostering entrepreneurship       and supporting the efficient managerial systems that       any society needs to sustain growth over the long term.&quot;                   Just a few years after the      new government took effect, Americans enjoyed a financial      system that included a monetary unit (the US dollar), a central      bank (the Bank of the United States), and a growing number      of private commercial banks and insurers. As in the Netherlands      and Britain, the financial system unleashed the forces of &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo; by       linking investors to entrepreneurs with good business ideas.       Canals and turnpikes appeared, connecting the frontier      to the major seaports, which encouraged American farmers      to look for ways to grow more wheat and raise more livestock       so that they could enjoy more manufactured goods. Later,       railroad and telegraph systems emerged and, in just a few       decades, sprawled across the continent in a dense network.             The sheer size of the United States, along with its distance      from potential enemies, conferred enormous advantages for its      economic development. The enormous size of the American market      by the late 19th century also enabled firms to grow to enormous      scale, as capital-intensive industries and retail businesses      in particular drove down costs and prices while driving up      demand, resulting in the creation of ever more businesses,      small and large, local and national.            Railroad managers helped      develop the tools of modern management &ndash; concepts      like cost accounting, managerial accountability, fixed versus      variable costs, and corporate structure. Those tools, in turn,      made possible the great industrial corporations of the late      19th and early 20th centuries. To some degree, the large corporation &ndash; embodied      in companies like Standard Oil, General Motors, and DuPont,      replaced the &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo; of the laissez-faire      market with the &ldquo;visible hand&rdquo; of coordinated management.             Looking Back            By World War I, the rich societies that      had successfully built growth diamonds had evolved further      into open access economies &ndash; ones      that provided reasonably widespread economic opportunity      and encouraged competition. Open access economies provided      for social mobility based relatively more on merit rather      than birthright. They sought to educate everyone and to reduce      discrimination. They also kept the costs of entry into and      exit out of markets low. At any given time, small-, medium-,      and large-sized companies tended to co-exist, each challenging      the others to greater efficiency and quality.       Today, economists, politicians, and      development professionals continue to seek ideas for crafting      policies that will enable long-suffering poor countries to      join the developed world. As they do so, they would be well-advised      to keep the growth diamond in mind. Of course, it does not      explain everything. Such factors as geography, climate, war,      demographics, disease, culture, and changing technological      and competitive environments, to name a few, matter greatly.      Yet a great lesson that economic history teaches us is that      when it comes to developing a healthy private sector, the      public sector serves as the crucial foundation, and financial      systems matter &ndash; both in fostering entrepreneurship      and supporting the efficient managerial systems that any society      needs to sustain growth over the long term.       Governments are vital      for economic growth, but they can also keep societies in      poverty. Once the government is right &ndash; not      predatory, and not overly prone to caving in to special interests &ndash; the      other factors of the economic growth diamond can turn ideas      into marketable goods. Many new business projects will fail,      but the costs will be small and will fall on those willing      to bear them &ndash; entrepreneurs and their investors. Most      important, a few of the ideas will succeed, enriching the lives      of both producers and consumers. The market economy in that      sense works like a giant supercomputer, but one that computes      correctly only when the government ensures that conditions      are favorable and supportive of financial, entrepreneurial,      and managerial enterprise.

Early Examples            The Netherlands, the first nation       in modern history to develop the four elements of the growth       diamond, was also the first to experience sustained economic       growth. By the 17th century the Netherlands was a thriving       commercial society populated with what later generations       would call a broad-based bourgeoisie, or middle class.       The Dutch then lacked the technologies that would power       the Industrial Revolution from the late 18th century onward.       But the people of the Netherlands were relatively free       to pursue their economic self-interests under the protection      of a government that saw itself not as the country&rsquo;s      owner, but rather as the people&rsquo;s employee. The citizens      (note the change from &ldquo;subjects&rdquo;) of the Netherlands      willingly paid the world&rsquo;s highest per-capita taxes because      they could see that tax revenues were spent on public goods,      such as defense and the country&rsquo;s extensive network of      windmill-driven water pumps and dikes, and not on lavish parties      and castles.       The Dutch also managed       to create a representative form of government that did       not descend easily into tyranny. While certainly not perfect,       the government of the Netherlands provided the kind of       political foundation on which financial systems, entrepreneurship,       and management could anchor. The Dutch formed what historians       recognize as the first modern financial system &ndash; an       interconnected network composed of private banks and insurance       companies, a proto central bank, and securities markets       for public debt instruments, foreign exchange, commercial       paper, and corporate equities. Entrepreneurs blossomed,       finding it relatively easy and cheap to obtain financing       for an impressive array of business projects &ndash; from       domestic canals to shipbuilding to tulip horticulture.       As some of those businesses grew and matured, they became       too big and complex for the original entrepreneurs to handle,       so a class of specialized administrators developed to run       the larger business organizations.       Great Britain became the next nation       to develop a robust growth diamond. The British would lead       the world into the Industrial Revolution &ndash; the era of machine-driven, factory-based      mass production. Again, the formation of a non-predatory government      that looked unlikely to slide into tyranny was a prerequisite.      It came in the wake of 1688, when the British Parliament replaced      the royalist Stuart monarchy with a Dutch prince who would      be checked by the will of Parliament and bound by laws as interpreted      by an independent judiciary &ndash; the first modern constitutional      monarchy.       The British shrewdly borrowed best       practices from more economically advanced societies. Soon       after the Glorious Revolution, Dutch-style financial institutions       and markets arose in Britain. Not long after, British entrepreneurs       began a vast array of new enterprises that led directly       to revolutions in agriculture, transportation, and manufacturing.       People with highly developed management skills emerged,       making new strides in efficiency. Based on superior institutions       in public finance, new mass production industries, and       organizational capabilities, Britain transformed from a       peripheral island racked by political instability into       the planet&rsquo;s most potent economic and military force.       In the 18th century,       Britain remained highly mercantilist, enacting tariffs       and other policies that it thought would enrich the home       islands at the expense of its colonies and enemies. But       in the 19th century, political economists such as David       Ricardo and John Stuart Mill elaborated on Adam Smith&rsquo;s      critique of protectionism, which helped Britain to enact pro-growth      policies, including free trade and anti-slavery legislation      by the mid-19th century. The British continued to extend their      empire until it was said that the sun never set upon it.             A Colony Rises             Britain&rsquo;s relatively prosperous North American colonies,      chafing under imperial restrictions on their economies, would      eventually outstrip Britain as the world&rsquo;s leading economy      after establishing their own growth diamond. Here, again, government      took the lead. Suffused with myriad checks and balances &ndash; three      branches of government, property protections, political and      economic liberties, and protections for minority rights &ndash; the      US constitution formed the core of an enabling political system.      Soon after its ratification, the rest of the country&rsquo;s     growth diamond crystallized.                   &quot;A       great lesson that economic history teaches us is that       when it comes to developing a healthy private sector,       the public sector serves as the crucial foundation, and       financial systems matter &ndash; both in fostering entrepreneurship       and supporting the efficient managerial systems that       any society needs to sustain growth over the long term.&quot;                   Just a few years after the      new government took effect, Americans enjoyed a financial      system that included a monetary unit (the US dollar), a central      bank (the Bank of the United States), and a growing number      of private commercial banks and insurers. As in the Netherlands      and Britain, the financial system unleashed the forces of &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo; by       linking investors to entrepreneurs with good business ideas.       Canals and turnpikes appeared, connecting the frontier      to the major seaports, which encouraged American farmers      to look for ways to grow more wheat and raise more livestock       so that they could enjoy more manufactured goods. Later,       railroad and telegraph systems emerged and, in just a few       decades, sprawled across the continent in a dense network.             The sheer size of the United States, along with its distance      from potential enemies, conferred enormous advantages for its      economic development. The enormous size of the American market      by the late 19th century also enabled firms to grow to enormous      scale, as capital-intensive industries and retail businesses      in particular drove down costs and prices while driving up      demand, resulting in the creation of ever more businesses,      small and large, local and national.            Railroad managers helped      develop the tools of modern management &ndash; concepts      like cost accounting, managerial accountability, fixed versus      variable costs, and corporate structure. Those tools, in turn,      made possible the great industrial corporations of the late      19th and early 20th centuries. To some degree, the large corporation &ndash; embodied      in companies like Standard Oil, General Motors, and DuPont,      replaced the &ldquo;invisible hand&rdquo; of the laissez-faire      market with the &ldquo;visible hand&rdquo; of coordinated management.             Looking Back            By World War I, the rich societies that      had successfully built growth diamonds had evolved further      into open access economies &ndash; ones      that provided reasonably widespread economic opportunity      and encouraged competition. Open access economies provided      for social mobility based relatively more on merit rather      than birthright. They sought to educate everyone and to reduce      discrimination. They also kept the costs of entry into and      exit out of markets low. At any given time, small-, medium-,      and large-sized companies tended to co-exist, each challenging      the others to greater efficiency and quality.       Today, economists, politicians, and      development professionals continue to seek ideas for crafting      policies that will enable long-suffering poor countries to      join the developed world. As they do so, they would be well-advised      to keep the growth diamond in mind. Of course, it does not      explain everything. Such factors as geography, climate, war,      demographics, disease, culture, and changing technological      and competitive environments, to name a few, matter greatly.      Yet a great lesson that economic history teaches us is that      when it comes to developing a healthy private sector, the      public sector serves as the crucial foundation, and financial      systems matter &ndash; both in fostering entrepreneurship      and supporting the efficient managerial systems that any society      needs to sustain growth over the long term.       Governments are vital      for economic growth, but they can also keep societies in      poverty. Once the government is right &ndash; not      predatory, and not overly prone to caving in to special interests &ndash; the      other factors of the economic growth diamond can turn ideas      into marketable goods. Many new business projects will fail,      but the costs will be small and will fall on those willing      to bear them &ndash; entrepreneurs and their investors. Most      important, a few of the ideas will succeed, enriching the lives      of both producers and consumers. The market economy in that      sense works like a giant supercomputer, but one that computes      correctly only when the government ensures that conditions      are favorable and supportive of financial, entrepreneurial,      and managerial enterprise.

What influences how higher status people respond to lower status others? Effects of procedural fairness, outcome favorability, and concerns about status. Organizational Science.    Abstract : How do individuals with higher status react to their encounters with lower-status counterparts? Four studies explore this issue, focusing on higher-status parties' concerns with the outcome favorability and procedural fairness of those encounters. Across a wide range of contexts and bases of status, Study 1 found an interaction effect in which outcome favorability had a stronger relationship with higher-status parties' reactions when procedural fairness was high rather than low, in sharp contrast to previous findings in the justice literature. Studies 2, 3, and 4 explored the mechanism underlying this novel finding, testing the proposal that this interaction pattern is rooted in higher-status individuals' use of outcome and procedure information to determine whether their counterpart is validating - or challenging - their relatively higher status position. They conduct this test by examining the moderating influence of dispositional factors that vary the extent to which individuals are interested in social information from their lower-status counterpart regarding their relative status position. In particular, they test the prediction that the interaction will be accentuated among individuals who are (1) low in self-esteem, (2) high in need to belong, (3) low in power distance orientation, and (4) high in general concern about status. Results confirm these predictions. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings for social exchanges at work, organizational justice, and status are discussed.     Blader, S.

Neale (Series Eds.) &amp; E. Mullen (Vol. Ed.), Research on managing groups and teams: Fairness &amp; Groups (pp. 29-62). Bingley, UK: Emerald Publishing.    Abstract : This chapter presents a social emotions-based analysis of justice dynamics, emphasizing the important influence of social emotions (e.g., envy, empathy, schadenfreude, vicarious joy) on justice judgments and reactions. The chapter also identifies a dimension for organizing social emotions, based on the degree of congruence they reflect between self and other. Congruent social emotions align the individual experiencing the emotion and the individual who is the target of their emotion, thus leading individuals to reason about and perceive justice in ways that are aligned with the target. Conversely, incongruent social emotions create misalignment and lead to justice perceptions that are misaligned and oppositional with regard to the target.     Blader, S. L. &amp; Tyler, T. R. (2009). Testing &amp; extending the Group Engagement Model: Linkages between social identity, procedural justice, economic outcomes and extra role behavior . Journal of Applied Psychology .    Abstract : Two field studies test and extend the group engagement model (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2000, 2003) by examining the model with regard to employee extra role behavior. Consistent with the group engagement model\u2019s predictions, results of these studies indicate that the social identities employees form around their work groups and their organizations are strongly related to whether employees engage in extra role behaviors. Moreover, beyond showing that social identity is strongly associated with extra role behavior, the studies also demonstrate that social identity explains the impact of other factors that have previously been linked to extra role behavior. In particular, the findings indicate that social identity mediates the effect of procedural justice judgments and economic outcomes on supervisor ratings of extra role behavior. Overall, these studies provide compelling indication that social identity is an important determinant of behavior within work organizations and provide strong support for the application of the group engagement model in organizational settings.

Organization Science , 19(6): 824-844.    Abstract: The paper advances a relational perspective to studying creativity at the individual level. Building on social network theory and techniques, we examine the role of social networks in shaping individuals' ability to generate a creative outcome. More specifically, we argue that individuals who occupy an intermediate position between the core and the periphery of their social system are in a favorable position to achieve creative results. In addition, the benefits accrued through an individual's intermediate core/periphery position can also be observed at the team level, when the same individual works in a team whose members come from both ends of the core/periphery continuum. We situate the analysis and test our hypotheses within the context of the Hollywood motion picture industry, which we trace over the period 1992\u20132003. The theoretical implications of the results are discussed.     Cattani, G., S. Ferriani, G. Negro, and F. Perretti (2008). The Structure of Consensus: Network Ties, Legitimation and Exit Rates of U.S. Feature Film Producer Organizations . Administrative Science Quarterly , 2008, 53(1): 145-182.    Abstract : Recent research emphasizes that legitimacy depends on consensus among agents (audiences) about the features and activities of organizations (candidates) that become taken-for-granted elements in a social domain. This study examines how consensus is affected by the structure of interaction in the network connecting social audiences to candidate organizations. It analyzes how audience members reach, reinforce, and preserve consensus about candidates' features and behavior, affecting a crucial organizational outcome, survival. The findings show that survival is enhanced by the degree of connectivity and the repeated interactions between audience members and candidate organizations and is reduced by the degree of turnover of audience members. We situate our analysis in the U.S. motion picture industry, where we trace the interorganizational network between feature film producer organizations (candidates) and distributor organizations (the audience) and its influence on producer organizations' exit rates over the period 1912-1970. We find strong support for the claim that the legitimation process has a relational foundation that involves ties between organizational entities and the external others with whom they interact. The results contribute to the dialogue between ecological and network theories of organizations and support the claim that legitimation has a relational foundation involving ties between organizations and audiences.          Dolly Chugh    Kern, M. and Chugh, D. (2009). Bounded ethicality: The perils of loss framing . Psychological Science , Published online Feb 2009.    Abstract : Ethical decision making is vulnerable to the forces of automaticity. People behave differently in the face of a potential loss versus a potential gain, even when the two situations are transparently identical. Across three experiments, decision makers engaged in more unethical behavior if a decision was presented in a loss frame than if the decision was presented in a gain frame. In Experiment 1, participants in the loss-frame condition were more likely to favor gathering \"insider information\" than were participants in the gain-frame condition. In Experiment 2, negotiators in the loss-frame condition lied more than negotiators in the gain-frame condition. In Experiment 3, the tendency to be less ethical in the loss-frame condition occurred under time pressure and was eliminated through the removal of time pressure.

Societal and Managerial Implications of Implicit Social Cognition: Why Milliseconds Matter . Social Justice Research , 17(2), 203-222.    Abstract : This article argues for the vulnerability of managerial work to unintended forms of racial and other bias. Recent insights into \"implicit social cognition\" are summarized, highlighting the prevalence of those mental processes that are relatively unconscious and automatic, and employed in understanding the self and others. Evidence from a response-time measure of implicit bias, the Implicit Association Test, (\"IAT\"; Greenwald, McGhee, and Schwartz, 1998) illustrates this phenomenon. Recent work on the predictive validity of the demonstrates that social cognitive pitfalls threaten a) managers' explicit commitments to egalitarianism and meritocracy and b) managers' performance in their three primary roles of processing information, interacting with others, and making decisions (Mintzberg, 1973). Implicit bias influences managerial behavior in unexpected ways, and this influence is heightened in the messy, pressured, and distracting environments in which managers operate.

Organization Science , 22(3), 587-601.    Full text: Organization Science .   Abstract : Experiences that do not fit squarely into known categories pose a challenge to notions of organizational learning that rely primarily on scientific or experiential approaches. Making sense of, responding to, and learning from such unusual experiences requires reflection and novel action by organizational actors. We argue that narrative development processes make this organizational learning possible. By developing narratives, organizational actors create situated understandings of unusual experiences, negotiate consensual meanings, and engage in coordinated actions. Through the accumulation of narratives about unusual experiences, an organization builds a memory with generative qualities. Specifically, through narratives, actors evoke memories of prior unusual experiences and how they were dealt with, and this generates new options for dealing with emerging unusual experiences. We outline a framework detailing how narrative development processes enable organizational learning from unusual experiences and conclude by summarizing how this approach differs from and yet builds upon scientific and experiential approaches to learning.

Full Text: Strategic Management Journal   Abstract : This study explores the contingencies relating firm experience to product development capabilities, focusing on experience type (breadth v. depth) and timing (prior v. concurrent). Results from empirical tests in the U.S. mutual fund industry offer two primary findings. First, firms increase proficiency at adapting their processes to address new opportunities as they accumulate experience in entering new niches but face initial hurdles broadening their experience base. Second, concurrent learning is capacity constrained, as product quality increases in the number of products introduced simultaneously in one niche, but quality decreases as the firm\u2019s concurrent portfolio of new products broadens. Jointly, these findings highlight that dynamic capabilities are built through prior adaptation experience and that management of a product development portfolio is an important managerial capability.       Eggers, J.P. (2012). Falling Flat: Failed Investments and Technological Evolution. Administrative Science Quarterly, vol. 57 (1), pp. 47-80.    Full Text: Administrative Science Quarterly   Abstract: This study theorizes about the behavioral and knowledge creation implications of betting on the losing technology in a competing technology situation and focuses on three main outcomes. First, in a situation with competing technological options, firms that invest initially in the losing technology will be less successful subsequently in building new knowledge in the winning technology because their experience with failure will lead them to update their expectations of the industry and choose to pursue less risky alternatives. Second, two classic risk-reducing strategies\u2014investing in both technologies or entering after uncertainty is resolved\u2014will not be completely effective. Firms investing in both technologies are likely to suffer the incentive and coordination-driven innovation penalties of generalists, while late entrants will suffer learning disadvantages. Third, the possession of key and relevant complementary assets\u2014upstream and downstream\u2014will positively moderate the observed inertial effect on firms that backed the failed technology and generalists that backed both technologies, as these complementary assets will increase incentives to adapt to the winning technology. I find empirical support for my hypotheses using a novel data set on the evolution of the global flat panel display industry from 1964 to 2003 to investigate the technological competition between plasma and liquid crystal displays. Results show that firms initially pursuing plasma generated less subsequent knowledge in liquid crystal displays, and that firms betting on both technologies were also slow to build knowledge in liquid crystal displays. Meanwhile, firms with upstream and downstream complementary assets were able to moderate, but not overcome, this barrier to knowledge creation. The findings have implications for our study of technological evolution and adaption, for learning from failure and reinforcement learning, and for the relationship between resource partitioning and adaptation.      Eggers, J.P., Grajek, Michal &amp; Kretschmer, Tobias (2012). First Mover Advantages in the Mobile Telecommunications Industry: A Consumer-Centric Perspective. Working paper.     Abstract : We study how two distinct types of pre-entry experience \u2013 core technological experience and market-based complementary experience \u2013 affect post-entry performance in a new industry. We focus on the fit between capabilities generated through pre-entry experience and the preferences of heterogeneous consumer segments. Specifically, we suggest that firms with pre-entry experience in the focal technology will attract more valuable consumers, but as these consumers typically make adoption decisions early the firm must enter early to benefit. Conversely, firms with pre-entry experience in the focal market will attract a larger share of less valuable consumers regardless of entry timing. Our empirical analysis of the global 2G mobile telecommunications industry supports our theory and provides important insights for research on experience and entry dynamics in high-technology industries.

Abstract: The classic tradeoff between exploration and exploitation in organizational learning has attracted vigorous attention by researchers over the last two decades. Despite this attention, however, the question of how firms can better maintain the balance of exploration and exploitation remains unresolved. Drawing on a wide range of research on population and organization structure, we argue that an organization divided into semi-isolated subgroups may help strike this balance. We simulate such an organization, systematically varying the interaction pattern between individuals to explore how the degree of subgroup isolation and inter-group connectivity influences organizational learning. We also test this model with a range of contingency variables highlighted in the management research. We find that moderate levels of cross-group linking lead to the highest equilibrium performance by enabling superior ideas to diffuse across groups without reducing organizational diversity too quickly. This finding is remarkably resilient to a wide range of variance in factors such as problem complexity, environmental dynamism, and personnel turnover.     Fang, Christina &amp; Levinthal, Daniel (Forthcoming). The Near Term Liability of Exploitation: Exploration and Exploitation in Multi-Stage Problems . Organization Science .    Full text : Social Science Research Network .   Abstract : The classic tradeoff between exploration and exploitation reflects the tension between gaining new information about alternatives to improve future returns and using the information currently available to improve present returns (March, 1991). By considering these issues in the context of a multi-stage, as opposed to a repeated, problem environment, we show that exploratory behavior has value quite apart from its role in revising beliefs. We show that even if current beliefs provide an unbiased characterization of the problem environment, maximizing with respect to these beliefs may lead to an inferior expected payoff relative to other mechanisms that make less aggressive use of the organization's beliefs. Search can lead to more robust actions in multi-stage decision problems than maximization, a benefit quite apart from its role in the updating of beliefs.

Full text : Social Science Research Network .   Abstract: Many organizational actions need not have any immediate or direct payoff consequence but set the stage for subsequent actions that bring the organization toward some actual payoff. Learning in such settings poses the challenge of credit assignment (Minsky 1961), that is, how to assign credit for the overall outcome of a sequence of actions to each of the antecedent actions. To explore the process of learning in such contexts, we create a formal model in which the actors develop a mental model of the value of stage-setting actions as a complex problem-solving task is repeated. Partial knowledge, either of particular states in the problem space or inefficient and circuitous routines through the space, is shown to be quite valuable. Because of the interdependence of intelligent action when a sequence of actions must be identified, however, organizational knowledge is relatively fragile. As a consequence, while turnover may stimulate search and have largely benign implications in less interdependent task settings, it is very destructive of the organization's near-term performance when the learning problem requires a complementarity among the actors' knowledge.

Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , 102 (5), 1077-1088.     Full Text : HERE   Abstract: Although the desire for high status is considered universal, prior research suggests individuals often opt for lower status positions. Why would anyone favor a position of apparent disadvantage? In 5 studies, we found that the broad construct of status striving can be broken up into two conceptions: one based on rank, the other on respect. While individuals might universally desire high levels of respect, we find that they vary widely in the extent to which they strive for high-status rank, with many individuals opting for middle- or low-status rank. The status rank that individuals preferred depended on their self-perceived value to the group: when they believed they provided less value, they preferred lower status rank. Mediation and moderation analyses suggest that beliefs about others\u2019 expectations were the primary driver of these effects. Individuals who believed they provided little value to their group inferred that others expected them to occupy a lower status position. Individuals in turn conformed to these perceived expectations, accepting lower status rank in such settings.      Kilduff, Gavin, Elfenbein, Hillary &amp; Straw, Barry (2010). The Psychology of Rivalry: A Relationally Dependent Analysis of Competition . Academy of Management Journal , 53(5), 943-969.      Full Text: HERE   Abstract : We investigate the psychological phenomenon of rivalry and propose that competition is inherently relational, thus extending the literatures on competition between individuals, groups, and firms. Specifically, we argue that competitors\u2019 relationships, determined by their proximity, attributes, and prior competitive interactions, influence the subjective intensity of rivalry between them, which in turn affects their competitive behavior. Initial tests in NCAA basketball support these ideas, indicating that teams\u2019 similarity and interaction histories systematically predict rivalry, and that rivalry may affect team members\u2019 motivation and performance. Implications for the management of employees, as well as for organizations\u2019 competitive strategies, are significant.     Anderson, Cameron &amp; Kilduff, Gavin (2009). Why Do Dominant Personalities Attain Influence in Face-to-Face Groups? The Competence-Signaling Effects of Trait Dominance . Journal of Personality and Social Psychology , 96(2), 491-503.    Full Text: HERE   Abstract : Individuals high in the personality trait dominance consistently attain high levels of influence in groups. Why they do is unclear, however, because most group theories assert that people cannot attain influence simply by behaving assertively and forcefully; rather, they need to possess superior task abilities and leadership skills. In the present research, the authors proposed that individuals high in trait dominance attain influence because they behave in ways that make them appear competent\u2014even when they actually lack competence. Two studies examined task groups using a social relations analysis of peer perceptions (D. A. Kenny &amp; L. LaVoie, 1984). The authors found that individuals higher in trait dominance were rated as more competent by fellow group members, outside peer observers, and research staff members, even after controlling for individuals\u2019 actual abilities. Furthermore, frequency counts of discrete behaviors showed that dominance predicts the enactment of competence-signaling behaviors, which in turn predicts peer ratings of competence. These findings extend researchers\u2019 understanding of trait dominance, hierarchies in groups, and perceptions of competence and abilities.     Anderson, Cameron &amp; Kilduff, Gavin (2009). The Pursuit of Status in Social Groups . Current Directions in Psychological Science , 18(5), 295-298, 2009.    Full Text: HERE   Abstract : Status differences are ubiquitous and highly consequential. Yet with regard to human social groups, basic questions persist about how status differences develop. In particular, little is known about the processes by which individuals pursue status in social groups. That is, how do individuals compete and jockey for status with their peers? The current paper reviews recent research that helps fill this gap in our knowledge. Specifically, studies of a variety of face-to-face groups show that individuals pursue status by enhancing the apparent value they provide to their group. Individuals compete for status not by bullying and intimidating others, as some theorists have proposed, but by behaving in ways that suggest high levels of competence, generosity, and commitment to the group.

Specialization in relational reasoning: The efficiency, accuracy, and neural substrates of social versus non-social inferences. Social Psychological and Personality Science , 1, 318-326.    Abstract : Although deduction can be applied both to associations between non-social objects and to social relationships among people, we hypothesize that social targets elicit specialized cognitive mechanisms that facilitate inferences about social relations. Consistent with this view, in Experiments 1a and 1b we show that participants are more efficient and more accurate at inferring social relations compared with non-social relations. In Experiment 2, we find direct evidence for a specialized neural apparatus recruited specifically for social relational inferences. When making social inferences, fMRI results indicate that the brain regions that play a general role in logical reasoning (e.g., hippocampi, parietal cortices, and DLPFC) are supplemented by regions that specialize in representing people\u2019s mental states (e.g., pSTS/TPJ and mPFC).

Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin , 36, 354-370.    Abstract : In this research, we examine the relationship between power and three characteristics of construal\u2014abstraction, valence, and certainty\u2014in individuals\u2019 verbatim reactions to the events of September 11, 2001 and during the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks. We conceptualize power as a form of social distance and find that position power (but not expert power) was positively associated with the use of language that was more abstract (vs. concrete), positive (vs. negative), and certain (vs. uncertain). These effects persist after controlling for temporal distance, geographic distance, and impression management motivation. Our results support central and corollary predictions of Construal Level Theory (Liberman, Trope, &amp; Stephan, 2007; Trope &amp; Liberman, 2003) in a high-consequence, real-world context, and our method provides a template for future research in this area outside of the laboratory.

Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , 46, 152-158.    Abstract : During a conversation, it is common for a speaker to describe a third-party that the listener does not know. These professed impressions not only shape the listener\u2019s view of the third-party but also affect judgments of the speaker herself. We propose a previously unstudied consequence of professed impressions: judgments of the speaker\u2019s power. In two studies, we find that listeners ascribe more power to speakers who profess impressions focusing on a third-party\u2019s conscientiousness, compared to those focusing on agreeableness. We also replicate previous research showing that speakers saying positive things about third parties are seen as more agreeable than speakers saying negative things. In the second study, we demonstrate that conscientiousness-power effects are mediated by inferences about speakers\u2019 task concerns and positivity-agreeableness effects are mediated by inferences about speakers\u2019 other-enhancing concerns. Finally, we show that judgments of speaker status parallel judgments of agreeableness rather than of power, suggesting that perceivers use different processes to make inferences about status and power. These findings have implications for the literatures on person perception, power, and status.          Frances Milliken    Magee, J., Milliken, F. J. and Laurie, A.R. (2010).

(2011) Voice and silence within organizations: Literature review and directions for future research . Academy of Management Annals , volume 5.    Abstract : Within organizations, employees continually confront situations that put them face-to-face with the decision of whether to speak up (i.e. voice) or remain silent when they have potentially useful information or ideas. In recent years, there has been a rapidly growing body of conceptual and empirical research focused on better understanding the motives underlying voice, individual and situational factors that increase employee voice behavior, and the implications of voice and silence for employees, work groups, and organizations. Yet this literature has notable gaps and unresolved issues, and it is not entirely clear where future scholarship should be directed. This article, therefore, is an attempt to review and integrate the existing literature on employee voice and to also provide some direction for future research.

Abstract : Despite a growing body of research on employee voice \u2013 defined as the discretionary communication of ideas, suggestions, or opinions intended to improve organizational or unit functioning \u2013 the effects of shared or collective-level cognitions have received scant attention. There has also been relatively little research on voice within workgroups. The goal of this study was to address these important gaps by focusing on the effects of group-level beliefs about voice (i.e., group voice climate) on individual voice behavior within workgroups. We conducted a cross-level investigation of voice behavior within 42 groups of engineers from a large chemical company. Consistent with our hypotheses, group voice climate was highly predictive of voice, and explained variance beyond the effects of individual-level identification and satisfaction, and procedural justice climate. Also consistent with predictions, the effect of identification on voice was stronger in groups with favorable voice climates. These findings provide evidence that voice is shaped not just by individual attitudes and perceptions of the work context, as past research has shown, but also by group-level beliefs. The results also highlight the importance of broadening our conceptual models of voice to include shared cognitions, and the importance of conducting additional cross-level research on voice.

Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes , 116 (2), 272-285.     Full Text: Social Science Research Network   Abstract: Incorporating input from others can enhance decision quality, yet often people do not effectively utilize advice. We propose that greater power increases the propensity to discount advice, and that a key mechanism explaining this effect is elevated confidence in one\u2019s judgment. We investigate the relationships across four studies: a field survey where working professionals rated their own power and confidence and were rated by coworkers on their level of advice taking; an advice taking task where power and confidence were self-reported; and two advice taking experiments where power was manipulated. Results consistently showed a negative relationship between power and advice taking, and evidence of mediation through confidence. The fourth study also revealed that higher power participants were less accurate in their final judgments. Power can thus exacerbate the tendency for people to overweight their own initial judgment, such that the most powerful decision makers can also be the least accurate.

Disentangling Role Perceptions: How Perceived Role Breadth, Discretion, Instrumentality and Efficacy Relate to Helping and Taking Charge . Journal of Applied Psychology , 92: 1200-1211.    Abstract : The objective of this study was to empirically disentangle OCB-related role perceptions that have been confounded in past research, investigate their unique relationships with both an affiliative (helping) and a challenging form of OCB (taking charge), and determine their relative importance in explaining these two forms of OCB. We also examine whether role discretion and role breadth independently moderate the procedural justice to OCB relationship. We surveyed 225 engineers in India, and their direct supervisors. Our results showed that three of the four facets of OCB role perception explain unique variance in either helping or taking charge, and that role breadth moderates the relationships between procedural justice and both helping and taking charge. We discuss implications of our findings for OCB theory and research, as well as for managerial practice.          Nathan Pettit    Lount, R. B., Jr., &amp; Pettit, N. C. (conditionally accepted). The social context of trust: The role of status. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes .    Abstract : The current paper examines how status, a universal feature of organizational life, affects people\u2019s initial trust in others. In three experiments \u2013 which employ a range of status manipulations and trust measures \u2013 we consistently observed that the possession of high status led individuals to trust others more. In addition, our results help shed light on why this occurs. Namely, mediation analyses illustrated that having status alters how we perceive others intentions, such that the belief that others have positive intentions toward us (i.e., benevolence) accounted for the relationship between status and trust. These findings contribute both to our knowledge of the contextual features which impact trust and provide insight into the psychological consequences of status.     Pettit, N.

Abstract : Conspicuous consumption and its accompanying debt played a critical role in crippling global financial markets in 2008. Although a confluence of factors contribute to hyper-consumerism, the authors explore the potential role of two psychological forces\u2014the desire to combat self-threats through compensatory consumption and the relatively pain-free experience of consuming on credit\u2014that may have interactively contributed to the pernicious cycle of consumption and debt. Consistent with their predictions, the authors find that self-threat sways individuals to consume with credit over cash (Experiment 1) and the interactive effect of self-threat, product status, and payment method creates a perfect storm, whereby threatened individuals not only seek to consume high-status goods but also, when using credit, do so at higher costs to themselves (Experiment 2). These findings have broad implications for consumer decision making and offer psychologically grounded insights into the regulation of lending policies aimed at promoting consumer health.

Abstract : This paper examines individuals\u2019 reactions to the prospect of gaining or losing status in groups. The results of three experiments provide evidence that individuals attach greater value to status when recalling the risk of status loss than when recalling the potential for status gain (Experiment 1), are willing to pay more to avoid a status loss than to achieve a status gain (Experiment 1), and put forth greater effort when striving to prevent status loss than when striving to gain status (Experiment 2). Finally, individuals who risk losing status allocate more resources toward personal status concerns (and away from group interests and potential monetary gain) than do individuals who have a chance of gaining status (Experiment 3). We discuss the implications of this research both in terms of individuals\u2019 psychological experience of their status, as well as status attainment and maintenance concerns in groups.

Research Policy.     Abstract: Over the past several decades, research in the fields of international business and strategy has devoted increasing attention to outward foreign direct investment (FDI). Despite extensive scrutiny of the firmspecific motivations for, and consequences of, outward FDI; we know relatively little about inward FDI, the impact of inward FDI on host country firms, and especially, how inward FDI affects the innovativeness of those firms. Extant theoretical arguments predict contrasting effects. One line of research highlights the benefits to host country firms. Another line of research highlights the deleterious consequences to host country firms. Utilizing data from 1799 Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990 to 2002, we investigate the relationships between industry-level and firm-level inward FDI and the innovative performance of host country firms. We find that FDI inflows into Spain are negatively associated with the ex post innovation  of local firms. We contrast these findings with those using conventional measures of productivity.

Full text: Download Article   Abstract: An interesting theoretical debate arises when considering firm heterogeneity in learning from exporting. One perspective intimates that technologically lagging firms stand to benefit more from exporting because exposure to technological knowledge in foreign markets allows these firms to close the gap with their more technologically endowed counterparts. A contrasting perspective posits that technologically superior firms benefit more from exporting since these firms are better equipped to translate knowledge acquired in foreign markets into innovation. Using a sample of 1,744 Spanish manufacturing firms from 1990\u20131997, this study empirically investigates how exporting differentially influences the patent output of technologically leading versus technologically lagging firms. We find that exporting is associated with the ex post increase in innovative productivity for both technologically leading and lagging firms. However, subsequent to exporting, technologically leading firms apply for more patents than technologically lagging firms.     X.Martin, R. Salomon &amp; Z. Wu (2010).

Full text: Download Article   Abstract: We hypothesize that several characteristics of a country\u2019s institutional environment encourage firms to agglomerate. To test our hypotheses, we examine the collocation pattern of 931 plant investments made by 266 firms across 29 countries in the global semiconductor industry from 1975 to 2004. The results show that the decision to agglomerate is strongly dependent on a country\u2019s institutional context. Specifically, firms prefer to agglomerate when investing within countries with collectivist cultures, and those characterized by political and economic uncertainty. We assess the robustness of the results across multiple indicators of these institutional conditions.     Salomon, R. &amp; X. Martin (2008). Learning, Knowledge Transfer and Technology Implementation Performance: A Study of Time-to-Build in the Global Semiconductor Industry . Management Science , 54 (7): 1266-1280.    Full text: Download Article   Abstract: Organizational growth and performance hinge upon the effective deployment of productive knowledge in new facilities. However, getting those facilities fully operational can be difficult and time-consuming. Interestingly, we understand little about what determines the performance of that process. In this paper we help fill this gap by analyzing multiple determinants of time-to-build \u2013 i.e., the time it takes a firm to build and ramp up operations at a new manufacturing facility. Theoretically, we develop predictions regarding the effects of competitive, firm, and technology characteristics on time-to-build. Empirically, we test our predictions on a sample of plant construction projects in the memory segment of the global semiconductor industry. We find that competition from rivals with superior technology is associated with shorter time-to-build, at least up to a point. Firm, and industry, experience is associated with shorter time-to-build. International projects, and those that push the technological frontier, take longer. Findings from this study enrich the literatures on corporate growth, international expansion, and technology strategy. We discuss implications for research and practice.

Abstract: A considerable body of research utilizes large alliance databases (e.g., SDC, MERIT-CATI, CORE, RECAP, and BIOSCAN) to study inter-organizational relationships. Understanding the strengths and limitations of these databases is crucial for informing database selection and research design. In this paper I conduct an analysis of five prominent alliance databases. Focusing on technology alliances (those formed for the purposes of joint research or cross-technology transfer), I examine the databases\u2019 consistency of coverage and completeness, and assess whether different databases yield the same patterns in sectoral composition, temporal trends, and geographic patterns in alliance activity. I also replicate three previously-published alliance studies to assess the impact of data limitations on research outcomes. The results suggest that the databases only report a fraction of formally announced alliances, which could have detrimental consequences for some types of research. However, the databases exhibit strong symmetries in patterns of sectoral composition, alliance activity over time, and geographic participation. Furthermore, the replications of previous studies yielded results that were highly similar to those obtained in the original studies. This study thus provides some reassurance that even though the databases only capture a sample of alliance activity, they may yield reliable results for many -- if not all -- research purposes. This information should help researchers make better-informed decisions about their choice of database and research design.     Schilling, M.A. &amp; Esmundo, M. (2009). Technology s-curves in renewable energy alternatives: Analysis and implications for industry and government . Energy Policy .    Abstract : Plotting the performance of a technology against the money or effort invested in it most often yields an s-shaped curve: slow initial improvement, then accelerated improvement, then diminishing improvement. These s-curves can be used to gain insight into the relative payoff of investment in competing technologies, as well as providing some insight into when and why some technologies overtake others in the race for dominance. Analyzing renewable energies from such a technology s-curve perspective reveals some surprising and important implications for both government and industry. Using data on government R&amp;D investment and technological improvement (in the form of cost reductions), we show that both wind energy and geothermal energy are poised to become more economical than fossil fuels within a relatively short time frame. The evidence further suggests that R&amp;D for wind and geothermal technologies has been under-funded by national governments relative to funding for solar technologies, and government funding of fossil fuel technologies might be excessive given the diminishing performance of those technologies.

Abstract : The structure of alliance networks influences their potential for knowledge creation. Dense local clustering provides information transmission capacity in the network by fostering communication and cooperation. Non-redundant connections contract the distance between firms and give the network greater reach by tapping a wider range of knowledge resources. We propose that firms embedded in alliance networks that exhibit both high clustering and high reach (short average path lengths to a wide range of firms) will have greater innovative output than firms in networks that do not exhibit these characteristics. We find support for this proposition in a longitudinal study of the patent performance of 1106 firms in 11 industry-level alliance networks.          Robert Seamans    Seamans, Robert (2012). Fighting City Hall: Entry Deterrence and Technology Deployment in the Cable TV Industry. Management Science, 58(3): 461-475. (Lead Article).    Abstract: This article investigates how private firms respond to potential entry from public firms. The article uses a dataset of over 3000 US cable TV systems to present evidence consistent with entry deterrence. Incumbent cable TV firms upgrade faster when located in markets with a potential municipal entrant. However, the same systems are then slower to offer new products enabled by the upgrade, suggesting upgrades in these markets occur for strategic reasons. Incumbent cable systems also upgrade faster in response to municipal entry threats than to private entry threats. Understanding how private firms respond to potential entry from public firms is especially important in light of recent US government entry into several industries.

Abstract : This paper examines the impact of financial deregulation on entrepreneurship. We assess the impact of credit card deregulation on transitions into self-employment using state level removal of credit card interest rate ceilings following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1978 Marquette decision as a quasi-natural experiment. We find that credit card deregulation increases the probability of entrepreneurial entry, with a particularly strong effect for black entrepreneurs. We demonstrate that these effects are magnified in states with a history of racial discrimination, and link the results to discrimination-based barriers to entry.

The field of management\u2019s devotion to theory: Too much of a good thing? Acad. Management J. 50(6) 1346\u20131352]. In his paper, Hambrick criticizes the practice employed by many journals in the management field that requires that papers submitted for publication make a strong theoretical contribution. I argue that part of the problem is caused by the misunderstanding and misuse of the term \u201ctheory.\u201d To clarify the status of theory, I review three modes of research formulation in the organizational sciences: theories, models, and conceptual frameworks. Language plays an important role in scientific research. I therefore discuss two research languages that are used in research in management that appear to be the farthest apart: mathematics, which is the language of precision; and narratives, which is the language that provides rich data. I provide a discussion of the use of mathematics in theory development and the use of narratives in research development. The two languages and three modes of research formulation are needed for contribution to knowledge, which should be the main goal of research in organization science.

Abstract : Do participants bring their own priors to an experiment? If so, do they share the same priors as the researchers who design the experiment? In this article, we examine the extent to which self-generated priors conform to experimenters\u2019 expectations by explicitly asking participants to indicate their own priors in estimating the probability of a variety of events. We find in Study 1 that despite being instructed to follow a uniform distribution, participants appear to have used their own priors, which deviated from the given instructions. Using subjects\u2019 own priors allows us to account better for their responses rather than merely to test the accuracy of their estimates. Implications for the study of judgment and decision making are discussed.     Dushnitsky, G. &amp; Shapira, Z. (2010). Entrepreneurial Finance Meets Organzational Reality: Comparing Investment Practices and Performance of Corporate and Independent Venture Capitalists Strategy Management , 31: 990-1017.    Abstract : This paper investigates the effect of compensation of corporate personnel on their investment in new technologies. We focus on a specific corporate activity, namely corporate venture capital (CVC), describing minority equity investment by established-firms in entrepreneurial ventures. The setting offers an opportunity to compare corporate investors to investment experts, the independent venture capitalists (IVCs). On average, we observe a performance gap between corporate investors and their independent counterparts. Interestingly, the performance gap is sensitive to CVCs\u2019 compensation scheme: it is the largest when CVC personnel are awarded performance pay. Not only do we study the association between incentives and performance but we also document a direct relationship between incentives and the actions managers undertake. For example, we observe disparity between the number of participants in venture capital syndicates that involve a corporate investor, and those that consist solely of IVCs. The disparity shrinks substantially, however, for a subset of CVCs that compensate their personnel using performance pay. We find a parallel pattern when analyzing the relationship between compensation and another investment practice, staging of investment. To conclude, the paper investigates the three elements of the principal-agent framework, thus providing direct evidence that compensation schemes (incentives) shape investment practices (managerial action), and ultimately investors\u2019 outcome (performance).

Knowing Where You Stand: Physical Isolation, Perceived Respect, and Organizational Identification Among Virtual . Organization Science .    Abstract : This research investigates the relationship between virtual employees\u2019 degree of physical isolation and their perceived respect in the organization. Respect is an identity-based status perception that reflects the extent to which one is included and valued as a member of the organization. We hypothesize that the degree of physical isolation is negatively associated with virtual employees\u2019 perceived respect and that this relationship explains the lower organizational identification among more physically isolated virtual employees. In two field studies using survey methods, we find that perceived respect is negatively associated with the degree of physical isolation, and respect mediates the relationship between physical isolation and organizational identification. These effects hold for shorter- and longer-tenured employees alike. Our research contributes to the virtual work literature by drawing attention to physical isolation and the important but neglected role of status perceptions in shaping virtual employees\u2019 organizational identification. We also contribute to the literature on perceived respect by demonstrating how respect is affected by the physical context of work.     Brockner, J., Wiesenfeld, B.M., &amp; Diekmann, K.A. (2009). Towards a \"Fairer\" Conception of Process Fairness: Why, When and How More may not Always be Better than Less . The Academy of Management Annals , 3(1): 183-216.    Abstract : Process fairness refers to people\u2019s perceptions of how fairly they are treated in the course of interacting with another party. Conceptually distinct from outcome fairness, it subsumes procedural fairness, interpersonal fairness, and the like. As recipients of decisions, we generally want to be treated with more rather than with less process fairness. As agents of decisions, we often would rather plan and implement them with more rather than with less process fairness. Whereas the organizational justice literature generally extols the virtues of high process fairness, recent theory and research suggest that when it comes to process fairness, more is not always better than less. We discuss why, when, and how people\u2019s general tendency to desire higher process fairness over lower process fairness may be attenuated, eliminated, or even reversed. Our analysis is organized by the notion that under some conditions, receiving or acting with high process fairness prevents people from satisfying some of their basic psychological motives, such as their needs to feel good about themselves or to maintain a sense of control. Future research directions also are considered.     Wiesenfeld, B.M., Wurthmann, K.A., &amp; Hambrick, D.C. (2008). The Stigmatization and Devaluation of Elites Associated with Corporate Failures: A Profess Model . Academy of Management Review , 33(1): 231-251.    Abstract : We develop a model to explain the process by which corporate failure leads to professional devaluation of individual elites. We envision that corporate failure evokes a stigmatization process, in which society\u2019s arbiters engage in constituentminded sensemaking to interpret the conditions surrounding the failure, including the characteristics of the individual elite, and arrive at judgments about the person\u2019s blameworthiness. We discuss implications of this research for the study of stigma and stigmatization, as well as \u201csettling-up\u201d in managerial labor markets.
