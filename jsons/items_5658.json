I also participate in the Organ Systems course (teaching a thoracic anatomy lab) and the NBDE Part I Review course. I have experience creating educational materials and have edited an anatomical atlas designed specifically for dental students. I am interested in theories of learning, especially as they relate to adult education. I attempt to employ the Socratic method in learning interactions in both lectures and small group settings. In addition to teaching experience in lectures and lab settings, I have experience in course design and have redesigned the gross anatomy course to allow for small group learning experiences that foster experiential and meaningful learning opportunities.                Marie A Congiusta, DDS   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Clinical Assistant Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member                                     Ronald Craig, DMD, PhD   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology        Periodontology and Implant Dentistry   Academy Title: Member        Personal Statement:  My focus in dental education has been to present those components of the basic biologic sciences which will enable an understanding of dental and oral pathology and provide a scientific foundation for clinical dental practice. The topics I present in the DDS, post graduate, graduate, CDE, and dental hygiene curricula reflect my clinical practice and research interests. These include: extracellular matrix biochemistry, tooth development, enamel, dentin, development of periodontal tissues, eruption, innate and adaptive immune responses to infection and trauma, systemic effects of inflammation, wound healing, pathogenesis of periodontal diseases, periodontal regeneration, and periodontal tissue \u2013 biomaterial interactions. Since clinical practice involves data gathering and analysis (i.e. clinical examination and diagnosis) as well as the design of a patient centered course of action to manage the disease or condition (i.e. treatment plan), I have tried to include in all of my presentations discussions of land mark experiments that have shaped our present view of dental pathology and therapy. I believe the discussion of these critical studies help foster critical thinking skills and the ability to read the clinical scientific literature. This is part of an overarching attempt to help students become life-long learners and critical consumers of science. My interests in the Academy include curriculum development to foster deeper integration of the basic and clinical sciences and exploration of non-traditional means of instruction in dental education.                 Elena P. Cunningham, PhD, MA   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Adjunct Associate Professor   Department: Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology   Academy Title: Member           Personal Statement:  I teach Head and Neck Anatomy, Organ Systems, and am the Course Director for the NBDE Part I Review Course. I developed anatomy workbooks to help students prepare for the Part I Boards and to focus their lab time in that course and in Organ Systems. I enjoy the small-group, student-teacher interactions of an anatomy lab which allow me to facilitate student learning and exploration. I am an anthropologist and my research concerns the skills primates use when travelling between fruit trees. I am interested in learning about the ways in which human and non-human primates learn and applying this information in the classroom.                William Eidtson, EdD, MS   Academy Title: Executive Director                                     Debra M. Ferraiolo, DMD   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Clinical Assistant Professor   Department: Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member                                     Laurie R. Fleisher, DMD   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Clinical Assistant Professor   Department(s): Cariology and Comprehensive Care &amp; Endodontics   Academy Title: Member                                     Winnie Furnari, RDH, MS, FAADH   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Dental Hygiene   Academy Title: Member           Personal Statement:  Because we know that not all learning occurs in the classroom, I encourage and oversee student experiences out in the community and within their professional activities. I see service learning not as an adjunct to the classroom but as integral for developing the health professional.   I am a clinical associate professor in the Dental Hygiene program where I teach in general and orthodontic clinic. I lecture two exciting courses, &quot;Ethics&quot; at the Associate Degree Level and &quot;Forensic Dentistry and Catastrophe Preparedness&quot; at the Bachelor Degree Level. These are topics I am passionate about.   One of my goals is to have more integration of dentists, dental hygienists, and nurses teaching and learning together both in the classroom and in the outside community.   I am involved in several organized associations and publications on national, local, and government levels. I have varied research and writing interests including HIV, diabetes, and Forensic Dentistry. Mentoring my colleagues in teaching and professional advancement is a most meaningful endeavor.              Judith Kreismann, RDH, MA   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Dental Hygiene   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement  As a dental hygiene faculty, I teach a lecture course, coordinate faculty services, manage the pre-clinic program, and direct the Periodontics course. In these roles I am the liaison for faculty and students. My responsibilities include faculty standardization among the pre-clinic and clinical faculty as well as the organization of programs and presentations directed at dental hygiene topics. I have presented and participated in instrument standardization workshops in the DH program and enjoy the process. I have presented posters at national association meetings on various topics. My interests include faculty standardization, promotion, development, and advising. I have worked with part time faculty on projects for submission for degree completion and publication. I have enjoyed participating on several major funded research projects as clinical examiner, and I am interested in advising on research opportunities both in-house and beyond NYUCD.                Mitchell Lipp, DDS   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Orthodontics   Academy Title: Member   Academy Role: Past Chairperson         Personal Statement:  I have been teaching full-time at the College for over twenty years ... and have never loved it more than right now. This is an incredible transformational moment in education. New technologies have liberated learning from the confines of the classroom. A convergence of information from learning theory, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience has deepened our understanding of how people learn. Even the very purpose of education has come into question. &quot;Habits of the mind&quot; ... critical thinking, reasoning, problem solving, self-directed learning, metacognition ... are now highly valued skills (some of these are standards for accreditation!) To me teaching is an experiment. My goal is to improve teaching and learning based on reason and evidence. The experiment continues as new methods of instruction and assessment are evaluated and confounders identified.   My background is varied: a camp counselor and group leader, a 6th grade classroom teacher, a clinical orthodontist, a dental educator, course director, and program director. My interest in education is evident in my activity and student mentorship at the College. In preparation for the next annual ADEA session, I am working (with students and faculty colleagues) on the following projects:     A Framework for Teaching Critical Thinking in Dental Education   Building a Pipeline: Dental Career Program for Underprivileged Middle-School Children   Learning with digital games: The future of dental education?   Can additional assessments improve student achievement in a competency-based course? A Case Report   Anatomy of a Course Evaluation: Guiding Principles to optimize accurate and useful feedback   DIVERSITY: Emergence and evolution in dental education   Ten things every dental educator should know                  Ronald I. Maitland, DMD   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  My background of professional interests has been varied. I have presented over 400 full day and multi-day educational seminars nationally and internationally on subjects that include restorative dentistry, esthetics, prosthodontics, emergency medicine, ethics, jurisprudence, risk management and initial licensure readiness skills. At NYUCD, I lead a weekly section in treatment planning called Morning Rounds, monitor restorative and communication competencies, As an author, I have over 20 publications covering a wide variety of clinically related subjects have appeared in peer reviewed journals. I sit on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry and the Board of Overseers for the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. A main thrust of my service to the profession has been involved in championing professional responsibility of dentists for public protection and safety. Monitoring professional conduct, as a 22 year experience on the New York State Board for Dentistry, has laid a groundwork for a keen interest in ethical sensitivity of students and practitioners.   My teaching thrust is to encourage synthesis and coordination of the basic sciences and didactic knowledge with clinical acumen. This bringing together of thought processes to form an accurate and competent diagnosis can not be understated. Individual clinical experiences during patient care have to be shared among groups of students for a broader exposure to learning opportunities.                Maureen McAndrew, DDS, MSED   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Clinical Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  As Senior Director of Professional Development at NYUCD, I serve as the program director for the Teaching in Dental Education (T.I.D.E.) Fellowship Program and created and direct the Excellence in Clinical Teaching Program and Class ACTS (Advanced Clinical Teaching Scholars) program. I am also the course director for the Practicum in Clinical Teaching for fourth-year dental students with an interest in academia. Additionally, I teach Introduction to Pedagogy to all post-graduate students and also teach restorative dentistry and practice management. I have lectured extensively and consulted on faculty development, pedagogy, faculty hiring and retention, generational issues, domestic violence, and conflict resolution.   My publications concern faculty development, teaching methodologies, on-line programming and domestic violence. I serve on the Editorial Review Board of the Journal of Dental Education and as Chair of the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) Section on Educational Research, Development and Curriculum.                Marjan Moghadam, DDS, MA   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Prosthodontics   Academy Title: Chairperson         Personal Statement:  I teach preclinical and clinical courses for pre-doctoral students as well as in the post-doctoral program. On the clinic floor I teach prosthodontics and I direct literature review courses related to fixed prosthodontics for post-doctoral residents.   My passion and the work I enjoy doing most centers on developing teaching materials for predoctoral students (such as manuals) and am most interested in bridging the gap between simulation care and translation to patient care. In other words, how do we translate what students learn on the manikin in a simulation module to what happens in the dental chair with the patient. I also am very interested in the process of sharing unique clinical findings which I have focused on using online media as well as poster presentations in our Showcase.                Mary Northridge, PhD, MPH   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Assistant Professor   Department: Epidemiology and Health Promotion   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I teach Epidemiology and Critical Thinking for the Dental Student to the D1 class. I am VERY interested in building upon the knowledge I gained this year to better ensure that we create student-centered, responsive learning experiences for every student enrolled. I also mentor summer research and honors students on defined projects, for example, Michele Equinda (D2 honors student) on Scoping Up Dental Education to Address HPV-Related Oropharyngeal Cancer, which she presented at the ADEA conference in March 2013.   My long-term teaching goals are to better integrate oral health with public health histories, theories, methods, and tools, including through educating dental students as part of integrated, community-based service delivery programs. I would love to teach a seminar in Social Determinants of Oral Health and conduct workshops on writing for peer-reviewed publication for students and faculty.   I have been teaching professionally for over 3 decades, and always have more fun when I am paired with a co-instructor with complementary expertise. Students are excited about the different perspectives that are brought to bear on the questions at hand, and enriched through the debate that ensues.                Ivy D. Peltz, DDS, MSED   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care         Personal Statement:  I am a clinical associate professor and Group Practice Director in the department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care. I hold a Masters in Higher Education and I'm currently ABD (all but dissertation) in a PhD program in Higher Education at Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University. My dissertation topic is the transfer of knowledge from theory to application, but I'm interested in anything and everything related to teaching, particularly topics that could result in improved teaching and learning for our community.                Joan A. Phelan, DDS   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Honorary Fellow                                       Rebecca Poling, DDS, MSD   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Clinical Assistant Professor   Department: Orthodontics   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I direct the Predoctoral Invisalign Clinic, give orthodontic consults in all of the General Practice Clinics, and teach some sessions in different courses. I believe learning new information should be fun and exciting.   My role as a teacher is to facilitate student learning so that students will want to learn. In the end, we cannot make anyone learn if he or she is not receptive. So my job is to figure out the essential information for students to know, what is the most accurate information now, and how may I organize it so each student learns it efficiently.   For the past fifteen years I have been involved in electronic learning, from CD-ROM presentations and now online presentations. I currently use online presentations that I develop to teach students how to perform procedures in the Invisalign Clinic. My latest area of interest is to track student &quot;learning&quot; from online presentations by measuring a student\u2019s online viewing time and immediate recall &quot;quiz question&quot; score. This learning data then is compared to clinical performance measures as recorded on an iPad. I call this project &quot;Learning Analytics.&quot; The final objective is to help each student recognize when he has learned or not learned the procedure so that he knows when his clinical outcome is acceptable or not acceptable. Faculty members then are mentors instead of &quot;graders&quot; and students take responsibility for their own learning.   I look forward to sharing these thoughts and interests with other members and faculty and exploring exciting new ways of learning and teaching!                                       Stefanie Russell, DDS, MPH, PhD   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Epidemiology         Personal Statement:  I am a periodontist and an epidemiologist and am currently an Associate Clinical Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion. I maintain a clinical practice that focuses primarily on the periodontal care of medically compromised adults, and I teach at the dental undergraduate (currently as the course director for the D3 &quot;Skills in Assessing the Professional Literature&quot; course) and at the master's level.   I have developed a research program that focuses on the oral health of vulnerable populations, including women, the elderly and low-income and racial-ethnic minority groups. My current primary research interest is the oral health of pregnant women and models of safe and effective dental care delivery for pregnant women.                Miriam Robbins, DDS, MS   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I am a clinical associate professor in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology, and Medicine. My primary didactic and teaching responsibilities center on providing dental care to patients with who are medically complex, physically and/or intellectually challenged. I am the Director of the Special Needs Clinic and the course director of a D3 course titled &quot;Care of the Medically Complex Patient&quot;. I am interested in exploring the ways to facilitate active learning, utilizing new technology to present didactic content to the students and employing the concepts of &quot;the inverted classroom&quot; to help students integrate and apply information in a clinical setting.                Andrew Schenkel, DMD, MS   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I am the newly appointed Associate Director of Community Based Dental Education in the Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care. In addition to organizing local community outreach events, I am responsible for the oversight of students placed in community facilities providing comprehensive dental care as part of a mini residency elective program. I am currently working to expand the program and develop additional sites so that every student can spend a significant amount of time providing dental care for patients in a community setting.     Before assuming this new position I was formerly a Group Practice Director for six years and also served as mentor for a group of 2-4 freshmen each year. I currently serve on the curriculum review committee, the evidence based practice steering committee, and I am chair of the part time faculty appointments and promotions committee. I also serve as an evidence based dentistry champion for the ADA and I have made multiple presentations on the subject at the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) annual meetings. I am passionate about teaching effectively in order to improve patient care and I am eager to work with anyone with similar interests.              Silvia Spivakovsky, DDS   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology &amp; Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I teach both in the clinic and lecture where I seek to implement Evidence Based Practice philosophy as a way to promote active learning. I'm also interested in implementing techniques to promote better integration between both the classroom and the clinic as well as between the basic sciences and the clinic. I am a proponent of case based learning and believe we need more multidisciplinary cases to help with the integration process. I enjoy working in small groups (even if that means having to repeat the same thing several times), learning about new technologies and working collaboratively.                Louis Terracio, PhD   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Vice Dean for Research   Academy Title: Honorary Fellow                                       Analia Veitz-Keenan, DDS   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I teach and direct in the Admissions Clinic of the Oral Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine Department where I'm always looking for new techniques for teaching to make the students' experience the most enjoyable and productive rotation they have with us.   After spending several years learning about the topic, I am now practicing Evidence Based Dentistry, which I teach to students and colleagues at NYUCD, as well as interested national and international audiences. Recently, building on the alliance we started with the Cochrane Oral Health Group (COHG), I have co- authored several systematic review protocols and I have been organizing workshops with COHG.   I have also had the pleasure of being involved in a range of projects such as helping students in their presentations related to Evidence Based Dentistry to assisting my colleagues in scholarly activities such as preparing articles for journals and presentations for ADEA and AADR/IADR.              Anthony Vernillo, DDS, PHD, MBE   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I have taken a sabbatical leave for approximately six months from September 1, 2013 to February 15, 2014 to work on ethics curriculum with a colleague at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), Cape Town. I am keenly interested in bringing more into the ethics curriculum at NYUCD. UWC is in the process of developing a more coherent approach to the teaching and learning of bioethics, and specifically the bioethics of dental research. That initiative at UWC has thus far attempted to address the content and instructional design of the undergraduate and postgraduate curricula to establish tools for delivery to on-site and distance learning students. I look forward to working at UWC with e-Learning, proven text and case-learning formats, face-to-face encounters, and emerging interactive technologies to enhance the learning process and develop assessments for that process.   The sabbatical at UWC should give me better tools for delivery and adding bioethics courses to the curriculum at NYUCD. As Affiliated Faculty to the Center for Bioethics at NYU Washington Square, I have been asked to join a twelve member panel from NYU and develop bioethics curriculum for the master's degree at the postgraduate level. In his thesis on evolution, Darwin argued that nature does not take giant leaps but small steps. In that regard, I will also start with the systemic pathology course that I teach to the undergraduate students at NYUCD. I have been hesitant to add bioethics to this course given the precious little time to teach pathology. But that will change. So, in the not too distant future, I will add lectures on the ethics of heart transplantation and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to the cardiovascular component to the course; and scarcity of resources and distributive justice as it pertains to those on waiting lists in renal dialysis. It will be a small step but a way to gauge students' initial responses.                Johanna Warshaw, PhD   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Research Assistant Professor   Department: Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology   Academy Title: Member             Personal Statement:  I am a biological anthropologist, with interests in primate evolution, development and behaviors as they are recorded in the microstructures of bone and fossil bone. I teach Head and Neck Anatomy lectures and conferences, as well as conferences for the Organ Systems and the NBDE Part I Review Course and lectures as part of the Dental Hygiene curriculum. I manage the Head and Neck Anatomy NYU Classes interface, and maintain and edit online teaching materials for the course, as well as online testing modules. I am also involved in the creation of online learning modules for the NBDE Part I Review Course. I love teaching in conference settings where there is the opportunity to engage in discussions and encourage student driven learning.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy lecture based teaching as well, and am interested in the study of how learners best acquire and retain knowledge, and the ways in which various presentation techniques and aides work to promote student interest and retention.                                          the academy Read More                         membership information Read More                         Showcase Read More                         JADE Read More                                                                    Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}]},

I also participate in the Organ Systems course (teaching a thoracic anatomy lab) and the NBDE Part I Review course. I have experience creating educational materials and have edited an anatomical atlas designed specifically for dental students. I am interested in theories of learning, especially as they relate to adult education. I attempt to employ the Socratic method in learning interactions in both lectures and small group settings. In addition to teaching experience in lectures and lab settings, I have experience in course design and have redesigned the gross anatomy course to allow for small group learning experiences that foster experiential and meaningful learning opportunities.                Marie A Congiusta, DDS   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Clinical Assistant Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member                                     Ronald Craig, DMD, PhD   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology        Periodontology and Implant Dentistry   Academy Title: Member        Personal Statement:  My focus in dental education has been to present those components of the basic biologic sciences which will enable an understanding of dental and oral pathology and provide a scientific foundation for clinical dental practice. The topics I present in the DDS, post graduate, graduate, CDE, and dental hygiene curricula reflect my clinical practice and research interests. These include: extracellular matrix biochemistry, tooth development, enamel, dentin, development of periodontal tissues, eruption, innate and adaptive immune responses to infection and trauma, systemic effects of inflammation, wound healing, pathogenesis of periodontal diseases, periodontal regeneration, and periodontal tissue \u2013 biomaterial interactions. Since clinical practice involves data gathering and analysis (i.e. clinical examination and diagnosis) as well as the design of a patient centered course of action to manage the disease or condition (i.e. treatment plan), I have tried to include in all of my presentations discussions of land mark experiments that have shaped our present view of dental pathology and therapy. I believe the discussion of these critical studies help foster critical thinking skills and the ability to read the clinical scientific literature. This is part of an overarching attempt to help students become life-long learners and critical consumers of science. My interests in the Academy include curriculum development to foster deeper integration of the basic and clinical sciences and exploration of non-traditional means of instruction in dental education.                 Elena P. Cunningham, PhD, MA   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Adjunct Associate Professor   Department: Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology   Academy Title: Member           Personal Statement:  I teach Head and Neck Anatomy, Organ Systems, and am the Course Director for the NBDE Part I Review Course. I developed anatomy workbooks to help students prepare for the Part I Boards and to focus their lab time in that course and in Organ Systems. I enjoy the small-group, student-teacher interactions of an anatomy lab which allow me to facilitate student learning and exploration. I am an anthropologist and my research concerns the skills primates use when travelling between fruit trees. I am interested in learning about the ways in which human and non-human primates learn and applying this information in the classroom.

I see service learning not as an adjunct to the classroom but as integral for developing the health professional.   I am a clinical associate professor in the Dental Hygiene program where I teach in general and orthodontic clinic. I lecture two exciting courses, &quot;Ethics&quot; at the Associate Degree Level and &quot;Forensic Dentistry and Catastrophe Preparedness&quot; at the Bachelor Degree Level. These are topics I am passionate about.   One of my goals is to have more integration of dentists, dental hygienists, and nurses teaching and learning together both in the classroom and in the outside community.   I am involved in several organized associations and publications on national, local, and government levels. I have varied research and writing interests including HIV, diabetes, and Forensic Dentistry. Mentoring my colleagues in teaching and professional advancement is a most meaningful endeavor.              Judith Kreismann, RDH, MA   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Dental Hygiene   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement  As a dental hygiene faculty, I teach a lecture course, coordinate faculty services, manage the pre-clinic program, and direct the Periodontics course. In these roles I am the liaison for faculty and students. My responsibilities include faculty standardization among the pre-clinic and clinical faculty as well as the organization of programs and presentations directed at dental hygiene topics. I have presented and participated in instrument standardization workshops in the DH program and enjoy the process. I have presented posters at national association meetings on various topics. My interests include faculty standardization, promotion, development, and advising. I have worked with part time faculty on projects for submission for degree completion and publication. I have enjoyed participating on several major funded research projects as clinical examiner, and I am interested in advising on research opportunities both in-house and beyond NYUCD.                Mitchell Lipp, DDS   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Orthodontics   Academy Title: Member   Academy Role: Past Chairperson         Personal Statement:  I have been teaching full-time at the College for over twenty years ... and have never loved it more than right now. This is an incredible transformational moment in education. New technologies have liberated learning from the confines of the classroom. A convergence of information from learning theory, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience has deepened our understanding of how people learn. Even the very purpose of education has come into question. &quot;Habits of the mind&quot; ... critical thinking, reasoning, problem solving, self-directed learning, metacognition ... are now highly valued skills (some of these are standards for accreditation!) To me teaching is an experiment. My goal is to improve teaching and learning based on reason and evidence. The experiment continues as new methods of instruction and assessment are evaluated and confounders identified.   My background is varied: a camp counselor and group leader, a 6th grade classroom teacher, a clinical orthodontist, a dental educator, course director, and program director. My interest in education is evident in my activity and student mentorship at the College. In preparation for the next annual ADEA session, I am working (with students and faculty colleagues) on the following projects:     A Framework for Teaching Critical Thinking in Dental Education   Building a Pipeline: Dental Career Program for Underprivileged Middle-School Children   Learning with digital games: The future of dental education?   Can additional assessments improve student achievement in a competency-based course? A Case Report   Anatomy of a Course Evaluation: Guiding Principles to optimize accurate and useful feedback   DIVERSITY: Emergence and evolution in dental education   Ten things every dental educator should know                  Ronald I. Maitland, DMD   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  My background of professional interests has been varied. I have presented over 400 full day and multi-day educational seminars nationally and internationally on subjects that include restorative dentistry, esthetics, prosthodontics, emergency medicine, ethics, jurisprudence, risk management and initial licensure readiness skills. At NYUCD, I lead a weekly section in treatment planning called Morning Rounds, monitor restorative and communication competencies, As an author, I have over 20 publications covering a wide variety of clinically related subjects have appeared in peer reviewed journals. I sit on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry and the Board of Overseers for the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. A main thrust of my service to the profession has been involved in championing professional responsibility of dentists for public protection and safety. Monitoring professional conduct, as a 22 year experience on the New York State Board for Dentistry, has laid a groundwork for a keen interest in ethical sensitivity of students and practitioners.   My teaching thrust is to encourage synthesis and coordination of the basic sciences and didactic knowledge with clinical acumen. This bringing together of thought processes to form an accurate and competent diagnosis can not be understated. Individual clinical experiences during patient care have to be shared among groups of students for a broader exposure to learning opportunities.                Maureen McAndrew, DDS, MSED   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Clinical Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  As Senior Director of Professional Development at NYUCD, I serve as the program director for the Teaching in Dental Education (T.I.D.E.) Fellowship Program and created and direct the Excellence in Clinical Teaching Program and Class ACTS (Advanced Clinical Teaching Scholars) program. I am also the course director for the Practicum in Clinical Teaching for fourth-year dental students with an interest in academia. Additionally, I teach Introduction to Pedagogy to all post-graduate students and also teach restorative dentistry and practice management. I have lectured extensively and consulted on faculty development, pedagogy, faculty hiring and retention, generational issues, domestic violence, and conflict resolution.   My publications concern faculty development, teaching methodologies, on-line programming and domestic violence. I serve on the Editorial Review Board of the Journal of Dental Education and as Chair of the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) Section on Educational Research, Development and Curriculum.                Marjan Moghadam, DDS, MA   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Prosthodontics   Academy Title: Chairperson         Personal Statement:  I teach preclinical and clinical courses for pre-doctoral students as well as in the post-doctoral program. On the clinic floor I teach prosthodontics and I direct literature review courses related to fixed prosthodontics for post-doctoral residents.   My passion and the work I enjoy doing most centers on developing teaching materials for predoctoral students (such as manuals) and am most interested in bridging the gap between simulation care and translation to patient care. In other words, how do we translate what students learn on the manikin in a simulation module to what happens in the dental chair with the patient. I also am very interested in the process of sharing unique clinical findings which I have focused on using online media as well as poster presentations in our Showcase.                Mary Northridge, PhD, MPH   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Assistant Professor   Department: Epidemiology and Health Promotion   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I teach Epidemiology and Critical Thinking for the Dental Student to the D1 class. I am VERY interested in building upon the knowledge I gained this year to better ensure that we create student-centered, responsive learning experiences for every student enrolled. I also mentor summer research and honors students on defined projects, for example, Michele Equinda (D2 honors student) on Scoping Up Dental Education to Address HPV-Related Oropharyngeal Cancer, which she presented at the ADEA conference in March 2013.   My long-term teaching goals are to better integrate oral health with public health histories, theories, methods, and tools, including through educating dental students as part of integrated, community-based service delivery programs. I would love to teach a seminar in Social Determinants of Oral Health and conduct workshops on writing for peer-reviewed publication for students and faculty.   I have been teaching professionally for over 3 decades, and always have more fun when I am paired with a co-instructor with complementary expertise. Students are excited about the different perspectives that are brought to bear on the questions at hand, and enriched through the debate that ensues.                Ivy D. Peltz, DDS, MSED   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care         Personal Statement:  I am a clinical associate professor and Group Practice Director in the department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care. I hold a Masters in Higher Education and I'm currently ABD (all but dissertation) in a PhD program in Higher Education at Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development at New York University. My dissertation topic is the transfer of knowledge from theory to application, but I'm interested in anything and everything related to teaching, particularly topics that could result in improved teaching and learning for our community.                Joan A. Phelan, DDS   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Honorary Fellow                                       Rebecca Poling, DDS, MSD   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Clinical Assistant Professor   Department: Orthodontics   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I direct the Predoctoral Invisalign Clinic, give orthodontic consults in all of the General Practice Clinics, and teach some sessions in different courses. I believe learning new information should be fun and exciting.   My role as a teacher is to facilitate student learning so that students will want to learn. In the end, we cannot make anyone learn if he or she is not receptive. So my job is to figure out the essential information for students to know, what is the most accurate information now, and how may I organize it so each student learns it efficiently.   For the past fifteen years I have been involved in electronic learning, from CD-ROM presentations and now online presentations. I currently use online presentations that I develop to teach students how to perform procedures in the Invisalign Clinic. My latest area of interest is to track student &quot;learning&quot; from online presentations by measuring a student\u2019s online viewing time and immediate recall &quot;quiz question&quot; score. This learning data then is compared to clinical performance measures as recorded on an iPad. I call this project &quot;Learning Analytics.&quot; The final objective is to help each student recognize when he has learned or not learned the procedure so that he knows when his clinical outcome is acceptable or not acceptable. Faculty members then are mentors instead of &quot;graders&quot; and students take responsibility for their own learning.   I look forward to sharing these thoughts and interests with other members and faculty and exploring exciting new ways of learning and teaching!                                       Stefanie Russell, DDS, MPH, PhD   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Epidemiology         Personal Statement:  I am a periodontist and an epidemiologist and am currently an Associate Clinical Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion. I maintain a clinical practice that focuses primarily on the periodontal care of medically compromised adults, and I teach at the dental undergraduate (currently as the course director for the D3 &quot;Skills in Assessing the Professional Literature&quot; course) and at the master's level.   I have developed a research program that focuses on the oral health of vulnerable populations, including women, the elderly and low-income and racial-ethnic minority groups. My current primary research interest is the oral health of pregnant women and models of safe and effective dental care delivery for pregnant women.                Miriam Robbins, DDS, MS   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I am a clinical associate professor in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology, and Medicine. My primary didactic and teaching responsibilities center on providing dental care to patients with who are medically complex, physically and/or intellectually challenged. I am the Director of the Special Needs Clinic and the course director of a D3 course titled &quot;Care of the Medically Complex Patient&quot;. I am interested in exploring the ways to facilitate active learning, utilizing new technology to present didactic content to the students and employing the concepts of &quot;the inverted classroom&quot; to help students integrate and apply information in a clinical setting.                Andrew Schenkel, DMD, MS   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Cariology and Comprehensive Care   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I am the newly appointed Associate Director of Community Based Dental Education in the Department of Cariology and Comprehensive Care. In addition to organizing local community outreach events, I am responsible for the oversight of students placed in community facilities providing comprehensive dental care as part of a mini residency elective program. I am currently working to expand the program and develop additional sites so that every student can spend a significant amount of time providing dental care for patients in a community setting.     Before assuming this new position I was formerly a Group Practice Director for six years and also served as mentor for a group of 2-4 freshmen each year. I currently serve on the curriculum review committee, the evidence based practice steering committee, and I am chair of the part time faculty appointments and promotions committee. I also serve as an evidence based dentistry champion for the ADA and I have made multiple presentations on the subject at the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) annual meetings. I am passionate about teaching effectively in order to improve patient care and I am eager to work with anyone with similar interests.              Silvia Spivakovsky, DDS   Year Entered: 2012   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology &amp; Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I teach both in the clinic and lecture where I seek to implement Evidence Based Practice philosophy as a way to promote active learning. I'm also interested in implementing techniques to promote better integration between both the classroom and the clinic as well as between the basic sciences and the clinic. I am a proponent of case based learning and believe we need more multidisciplinary cases to help with the integration process. I enjoy working in small groups (even if that means having to repeat the same thing several times), learning about new technologies and working collaboratively.                Louis Terracio, PhD   Year Entered: 2013   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Vice Dean for Research   Academy Title: Honorary Fellow                                       Analia Veitz-Keenan, DDS   Year Entered: 2011   NYUCD Title: Clinical Associate Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I teach and direct in the Admissions Clinic of the Oral Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine Department where I'm always looking for new techniques for teaching to make the students' experience the most enjoyable and productive rotation they have with us.   After spending several years learning about the topic, I am now practicing Evidence Based Dentistry, which I teach to students and colleagues at NYUCD, as well as interested national and international audiences. Recently, building on the alliance we started with the Cochrane Oral Health Group (COHG), I have co- authored several systematic review protocols and I have been organizing workshops with COHG.   I have also had the pleasure of being involved in a range of projects such as helping students in their presentations related to Evidence Based Dentistry to assisting my colleagues in scholarly activities such as preparing articles for journals and presentations for ADEA and AADR/IADR.              Anthony Vernillo, DDS, PHD, MBE   Year Entered: 2010   NYUCD Title: Professor   Department: Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Pathology, Radiology and Medicine   Academy Title: Member         Personal Statement:  I have taken a sabbatical leave for approximately six months from September 1, 2013 to February 15, 2014 to work on ethics curriculum with a colleague at the University of the Western Cape (UWC), Cape Town. I am keenly interested in bringing more into the ethics curriculum at NYUCD. UWC is in the process of developing a more coherent approach to the teaching and learning of bioethics, and specifically the bioethics of dental research. That initiative at UWC has thus far attempted to address the content and instructional design of the undergraduate and postgraduate curricula to establish tools for delivery to on-site and distance learning students. I look forward to working at UWC with e-Learning, proven text and case-learning formats, face-to-face encounters, and emerging interactive technologies to enhance the learning process and develop assessments for that process.   The sabbatical at UWC should give me better tools for delivery and adding bioethics courses to the curriculum at NYUCD. As Affiliated Faculty to the Center for Bioethics at NYU Washington Square, I have been asked to join a twelve member panel from NYU and develop bioethics curriculum for the master's degree at the postgraduate level. In his thesis on evolution, Darwin argued that nature does not take giant leaps but small steps. In that regard, I will also start with the systemic pathology course that I teach to the undergraduate students at NYUCD. I have been hesitant to add bioethics to this course given the precious little time to teach pathology. But that will change. So, in the not too distant future, I will add lectures on the ethics of heart transplantation and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) to the cardiovascular component to the course; and scarcity of resources and distributive justice as it pertains to those on waiting lists in renal dialysis. It will be a small step but a way to gauge students' initial responses.                Johanna Warshaw, PhD   Year Entered: 2014   NYUCD Title: Research Assistant Professor   Department: Basic Science and Craniofacial Biology   Academy Title: Member             Personal Statement:  I am a biological anthropologist, with interests in primate evolution, development and behaviors as they are recorded in the microstructures of bone and fossil bone. I teach Head and Neck Anatomy lectures and conferences, as well as conferences for the Organ Systems and the NBDE Part I Review Course and lectures as part of the Dental Hygiene curriculum. I manage the Head and Neck Anatomy NYU Classes interface, and maintain and edit online teaching materials for the course, as well as online testing modules. I am also involved in the creation of online learning modules for the NBDE Part I Review Course. I love teaching in conference settings where there is the opportunity to engage in discussions and encourage student driven learning.&amp;nbsp; I enjoy lecture based teaching as well, and am interested in the study of how learners best acquire and retain knowledge, and the ways in which various presentation techniques and aides work to promote student interest and retention.
