This has involved study in the burgeoning field of neuroeconomics, as well as in the psychology of decision-making and social neuroscience. I have been conducting a series of studies in collaboration with Colin Camerer's lab at the California Institute of Technology, studying the phenomenon of loss aversion using behavioral methods, physiological measurements (including skin conductance and startle eyeblink), and functional imaging. To this work we have brought a parameterized study of the use of strategies in choice behavior, and shown that people can intentionally change how they make decisions, in a very specific and reliable fashion, and that these changes result not only in changes in the decisions people make, but also in their physiological reactions to wins and losses, and in their brain activity. Some projects that are currently in development are aimed at more explicitly examining the relationship between arousal and decision-making, with pharmacological methods or induction techniques borrowed from other areas of psychology. I also have some ongoing collaborations with other members of my lab, investigating the relationship between implicit and explicit beliefs and decision behavior in social contexts.    Before NYU, I studied at Dartmouth College with Prof. William Kelley, Prof. George Wolford, and Dr. Joe Moran on an fMRI study of neural activity when anticipating and receiving rewards and punishments, and at Stanford University with Prof. John Gabrieli, Dr. Noa Ofen, and Dr. Ching Kao on studies involving the cognitive reappraisal of emotion, priming effects on judgments of learning, and the development of long term memory and executive functions.   In the fall of 2010, I anticipate beginning a postdoctoral fellowship with Professor Antonio Rangel at the California Institute of Technology.
