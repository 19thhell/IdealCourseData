She did her Doctorate in Russian History at Yale. She published her dissertation on the origins of the Zaporogian (Ukrainian) cossacks, but soon left that region behind to become one of a pioneering generation of historians of the US examining women and gender. Before coming to NYU in 1998 Gordon taught at the University of Wisconsin/Madison where she was awarded the university's most prestigious chair professorship, the Vilas Research Chair. Today she is a University Professor of the Humanities and professor of history at NYU, teaching courses on gender, social movements, imperialism and the 20th-century US in general. She has won many prestigious awards, including Guggenheim, NEH, ACLS, Radcliffe Institute and the New York Public Library\u00b9s Cullman Center fellowships.     For the first part of her career, most of Gordon's writing examined the historical roots of contemporary social policy debates in the US, particularly as they concern gender and family issues. Her first book, Woman's Body, Woman's Right: The History of Birth Control in America (Viking/Penguin, 1976), published in 1976 and reissued in 1990, remains the definitive history of birth-control politics in the US. It was completely revised and re-published as The Moral Property of Women in 2002. In 1988 she published a historical study of how the US has dealt with family violence, including child abuse, book, spousal violence and sexual abuse. Heroes of Their Own Lives: The History and Politics of Family Violence (Viking/Penguin, 1988) won the Joan Kelly prize of the American Historical Association. Gordon served on the Departments of Justice/Health and Human Services Advisory Council on Violence Against Women for the Clinton administration (a council abolished by the Bush administration). Her history of welfare, Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare (Free Press, 1994), won the Berkshire Prize and the Gustavus Myers Human Rights Award.     Changing direction, Gordon turned to narrative as a way of bringing large-scale historical developments to life. Her 1999 book, The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction, the story of a vigilante action against Mexican-Americans, won the Bancroft prize for best book in American history and the Beveridge prize for best book on the history of the Western Hemisphere. In the process of researching her most recent book, she discovered an important group of Lange photographs long unnoticed and never published: photographs of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, commissioned by the US Army but then impounded because they were too critical of the internment policy. Gordon selected 119 of this images and published them in 2006, with introductory essays by herself and by historian Gary Okihiro, as Impounded: Dorothea Lange and Japanese Americans in World War II.

She did her Doctorate in Russian History at Yale. She published her dissertation on the origins of the Zaporogian (Ukrainian) cossacks, but soon left that region behind to become one of a pioneering generation of historians of the US examining women and gender. Before coming to NYU in 1998 Gordon taught at the University of Wisconsin/Madison where she was awarded the university's most prestigious chair professorship, the Vilas Research Chair. Today she is a University Professor of the Humanities and professor of history at NYU, teaching courses on gender, social movements, imperialism and the 20th-century US in general. She has won many prestigious awards, including Guggenheim, NEH, ACLS, Radcliffe Institute and the New York Public Library\u00b9s Cullman Center fellowships.     For the first part of her career, most of Gordon's writing examined the historical roots of contemporary social policy debates in the US, particularly as they concern gender and family issues. Her first book, Woman's Body, Woman's Right: The History of Birth Control in America (Viking/Penguin, 1976), published in 1976 and reissued in 1990, remains the definitive history of birth-control politics in the US. It was completely revised and re-published as The Moral Property of Women in 2002. In 1988 she published a historical study of how the US has dealt with family violence, including child abuse, book, spousal violence and sexual abuse. Heroes of Their Own Lives: The History and Politics of Family Violence (Viking/Penguin, 1988) won the Joan Kelly prize of the American Historical Association. Gordon served on the Departments of Justice/Health and Human Services Advisory Council on Violence Against Women for the Clinton administration (a council abolished by the Bush administration). Her history of welfare, Pitied But Not Entitled: Single Mothers and the History of Welfare (Free Press, 1994), won the Berkshire Prize and the Gustavus Myers Human Rights Award.     Changing direction, Gordon turned to narrative as a way of bringing large-scale historical developments to life. Her 1999 book, The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction, the story of a vigilante action against Mexican-Americans, won the Bancroft prize for best book in American history and the Beveridge prize for best book on the history of the Western Hemisphere. In the process of researching her most recent book, she discovered an important group of Lange photographs long unnoticed and never published: photographs of the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, commissioned by the US Army but then impounded because they were too critical of the internment policy. Gordon selected 119 of this images and published them in 2006, with introductory essays by herself and by historian Gary Okihiro, as Impounded: Dorothea Lange and Japanese Americans in World War II.

In addition to histories of gender and sexuality, she specializes in U.S. history, African American history, the African diaspora, and intellectual history. Her research interests also include the history of medicine. She has served as an elected member of the National Council of the American Studies Association (2009-2012) and was a member of the ASA\u2019s Executive Committee from 2010-2012. She recently completed her last year (2011-2014) on the Executive Board of the Organization of American Historians. The Organization of American Historians appointed her as a Distinguished Lecturer from 2010-2013. In addition to being a 2001-2002 Schomburg Center & National Endowment for the Humanities Scholar-in-Residence at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture (New York Public Library), Mitchell has received a range of fellowship support for her work. Mitchell has also worked as a researcher for two major documentary projects: \u201cBehind the Veil: Documenting African-American Life in the Jim Crow South\u201d (Duke University); and the Martin Luther King, Jr., Papers Project (Stanford University). Mitchell is now writing a book that is tentatively entitled Idle Anxieties: Youth, Race, and Sexuality during the Great Depression. Above and beyond considering myriad ways in which idleness among workers, transients, and the poor was deemed a threat to social order, Idle Anxieties will examine how concerns about youth and idleness were suffused with gendered, sexualized, raced, and classed meanings as it considers changing notions of time, productivity, and leisure during economically slack years.
