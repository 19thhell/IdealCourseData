During its first year, the group organized several small panel discussions as well as larger events with noted guest speakers, including Zachary Metz, the director of Peace Building at Consensus, and Aldo Civico, the director of Columbia University's Center for International Conflict Resolution. This year, PACT hopes to provide students with the opportunity to discuss issues relating to international conflict and peacemaking and to connect with practitioners from the field.

The journal was created in 2006 and published its first edition on &quot;Development Issues&quot; the same year. PGI aims to encourage dialogue and analysis of issues that are critically relevant in the global arena by creating a forum for discussion and debate on a wide range of subjects that affect the community. These include but are not limited to issues of international law, human rights, development, globalization, public health, international finance and trade, security, and the environment.

THRILL is unique in that it focuses on issues and topics that put the needs of the human being first- not the needs of the state, the shareholder, the donor or the recipient, an industry, or even the international community as a whole. As a growing concentration, it should follow suit that human rights and international law students have adequate representation in academia, student affairs, SCPS events and external networks. THRILL exists to help bridge this gap in three particular ways:     Host events and discussions that fit our academic and career interests and goals;     Hold student discussion groups to debate and discuss issues relevant to the field of     international law and human rights;     Advocate for events and initiatives related to human rights and international law within the MSGA program as a whole.         THRILL is open to any student interested in the topic areas.

In the form of the hugely popular Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (and the Tolkien originals they were based on), the currently popular novel Eragon, the recent Dungeons and Dragons craze, and the never-ending series of television, movie, and novel treatments of King Arthur, Beowulf, and other heroes, the medieval imagination has fascinated the contemporary mind. Beyond the popular, poets such as T. S. Eliot, historians like the Marxist Marc Bloch, and visual artists such as Paul Gauguin have likewise referenced the Middle Ages in their art and thought. Our course will try to answer this question by exploring the medieval originals\u2014Beowulf, the Icelandic Sagas, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and their analogues in medieval visual art\u2014and their later incarnations, including the novel The Hobbit, films such as The Seventh Seal, Rashomon, and The Adventures of Robin Hood, and their pre-modern, Romantic predecessors (such as the novels of Walter Scott and the poetry of the Rossettis).

During its first year, the group organized several small panel discussions as well as larger events with noted guest speakers, including Zachary Metz, the director of Peace Building at Consensus, and Aldo Civico, the director of Columbia University's Center for International Conflict Resolution. This year, PACT hopes to provide students with the opportunity to discuss issues relating to international conflict and peacemaking and to connect with practitioners from the field.

The journal was created in 2006 and published its first edition on &quot;Development Issues&quot; the same year. PGI aims to encourage dialogue and analysis of issues that are critically relevant in the global arena by creating a forum for discussion and debate on a wide range of subjects that affect the community. These include but are not limited to issues of international law, human rights, development, globalization, public health, international finance and trade, security, and the environment.

THRILL is unique in that it focuses on issues and topics that put the needs of the human being first- not the needs of the state, the shareholder, the donor or the recipient, an industry, or even the international community as a whole. As a growing concentration, it should follow suit that human rights and international law students have adequate representation in academia, student affairs, SCPS events and external networks. THRILL exists to help bridge this gap in three particular ways:     Host events and discussions that fit our academic and career interests and goals;     Hold student discussion groups to debate and discuss issues relevant to the field of     international law and human rights;     Advocate for events and initiatives related to human rights and international law within the MSGA program as a whole.         THRILL is open to any student interested in the topic areas.

White If  you want something a bit more philosophical and character-driven, this  is it. This is in my view the most comprehensive version of King Arthur  other than Malory, since it takes you deep into the motivations of each character and event. Timeless and thought-provoking!  The Pendragon Cycle by Stephen Lawhead To be quite honest, I'm not a huge fan of Stephen Lawhead. I've read his Song of Albion ,  and couldn't finish it due to the skewed perspective of the narrator.  However, his books are still quite readable and enjoyable (especially  for guys, I think).  The Idylls of the Queen by Phyllis Ann Karr Everyone  who's read this book has loved it, with good reason. Again, I love  character depth, and this one takes a short episode from Malory and  investigates the characters involved at length. It's a murder mystery  that's action-packed but still packs an emotional punch.  The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley Another  long, birth-to-death retelling of the legend, this time from the  ladies' perspective. In my opinion it's somewhat shaky at times, and  like most works of literature has its ups and downs, but it should be  required reading for anyone interested in the role of women in Celtic  society.  The Arthurian Saga by Mary Stewart The first three books comprise a trilogy beginning with The Crystal Cave ,  and take a very sympathetic look at the mysterious man behind the  Pendragon throne--Merlin. Stewart's storytelling ability is terrific,  and the books develop a personal feel without losing the grandeur of  the Arthurian legends. The last book of the series, The Wicked Day , has been more criticized but still has generally good reviews; it switches to the point of view of Mordred.   Greek  and Roman mythology   \"The Illiad\" and \"The Odyssey\" by Homer These  are classics for good reason--anyone dipping their toes into mythology  should try them! I've heard reports that the audio versions are just as  enjoyable, since these poems were meant to be recited, not read;  however, I'll have to get back to you on my favorite translation.  The Greek Myths by Robert Graves This  collection is probably the most comprehensive set you'll find anywhere;  although scholars use Graves' retellings and interpretations, the  casual reader shouldn't find this book hard at all. It comes in two  volumes.   D'Aulaire's Book of Greek Myths by Ingri and Edgar d'Aulaire This  book was my first introduction to Greek myths; although it's intended  for children, adults should still enjoy flipping through the beautiful  illustrations and getting a quick recap of the Greek myths and legends.  Very clearly and concisely told, the book also connects together the  universe of the Greek myths for young readers."}]}]
