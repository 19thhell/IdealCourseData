As the autonomous and disparate OWS media efforts bypass mainstream channels again and again, whether they be print, Web or televised media, or corporate, police or government spokespeople, it is clear that this disparate group speaks in a vernacular that can only be understood as of the Internet age, and does so horizontally instead of the   traditional print-based verticality of the past.

And we look at the promise it offers in its ability to communicate in new ways and to open up new channels of democratic dialogue and participation.   - Keith Miller , Curator          \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0Isaiah King \u00a0          Keith Miller, Dread Scott, Stephen Duncombe     \u00a0Dread Scott   Michael Rippens\u00a0             \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Melanie Cervantes Melanie Cervantes MelanieBaker \u00a0Melanie Baker    \u00a0Dread Scott                                                   The Gallery at The Gallatin School for Individualized Study              Gallatin Arts Festival 2015   Past shows   About   Contact                                   Proudly powered by WordPress"}, {"content": "Is This What Democracy Looks Like: Tisch School of the Arts at NYU                           Skip to content        Art &amp; Public Policy Home Masters in Arts Politics Center for Art and Public Policy Course Offerings News and Events Faculty Twitter Facebook  home &gt; Art and Public Policy        Is This What Democracy Looks Like: Art, Elections & Beyond  H48.1041/ 2041 Sem 4 Credits Instructor(s): Caron Atlas Is This What Democracy Looks Like: Art, Elections &amp; Beyond    Professor Caron Atlas    H48.1041-001 (Undergraduate)    H48.2041.001 (Graduate)    Thursdays, 4- 6:45pm    Undergraduate and Graduate    4 points    The goal of this course is to broaden our perspective and deepen our understanding of the intersection between art, culture, democracy, and community change. Our discussions will be grounded in the principles and values of how participatory democracy connects to systemic change, and how artists and creative organizers can play an integral role in this process. Our context will be the political, social, and economic transformations that will be unfolding this spring.    The class will emphasize dialogue, inquiry, and on-the-ground experience. The instructor will bring her networks and experiences of linking art and activism through the Arts &amp; Democracy Project, Animating Democracy, Place + Displace, and the Initiative for Art &amp; Community Change. Students will bring their volunteer experiences and projects; and guest artists, organizers, urban planners, and policymakers will stimulate critical thinking and reflection through their range of practice.    We will develop a series of questions to pose to ourselves and our guests about: the intentions and approaches of our work, our concepts and strategies for change, the systems that support and sustain the work, the methodologies and processes we engage, and the impact of the work. We will consider the relationship between creativity and strategy and build our capacity to work across disciplines and sectors.    Ideally students will come from all disciplines in the arts, with students from liberal arts and sciences, education, community organizing, and public service also encouraged to enroll.    This course will count toward general education requirements for TSOA students (Social Science).
