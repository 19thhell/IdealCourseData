His songs and productions have appeared on nearly 80 million records by artists ranging from Celine Dion to Sheryl Crow, from Aaron Neville to Beyonc&eacute;, from Brandy to Kurt Elling. \"Save the Best For Last,\" recorded by Vanessa Williams, simultaneously topped Billboard's pop, R&amp;B, and A/C charts for three weeks and was nominated for a GRAMMY&reg; as Song of the Year. It also earned nominations for Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Female. \"Save&hellip;\" was honored as ASCAP's Song of the Year, certifying it as the most-performed song of 1992-93, and received an ASCAP R&amp;B Award, as well. It was the number one pop record for eight weeks and remained on the charts for another eight months. At nearly 4,000,000 airplay performances to date, it is already one of the classic songs of this, or any, era. Among Phil's other well-known songs are: \"Someone Watching Over You\" (Yolanda Adams), \"I Owe You One\" (Aaron Neville), \"It's Not Over (Til It's Over)\" (Starship), \"That's Not the Way It's S'posed To Be\" (Anne Murray), \"A World Without Love\" (Eddie Rabbitt), \"The Last To Know\" and \"Love Doesn't Ask Why\" (Celine Dion), and \"Why Don't We Live Together\" (Barry Manilow). \"The Sweetest Days,\" the title song from Vanessa's platinum album, was the number one A/C record for eight weeks, charted for 25 on the Billboard Hot 100, and received an ASCAP Pop Award as one of the most-performed songs of 1995. \"One Voice\" was featured on Brandy's multi-platinum, number one Never S-A-Y Never , and served as the theme for her role as UNICEF spokesperson. \"Fly,\" one of three of Phil's on Celine's number one, 28x platinum, GRAMMY&reg;-winning Falling Into You has inspired millions (and a few websites) with its expression of faith in the face of grief. Phil has produced tracks and albums by such artists as Yolanda Adams, America, Jody Watley, Starship, Vanessa Williams, John Sebastian, and The Temptations. He produced and co-wrote the critically acclaimed album Like A Brother by Gerry Beckley (of America), Robert Lamm (of Chicago), and the late Carl Wilson (of The Beach Boys). In addition, he produced GRAMMY&reg;-nominated comedy albums for both Robert Klein and Robin Williams. Phil has served as a music supervisor for both film and TV (including a season of the legendary Miami Vice ). He has scored four motion pictures, and his songs and productions are regularly featured on cable and network television and have appeared in the soundtracks of numerous films, including: The First Wives Club , Music Of The Heart , The Best Man , Cocktail , The Firm , Priscilla, Queen of the Desert , Upside Of Anger , D efinitely Maybe , What Happens In Vegas , Seven Girlfriends , C-A-M-P , and Mind the Gap . Phil&rsquo;s work has appeared on thirteen GRAMMY&reg;-nominated or -winning recordings. He has been honored with the Grand Prize of the American Song Festival, two Nashville Songwriters' Association citations, a Cable ACE and DOVE Award nominations, four ASCAP awards, and the prestigious \"Time For Peace Award.&rdquo; He speaks frequently on intellectual property rights, was Songwriter in Residence at the Berklee College of Music, has lectured at numerous colleges and universities, and has just been named Affiliate Faculty in the Music Business Program at NYU&rsquo;s Steinhardt School. He is an elected leader of The Recording Academy, where he serves or has served as national Trustee, N.Y.
