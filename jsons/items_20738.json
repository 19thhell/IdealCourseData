The Department of Performance Studies is the first program in the world to focus on performance as the object of analysis. Our programs explore the ways that performance creates meaning and shapes social life. \"Performance\" is at the center of the theoretical, historical, and methodological courses offered. Courses train students to document, theorize, and analyze embodied practices and events. A provisional coalescence on the move, performance studies is more than the sum of its inclusions.    Performances    We study actual performances, from postmodern dance and Hip Hop to world's fairs and orature, from performance art and staged dramas to spirit possession, political rallies, and the law court, from Butoh and vaudeville to capoeira, Olympics and jazz.    Performance As Lens    We use performance as an organizing concept for studying a wide range of behaviors and situations, from museums and food to landscape and the aesthetics of everyday life. We use performance as a theoretical lens for thinking about how elections are organized or how gender, race, and sexuality are performative (and often performances).    Intercultural    We explore Latin/o-American, Caribbean, African and African-American, Asian and Asian-American, European, and American performance. Performance Studies challenges aesthetic hierarchies and analyzes how they are formed.    Interdisciplinary    We start with a set of concerns and objects and range widely for what we need by way of theory and method. By theorizing embodiment, event, and agency in relation to live (and mediated) performance, Performance Studies can contribute to other new fields, such as Cultural Studies and Visual Culture. We draw on such fields as anthropology, theatre, and history. Our courses explore feminist, queer, postcolonial, Marxist, psychoanalytic, and critical race theory. Our methods of research and analysis include fieldwork, interviews, archival research, and movement analysis.    Theory and Practice    We integrate theory and practice in workshops and courses in performance composition, performance writing, dramaturgy, theories of directing, and performance and technology. Guests artists have included Yvonne Rainer, August Boal, Holly Hughes, Carmelita Tropicana, Ricardo Dominguez, and Deborah Margolis.    New York City    We are situated in New York City's legendary Greenwich Village and encourage students to take full advantage of the city's unparalleled resources for seeing performances of all kinds, conducting research, and professional development. Several of our courses require students to use the city - with its many neighborhoods and subcultures - as a \"lab\" for exploring theories of everyday practice. Some courses also provide students with the opportunity to collaborate with New York City artists.

Given a dataset of points the goal is to preprocess it so that,           given a query point close to some data point, return a data point that           is not too far from the query. If one insists on the space being           subquadratic in the number of points (the most important regime in           practice), the only known technique for tackling ANN until recently was           Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) introduced by Indyk and Motwani in           1998. Since then, LSH has been proved very influential both in theory           and in practice.                     During the talk, I will introduce LSH and state certain fundamental           limitations of it. Then, I will talk about a recent line of work that           overcomes them. That is, I will show first data structures for ANN that           are provably better than the best possible LSH-based ones. In           particular, for the first time, we are able to improve upon           [Indyk-Motwani 1998] for the Hamming distance, and [Andoni-Indyk 2006]           for the Euclidean distance.                     The key technique is *data-dependent hashing*: we tailor the hash family           to a given set of data points; this approach has strong parallels with           the practice of ANN. Our hashing schemes are *optimal* in the class of           data-dependent hashing. The key technical tool is a regularity-type           decomposition: we show how to partition a *worst-case* dataset into           several parts that look *random*.                     The talk is based on a joint work with Alex Andoni (Simons Institute)           that can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01062 .

[+]                                           Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can be posed as structured prediction,          where the goal is to predict a labeling or structured object. For          example, the input may be an image or a sentence, and the output is a          labeling such as an assignment of each pixel in the image to          foreground or background, or the parse tree for the sentence. Despite          marginal and MAP inference for many of these models being NP-hard in          the worst-case, approximate inference algorithms are remarkably          successful and as a result structured prediction is widely used.                     What makes these real-world instances different from worst-case          instances? One key difference is that in all of these applications,          there is an underlying \"ground truth\" which structured prediction is          aiming to find. In this talk, I will introduce a new theoretical          framework for analyzing structured prediction algorithms in terms of          their ability to achieve small Hamming error. We study the          computational and statistical trade-offs that arise in this setting,          and illustrate a setting where polynomial-time algorithms can perform          optimal prediction, despite the corresponding MAP inference task being          NP-hard.

This matches the known lower bound of O(k \\log(N/k)) up to constant factors for any k\\leq N^{1-\\delta}. The algorithm runs in near-linear time, and provides the so-called \\ell_2/\\ell_2 guarantee. Our algorithm extends to higher dimensions, leading to sample complexity of O_d(k\\log N), which is again optimal up to constant factors for any constant d. This is the first sample optimal algorithm for these problems.   Using similar techniques, we also obtain an algorithm with slightly suboptimal sample complexity O(k\\log N (\\log\\log N)^2) and a sub-linear time O(k \\log^{O(1)} N) for any constant d. This generalizes the result of [IKP] to higher dimensions.   We also present preliminary experimental evaluation of our sample-optimal near-linear time algorithm, indicating that the empirical sampling complexity of the algorithm is comparable to that of other recovery methods known in the literature, while providing strong provable guarantees on the recovery quality.

Despite much effort          over the years, not much is known on the largest possible sizes of such families,          and a wide gap remains between the best known constructions and upper bounds.          In this work we derive a new upper bound on the sizes of families that possess this property,          improving a result by Urbanke and Li. To that end, we introduce a soft variation of the          Sauer-Perles-Shelah Lemma, that is then used in conjunction with an information-theoretic           argument for a more general setup.

Friday February 13         2:15PM         WWH 1314                                                         Elliot Anshelevich (RPI)                                         Stable Matching, Friendship, and Altruism                                [+]                                           Abstract: We will discuss both integral and fractional versions of \"correlated stable matching\"          problems. Each player is a node in a social network and strives to form a good match with a          neighboring player; the player utilities from forming a match are correlated. We consider          the existence, computation, and inefficiency of stable matchings from which no pair of players          wants to deviate. We especially focus on networks where players are embedded in a social context,          and may incorporate friendship relations or altruism into their decisions.                     When the benefits from a match are the same for both players, we show that incorporating the          well-being of other players into their matching decisions significantly decreases the price of          stability, while the price of anarchy remains unaffected. Furthermore, a good stable matching          achieving the price of stability bound always exists and can be reached in polynomial time. We          extend these results to more general matching rewards, when players matched to each other may          receive different utilities from the match. For this more general case, we show that incorporating          social context (i.e., \"caring about your friends\") can make an even larger difference, and greatly          reduce the price of anarchy. Finally, we extend most of our results to network contribution games,          in which players can decide how much effort to contribute to each incident edge, instead of simply          choosing a single node to match with.

Approximate degree has wide-ranging applications in theoretical computer science,          from computational learning theory to communication, query, and circuit complexity. Despite its importance,          our understanding of approximate degree remains somewhat limited, with few general results known.                      The focus of this talk will be on a relatively new method for proving lower bounds on approximate degree:          specifying \\emph{dual polynomials}, which are dual solutions to a certain linear program capturing the          approximate degree of any function. After surveying earlier work on approximate degree, I will describe          how the method of dual polynomials has recently enabled progress on several open problems.                     Based on joint work with Mark Bun                                                                              Friday March 27         2:15PM         WWH 1314                                                         Michael Forbes (IAS)                                         Dimension Expanders via Rank Condensers                                [+]                                           Abstract: Expander graphs are sparse graphs with good connectivity properties and they have           become ubiquitous in theoretical computer science. Dimension expanders are a linear-algebraic          variant where we ask for a constant number of linear maps that expand subspaces of a vector space          (instead of subsets of vertices). After their definition 10 years ago by Barak, Impagliazzo, Shpilka          and Wigderson there are now two constructions of constant-degree dimension expanders, both of which          suggest dimension expanders are more complicated than expander graphs.                     In this work, we give a new construction of constant-degree dimension expanders (over large fields)          which is quite simple. It follows from an emerging theory of linear-algebraic pseudorandomness where          the rank of a subspace plays the role of the min-entropy of a random variable. In particular, we use          the recent near-optimal construction of subspace designs by Guruswami and Kopparty (based on Wronskians)          to construct a near optimal \"lossy rank condenser\". This condenser, in addition to a tensoring operation,          yields the desired dimension expanders.

We give algorithms based on the sixth level of the          sum-of-squares hierarchy that work with roughly m = n^3/2 observations, and we complement our result by showing that any          attempt to solve tensor prediction with fewer observations through the sum-of-squares hierarchy would run in moderately          exponential time. In contrast, information theoretically roughly m = n observations suffice.                     This work is part of a broader agenda of studying computational vs. statistical tradeoffs through the sum-of-squares hierarchy.          In particular, for linear inverse problems (such as tensor prediction) the natural sum-of-squares relaxation gives rise to a          sequence of norms. Our approach is to characterize their Rademacher complexity. Moreover, both our upper and lower bounds are          based on connections between this, and the task of strongly refuting random 3-XOR formulas, and the resolution proof system.                     This talk is based on joint work with Boaz Barak                                                                               Friday April 24         2:00PM         WWH 512                                                         Yuval Filmus (IAS)                                         On the Coppersmith-Winograd approach to matrix multiplication                                [+]                                           Abstract:          Ever since Strassen's O(n^{2.81}) matrix multiplication algorithm stunned the mathematical community,          the quest for fast matrix multiplication algorithms has been a holy grail in computer science.          At first progress was fast, culminating in Coppersmith and Winograd's O(n^{2.376}) algorithm of 1987.          Recently interest in the area has reawakened due to work of Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams and Le Gall,          who managed to improve the exponent slightly from 2.376 to 2.373.                     Roughly speaking, Coppersmith and Winograd constructed an edifice turning an \"identity\"          (some kind of mathematical object) into a fast matrix multiplication algorithm.          Applying their method on the identity TCW, they obtained an O(n^{2.388}) algorithm.          Applying it to TCW^2 (identities can be squared!), they obtained their O(n^{2.376}) algorithm.          They stopped there since computing was a lot more cumbersome in the 1980s.          Using modern computers, Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams and Le Gall were able to analyze          higher powers of TCW (up to TCW^32), and so reduced the exponent to 2.373.                     Our talk answers the following question:                      What is the limit of this approach?                                 We show that this approach cannot yield an exponent smaller than 2.372.          No prior knowledge will be assumed.
