Xiao  Department of Cinema Studies      Call #: 75721      Fridays, 12:30p.m. \u2013  4:30p.m.      As China reopened to the world and  becomes the newly emerged superpower in the recent two decades, Chinese films  and other aspects of screen media have not only attracted worldwide scholarly  attentions and artistic interests, but also they have been embraced by a wide  range of popular tastes internationally. This course will examine Chinese  cinema in juxtaposition with popular culture and other forms of media such as  television, music, journalism in a broad sociopolitical and historical context.  While focusing specifically on film productions, cultural consumptions and  media representations in the contemporary era of mainland China, we will  place these discourses within a general framework of national tradition and  identity and track their evolutions from the beginning of the  twentieth-century. We will also look at these distinctive yet interrelated  phenomena from a comparative and cross-cultural perspective, by emphasizing the  heterogeneous and hybrid nature of Chinese culture and media. An interdisciplinary  approach (with the assistance of a wide diversity of readings and multimedia  tools) will be incorporated into our discussion that is especially concerned  with the concepts and configurations of urban modernity, youth subculture,  popular literature, music, the interactions between Shanghai and Hollywood, and  the narratives of food, sports and fashion on screen and across other media.
