Our recent work, as part of collaborative teams of systems biologists and  computational biologists, has recently resulted in genome-wide models that are capable of simulating the functioning of the genome in real time (Bonneau, et. al, 2006, Cell). Dr. Bonneau's lab develops new algorithms that attempt to learn the regulatory networks (their topology and dynamical parameters) that are at the core of biological systems. This work was featured in a 2008 Discover Article, where Dr. Bonneau was selected as one of the top 20 scientists under 40. This work is collaborative work that relies on NYU's local expertise in Machine Learning, Modeling complex systems and their dynamics, and Genomics.  Links:   Bonneau Lab     With Ph.D. student Eugene Weinstein and Google researcher Pedro Moreno, Mehryar Mohri is working on audio fingerprinting techniques that enable computers to recognize songs. This work represents songs in terms of \"music phonemes\", elementary units of music sound that are learned from data, and uses weighted finite-state transducers to construct a compact and efficient index of a large database of songs. The image depicts an example of such a transducer. As a result, songs can be recognized quickly and accurately when only a recording of a short \"audio snippet\" is available and even when the recording is distorted. The group has created a working system with a database of 15,000 songs. Moreover, it has proven new bounds on the size of the indexing finite automata used that guarantee the compactness of this representation as the number of songs indexed increases and suggests that their techniques scale to much larger song data sets.
