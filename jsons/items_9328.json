Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.

Mitchell  Instructors: Lewis Aron, Anthony Bass, Ken Corbett, Jody Messler Davies, Adrienne Harris       CLINICAL CASE SEMINARS \u2014 THE PSYCHOANALYTIC RELATIONSHIP: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4581)       Case seminars and careful, detailed monitoring of psychoanalytic process over time are among the hallmarks of clinical psychoanalytic education. This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.    Clinical Seminar in Psychoanalytic Process  Instructor: Philip Bromberg    Clinical Case Seminar--Doing the Work: The Experience of Analyst and Patient  Instructor: Barbra Locker         Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Jessica Benjamin     The Analytic Relationship: Case Seminar and Clinical Theory  Instructor: Anthony Bass    The Therapeutic Object Relationship  Instructor: Mark Grunes                Countertransference: A Clinical Seminar  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch  Working at the \"Intimate Edge\"  Instructor: Darlene Ehrenberg  Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Continuous Case Seminar: Problems in Early Integration and the Holding Environment  Instructor: Aaron Thaler  Clinical Case Seminar: How Different Theoretical Approaches Inform the Analyst's Direct Clinical Experience with Patients  Instructor: Warren Wilner The Art of Psychoanalysis: A Clinical Case Seminar on Working (and Playing) with the Unconscious  Instructor: Danielle Knafo Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Muriel Dimen    CLINICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4582)         The psychotherapist and psychoanalyst must learn to tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual patient. One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.

This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.

How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.                Psychoanalysis and Politics  Instructor: Steven Botticelli  More Than Personal: Political and Spiritual Dimensions of the Therapeutic Relationship  Instructor: Andrew Samuels   Race, Racism and Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren  Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: Phenomenological, Spiritual, and Cultural Issues  Instructor: Sara Weber &amp; William Auerbach  Dissociation and Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Foundations of Intersubjectivity: An Introduction to the Philosophy that Grounds Relational Thinking  Instructor: Jack Foehl Psychoanalysis &amp; Religious Narratives: The Christian Narrative  Instructor: Marie Hoffman  Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Studies  Instructors: Steven Botticelli &amp; Katie Gentile  Dissociation &amp; Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Social Identities: Race, Class, Gender &amp; Sexuality  Instructor: Melanie Suchet &amp; Cleonie White  The Politics of Psychoanalysis &amp; the Psychoanalysis of Politics  Instructor: Nancy Hollander        GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4587)       Historically, aspects of psychoanalysis were rooted in 19 th century cultural assumptions about sexuality and gender. Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.                 Autogynephilia, Barebacking, Cisgenderism: Can We Talk (about Gender &amp; Sexuality)?  Instructor: Jack Drescher   Gender and Psychoanalysis: History, Critique, Queering &amp; Complicating (NB: instructor is in the process of updating the readings)  Instructor: Virginia Goldner  Sexuality in Relational Perspective  Instructor: TBA Advanced Seminar on Sexuality in Relational Perspective   Instructor: Muriel Dimen  The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman  Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: Theoretical &amp; Clinical Perspectives  Instructor: Galit Atlas (Koch)       DEVELOPMENTAL &amp; LIFE SPAN ISSUES: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4588)       The genetic and epigenetic (developmental) points of view have long been important to psychoanalysis. Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.               Developmental Perspectives in Psychoanalysis: Infancy through Latency  Instructor: Neal Vorus   Adolescence in Development &amp; Adult Treatment  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren   The Analytic Process &amp; the Process of Development: Emerging Developmental Perspectives &amp; the Actuality of Analytic Work  Instructor: Susan Warshaw Developmental Issues in the Analytic Setting  Instructor: Adrienne Harris Object Loss in Clinical Practice   Instructor: TBA The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality, and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman   Coupling: An Interpersonal Perspective on Adult Development and Intimacy  Instructor: Mary-Joan Gerson   The Developmental Lens and Adult Analytic Work  Instructor: Katherine Oram   Anxiety, Envy, Shame &amp; the Developmental Process  Instructor: Christopher Bonovitz       INFANCY &amp; PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4589)       The past several decades have seen an explosion of research on infancy, and the findings of infancy research have had a significant impact on psychoanalytic theory and practice. Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.
