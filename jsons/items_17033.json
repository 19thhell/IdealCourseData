That is certainly the case for scientists working with so-called \u201csmart\u201d polymers. The more ways in which they can make these chain-like macromolecules shape-shift, phase-shift, self-assemble, disassemble, or secret away smaller molecules, the more they can open doors to practical applications.   Scientists at Polytechnic Institute of New York University\u2019s Protein Engineering and Molecular Design Lab are finding remarkable ways in which bioengineered paired macromolecules called block copolymers can be made to do these kinds of \u201csmart\u201d nano-acrobatics in both directions and then biodegrade when they\u2019ve finished their work.   The key to these macromolecules is their ability to self-assemble when exposed to discrete external stimuli. Self-assembly can occur as a function of temperature or pH, for example. And it is not necessarily a permanent change: It can be reversed.   The lab\u2019s genetically engineered copolymers have applications in everything from artificial therapeutics, biocatalysts, scaffolds and cells for medicine, to sustainable energy and environmental remediation. It is therefore no surprise that New York University\u2019s College of Dentistry and NYU\u2019s Hospital for Joint Diseases are also involved with the NYU-Poly lab in developing new applications including cartilage repair.   It is also no surprise that Polytechnic is the crucible for this work, as early breakthroughs in polymer science happened here under the aegis of Herman Mark, a leading U.S. figure in polymer chemistry and founder of Polytechnic's Polymer Research Institute.   For four years, NYU-Poly Assistant Professor Jin Kim Montclare has been developing block copolymers from scratch using recombinant DNA and putting them through biochemical hoops with a team comprising NYU-Poly students Jennifer Haghpanah, Carlo Yuvienco, Hanna Barra, Peter Baker and Susheel K. Gunasekar; post-doctoral researchers Sachin Khapli and Natalya Voloshchuk; and University of Massachusetts Amherst student Deniz Civay and Professor Murugappan Muthukumar.   The group\u2019s research, published recently in the journal ChemBioChem , involves block copolymers comprising elastin alternating with COMPcc. The former is a pentapeptide whose amino-acid constituents can assemble into a beta spiral structure as a function of temperature, pH or salinity.   COMPcc, which stands for \u201ccartilage oligomeric matrix protein coil coiled,\u201d is a pentamer arranged as five helixes that can contort into an arrangement that produces a hydrophobic core the way one might create a cylindrical cavity by stacking garden hoses on a deck \u2014 thus the odd \u201ccoiled coil\u201d nomenclature. COMPcc has the ability to bind small water-insoluble molecules such as Vitamin D within its hydrophobic core. The possibilities are manifold.   \u201cThat central pore can potentially bind chemicals that are hard to deliver as drugs because they are normally not water soluble,\u201d says Montclare.   For example COMPcc can bind to Vitamin D, a non-dissolving molecule that happens to have profound implications for regenerative tissue and serves as a signaling hormone for the promotion of tissue differentiation into cartilage and bone. And COMPcc can \u201clive\u201d in a copolymer with elastin, synthetics, or other coiled coil-based materials that self-assemble into gels or more organized forms like scaffolding, which can be used for tissue regeneration.   \u201cThe materials that we make form nano-scale self-assembled, biodegradable particles,\u201d says Montclare. \u201cSo you can envision loading them with drugs and delivering them in vivo, or using them as scaffolding for tissue engineering because they are protein-based and therefore suitable for the body without risk of eliciting an immune response.\u201d   Montclare says the advantage of using biological protein-based systems is that one has control over their three-dimensional conformation, the sequences that make up the organic blocks. \u201cSometimes with synthetics you don\u2019t have that,\u201d she says.   Montclare\u2019s team also discovered that the self-assembling behavior of their block copolymers isn\u2019t determined merely by the copolymers\u2019 constituents. It is also a function of the order in which the blocks are arranged within a copolymer, and the number of times a given block appears.   Montclare says that this discovery was a big surprise. \u201cWe were expecting there would be no difference because in synthetic block polymers there isn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cBut with protein-derived macromolecules, we found that directionality controls assembly. ... In our particular case, we can control the temperature-dependent self-assembly by changing the block orientation and number of blocks both on the micro and macro scale.\u201d   Next for the lab, Montclare says, is work controlling the self-assembly of macromolecules by changing the length of each domain.   The work was funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers grant. Additionally, three of the student researchers are funded by an NSF GK12 program.

That is certainly the case for scientists working with so-called \u201csmart\u201d polymers. The more ways in which they can make these chain-like macromolecules shape-shift, phase-shift, self-assemble, disassemble, or secret away smaller molecules, the more they can open doors to practical applications.   Scientists at Polytechnic Institute of New York University\u2019s Protein Engineering and Molecular Design Lab are finding remarkable ways in which bioengineered paired macromolecules called block copolymers can be made to do these kinds of \u201csmart\u201d nano-acrobatics in both directions and then biodegrade when they\u2019ve finished their work.   The key to these macromolecules is their ability to self-assemble when exposed to discrete external stimuli. Self-assembly can occur as a function of temperature or pH, for example. And it is not necessarily a permanent change: It can be reversed.   The lab\u2019s genetically engineered copolymers have applications in everything from artificial therapeutics, biocatalysts, scaffolds and cells for medicine, to sustainable energy and environmental remediation. It is therefore no surprise that New York University\u2019s College of Dentistry and NYU\u2019s Hospital for Joint Diseases are also involved with the NYU-Poly lab in developing new applications including cartilage repair.   It is also no surprise that Polytechnic is the crucible for this work, as early breakthroughs in polymer science happened here under the aegis of Herman Mark, a leading U.S. figure in polymer chemistry and founder of Polytechnic's Polymer Research Institute.   For four years, NYU-Poly Assistant Professor Jin Kim Montclare has been developing block copolymers from scratch using recombinant DNA and putting them through biochemical hoops with a team comprising NYU-Poly students Jennifer Haghpanah, Carlo Yuvienco, Hanna Barra, Peter Baker and Susheel K. Gunasekar; post-doctoral researchers Sachin Khapli and Natalya Voloshchuk; and University of Massachusetts Amherst student Deniz Civay and Professor Murugappan Muthukumar.   The group\u2019s research, published recently in the journal ChemBioChem , involves block copolymers comprising elastin alternating with COMPcc. The former is a pentapeptide whose amino-acid constituents can assemble into a beta spiral structure as a function of temperature, pH or salinity.   COMPcc, which stands for \u201ccartilage oligomeric matrix protein coil coiled,\u201d is a pentamer arranged as five helixes that can contort into an arrangement that produces a hydrophobic core the way one might create a cylindrical cavity by stacking garden hoses on a deck \u2014 thus the odd \u201ccoiled coil\u201d nomenclature. COMPcc has the ability to bind small water-insoluble molecules such as Vitamin D within its hydrophobic core. The possibilities are manifold.   \u201cThat central pore can potentially bind chemicals that are hard to deliver as drugs because they are normally not water soluble,\u201d says Montclare.   For example COMPcc can bind to Vitamin D, a non-dissolving molecule that happens to have profound implications for regenerative tissue and serves as a signaling hormone for the promotion of tissue differentiation into cartilage and bone. And COMPcc can \u201clive\u201d in a copolymer with elastin, synthetics, or other coiled coil-based materials that self-assemble into gels or more organized forms like scaffolding, which can be used for tissue regeneration.   \u201cThe materials that we make form nano-scale self-assembled, biodegradable particles,\u201d says Montclare. \u201cSo you can envision loading them with drugs and delivering them in vivo, or using them as scaffolding for tissue engineering because they are protein-based and therefore suitable for the body without risk of eliciting an immune response.\u201d   Montclare says the advantage of using biological protein-based systems is that one has control over their three-dimensional conformation, the sequences that make up the organic blocks. \u201cSometimes with synthetics you don\u2019t have that,\u201d she says.   Montclare\u2019s team also discovered that the self-assembling behavior of their block copolymers isn\u2019t determined merely by the copolymers\u2019 constituents. It is also a function of the order in which the blocks are arranged within a copolymer, and the number of times a given block appears.   Montclare says that this discovery was a big surprise. \u201cWe were expecting there would be no difference because in synthetic block polymers there isn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cBut with protein-derived macromolecules, we found that directionality controls assembly. ... In our particular case, we can control the temperature-dependent self-assembly by changing the block orientation and number of blocks both on the micro and macro scale.\u201d   Next for the lab, Montclare says, is work controlling the self-assembly of macromolecules by changing the length of each domain.   The work was funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers grant. Additionally, three of the student researchers are funded by an NSF GK12 program.

Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and private industry, the center conducts research to develop new &ldquo;environmentally friendly&rdquo; routes to polymers by using natural systems such as yeasts, fungi, bacteria and plants.   The NSF-BBM is using biocatalytic, or enzyme, reactions to connect small molecules known as monomers to form large molecules known as polymers. Instead of making polymers from potentially hazardous petroleum sources, renewable materials such as sugars and fatty acids are being transformed to make a family of naturally derived plastics. In another example, the center is replacing the use of heavy metal catalysts, which are toxic to the environment, with natural enzyme catalysts to produce high-volume commodity plastics.   The center at Polytechnic is also developing new polyester families that will biodegrade upon disposal and has already created many new polymers by enzyme technology that provide an environmentally safe alternative to conventional chemical routes. The new enzymatic routes are resulting in products that can be used for coatings, adhesives, plastics, thickeners and gels. The new routes to products reduce energy consumption and the release of toxic chemicals during product manufacturing.   Polytechnic University is working collaboratively with biomedical industry leaders and SUNY Downstate Medical Center to develop biocompatible polymers, polymeric drug-delivery systems and advanced therapeutic systems that actively promote wound healing and play a role in other biological processes. Recently, the NSF-BBM developed a new drug for the treatment of sepsis. The researchers&rsquo; findings, which appear in the January 2006 issue of Critical Care Medicine , show that the administration of sophorolipids significantly decreased mortality in animals with intra-abdominal induced sepsis.   Dr. Richard A. Gross, the Herman F. Mark Professor of Polymer Science at Polytechnic and the center&rsquo;s director, notes that the NSF Center for Biocatalysis and Bioprocessing of Macromolecules is creating private industry partnerships for technology development. &ldquo;We believe such university/industry partnerships are critically needed in the United States to boost our competitive position,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;since many private industries have severely reduced their budgets to do exploratory research. In addition, our students gain valuable insights into the realities of industry needs and expectations.&rdquo; Gross was the 2003 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award winner in the academic category for his contributions in environmentally friendly methods for synthesizing polymers.   The NSF-BBM has two programs for private industry participation. The &ldquo;core&rdquo; program consists of cooperative research, whereby companies pool their financial investment in the center to gain access to a larger research program. Companies that have more specific research needs may elect the &ldquo;non-core&rdquo; program, where research is carried out directly between one company and the NSF-BBM center at Polytechnic University.   Chemical and biomedical industry leaders that have partnered with the center include BASF, Rohm &amp; Hass, DNA2.0, Grace Chemical Co., Novozymes, Genencor, Estee Lauder and Johnson &amp; Johnson.   Dr. Paolo Giacomoni, executive director of research for Estee Lauder Companies, says the production of polymers using enzymes is natural and safe. &ldquo;It is the method of choice to prepare polymers for cosmetic products,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;and we look forward with optimism at its application in the very near future.&rdquo;   Another member of the NSF-BBM private industry consortium is the Advanced Biosciences Business of Rohm and Haas Company. &ldquo;We have enjoyed a very direct form of collaboration with Dr. Gross and the laboratory at Polytechnic,&rdquo; says M. Elizabeth Miller, senior scientist, Rohm and Haas Company. &ldquo;Through our collaborative efforts we have learned more about the properties required of polymeric resins for their optimal use as solid supports for immobilized enzymes.&rdquo;      Dr. Kalle Levon, director of Polytechnic&rsquo;s Polymer Research Institute, said: &ldquo;The NSF-BBM is helping Polytechnic move ahead and further develop activities that integrate biology, chemistry and engineering disciplines. The center continues to enhance our national reputation for being in the forefront of polymer science.&rdquo;                                              Galleries                    Mayor Bloomberg engages entrepreneurs in a lively discussion at NYU-Poly&#039;s city-sponsored incubator at 160 Varick St.   View Gallery                         News    Posted May 6th, 2013  Engineers in the Archive  Women&#039;s History Month: Breaking Through the Gender Barriers in Science and Engineering Posted March 20th, 2012  Mayor Bloomberg engages entrepreneurs in a lively discussion at NYU-Poly&#039;s city-sponsored incubator at 160 Varick St. Posted September 1st, 2009  The new poly.edu: a message from Web and Media Services Posted September 1st, 2009        Cable   News from Cable alumni magazine.
