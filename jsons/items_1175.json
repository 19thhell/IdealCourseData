Challenges. Growth.      For NYU to achieve its mission of knowledge creation and distribution, it needs outstanding professionals dedicated to moving the University forward as one of the finest global research institutions in the world and a model of higher education for many years to come. To attract, retain, and motivate these high-quality employees, NYU needs to give them the opportunities and challenges to grow the breadth and depth of their skills at NYU, and be rewarded appropriately for their contributions to NYU\u2019s success.           The compensation structure for Code 100/110 employees.                                    Many higher education institutions are using a type of compensation structure called \u201cBands\u201d to address the expanding need to provide their employees greater opportunities to grow in their career. This way, they can attract and retain first-class employees.     Employees need the flexibility to move across the University to take on new experiences so they can develop their skills. Bands provide this simpler, more flexible structure, which contributes to an environment where personal and career growth can take place without concern over level.   Bands allow you to focus on career growth and developing your skills\u2014in fact, it should be easier to move between jobs so you can take on new challenges and expand your contributions to the University. They also allow for a broader range of options to consider when planning professional growth and skill development.   Read on to learn more about how Bands open a world of opportunities, challenges, and growth for you to achieve your goals at NYU.            Understand How Bands Work   With Bands, jobs are organized into larger groups based on level of responsibility. The jobs in each group share certain key characteristics, including:     \u2022 Scope \u2014the job\u2019s breadth of responsibilities;  \u2022 Reporting relationship \u2014the level of management that the job reports to;  \u2022 Required skills \u2014the job\u2019s complexity, degree of specialization, and the necessary education or equivalent experience; and  \u2022 Accountability and institutional impact \u2014the degree to which this job bears ultimate responsibility.   While jobs within a band are related across these key characteristics, there are varying degrees of scope and accountability within each band, which creates multiple levels. This allows a more flexible framework for making decisions about employees\u2019 career growth, job movement and skills development within a band.            The Advantages of Bands     Here\u2019s a look at some of the advantages of Bands:   \u2022 Foster Greater Cross-Functional Mobility.     Within each band, jobs from any number of different functions are grouped together. When a job is posted, it may be from any of these different functions. Without grades, you\u2019re less likely to focus on just the handful of jobs within your function that represent a grade increase. Instead, you can focus on the many more jobs (from any function) that build new skills or expose you to different areas of the business.     \u2022 Promote Personal Growth and Broad-Based Career Development.     This new approach exposes you to jobs that enable you to acquire new and different skills. That type of growth in skills and responsibilities places the emphasis on broad-based personal growth, rather than vertical job movement (grade-to-grade increases).     \u2022 Facilitate Team-Building.     With the more flexible structure that Bands provides, hierarchical barriers to teamwork are eliminated. The new structure allows for greater collaboration among peers on a variety of teams.     \u2022 Focus Attention on Increases in Responsibility.     Level of responsibility is an important element in Bands. It influences Scope, Reporting Relationship and Accountability, which are all key factors in determining how a job is banded. So in your career development, you\u2019re likely to focus on aspects of your current job (and potential new jobs) that increase your level of responsibility.     \u2022 Reduce Layers and Support a More Transparent Organization.     Our old grade structure was right for its time. But in today\u2019s environment, grades can function as barriers that don\u2019t allow us to achieve our organizational objectives\u2014like the need for people to have a greater breadth of knowledge of our Global Network University, and to move between assignments and across job functions, whether in New York City or across the globe.            Take a Look at the Bands   Our compensation structure consists of six bands for Administrative and Professional employees. Here\u2019s a look at the Band structure and the broad roles that fall into each band.         Band   Role*     56   Officer, Associate Provost, Dean, VP, SVP    55 Director, Senior Director, Assistant/Associate Vice President, Assistant/Associate Dean  54 Senior Administrative and Professional/First-Level Manager  53 Mid-Level Administrative and Professional/First-Level Manager  52 Entry to Experienced Administrative and Professional First-Level Supervisor  51 Senior Non-Exempt/Non-Union Positions       *Please note that while the titles above are meant to provide a general representation of the types of titles found at a given band level, title differences may exist across regions and specific global locations.              NYU's Approach to Pay   Each band has associated market rates based on job family or functional discipline\u2014e.g., finance, technology. The scope and range of jobs in each band is so wide that setting salary ranges would offer no benefit. Instead of salary ranges, competitive market rates, which are much more accurate references for the value of a job, are used for individual positions. That means:   \u2022 The highest pay level in a band may be twice as high as the lowest pay level for that same band. So people in the same band may be paid differently based on the level and scope of responsibility of their specific job, as well as their own experience and performance...                               \u2022 Market ranges from one band can overlap with another band. So a person in a lower band could be earning more than a person whose position is in a higher band...                               \u2022 Two people in different types of jobs may be earning the same amount, even though they\u2019re in different bands...                               Your pay level within the band is primarily determined by the market value of that particular job, plus your experience and performance. Pay is continually reviewed through external market studies, which take into consideration geography, cost of labor and university peer institutions.          Note: The salary levels shown in the bands above are for illustrative purposes only and may not correspond with the actual bands.              Career Progression   With Bands, there are three types of career progression:         Type of Career Progression Description   Band-to-Band Promotion Movement to a different job in a higher band  Within Band Growth Movement to a different job in the same band  Role Enhancement Adding significantly more responsibility within the same role      For example, assume you\u2019re a Budget Analyst in Band 52:   \u2022 A band-to-band promotion may be advancement to a Budget Manager in Band 53.  \u2022 Within band growth may be a move to a Finance Communication Manager in the same Band 52.  \u2022 Role enhancement may be advancement to a Budget Analyst II in the same Band 52.   Bands allow you to focus on meaningful ways of tracking your career development. Specifically, developing expertise and building experience through a variety of assignments\u2014in addition to your overall performance and contribution to NYU\u2014will determine the progress you make in your career. You\u2019ll have opportunities to develop your skills, which may result in both lateral and hierarchical career growth.            Take a Closer Look At\u2026   Band-to-Band Promotions   Band-to-band promotions to new jobs in a different band represent a significant step in career growth. Since each band differs in its scope, reporting relationships, required skills, and accountability, when you move from one band to another, that move represents a significant promotion\u2014and a significant increase in the contribution you can make to NYU.   Within Band Growth and Role Enhancement   Bands allow for greater growth within each band. You may progress through several jobs\u2014and receive pay increases\u2014within the same band. You and your manager may even be in the same band. Job changes may be lateral or across functions, depending on business needs and your career interests. Under the Band structure, the focus is on broad-based growth and development, which can happen by moving on to new functions or new jobs\u2014even within the same band.                                                                     Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            Do other universities have Bands?                                                       Yes. A number of other peer universities\u2014including Bucknell, Cornell, Duke, Fordham, Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, Princeton, Syracuse, UPENN, Villanova, Wake Forest and Yale\u2014have implemented similar approaches. While Bands are also known as \u201cBroadbands\u201d or \u201cCareer Bands,\u201d the basic principles are the same: to simplify the job value structure, align it with a flatter organization, and reduce barriers between jobs so you can grow in your career.                                                                                                                                                                          How do Bands help NYU achieve its goals?                                                       Bands give both NYU and individual employees more flexibility. When a business need is identified, NYU is able to respond to it quickly. This approach also makes career development a more open topic. In fact, individual development continues to be a strong focus of ours as we meet the demands of the Global Network University expansion. After all, when individuals grow, they make larger contributions to the University. Our future success depends on the teamwork of individual contributors.                                                                                                                                                                          What\u2019s in it for me?                                                       Bands help you focus on professional growth and allow you to develop to your fuller potential, while strongly tying your pay to your performance, your span of responsibilities and your contribution to the University\u2019s success.                                                                                                                                                                          How do Bands affect the job posting system? Can I apply for another position in my Band?                                                       The job posting system identifies the job title, desired qualifications, band name and a brief description of job responsibilities. Under Bands, employees can\u2014and should be encouraged to\u2014apply for positions within their same band.                                                                                                                                                                          How will my pay be determined under Bands?                                                       Your manager, in partnership with your Human Resources Officer and Compensation, will recommend an appropriate level of pay for you based on several factors, including:     Your job performance;   External market data;   Actual job responsibilities;   Individual skills, knowledge, and experience; and   Internal pay for similar positions.     All of the above factors are ultimately subject to the University's ability to pay.                                                                                                                                                                          Do Bands reduce my advancement opportunities?                                                        No. Your opportunities to assume more challenging work will increase within each band. Remember, under Bands, you can broaden your experience and thereby increase your pay without concern over whether a band change will occur. So the opportunities to expand your current job and broaden your experience with other positions will increase.                                                                                                                                                                          What incentive is there to move within the same Band?                                                       The jobs within the same band that you would most likely consider are those that add to your job skills and have the potential to add to your career advancement. Within Bands, the focus is on broad-based career development, rather than upward progression in a narrow area.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be penalized under Bands if I choose to remain in one function, rather than move cross-functionally?                                                       No. Bands are designed to reward employees who broaden their experience and knowledgebase, whether it\u2019s in one function or cross-functionally. In fact, employees who want to develop their skills within a function should find that Bands allow them to do so with less concern over grade movement.                                                                                                                                                                          How will Bands help my career?                                                       Bands provide you more flexibility and support if you want developmental experiences that maximize your abilities and strengths, and assist you in advancing your career.                                                                                                                                                                          Is a promotion more important when it results in a change in Band?                                                       Moves from one Band to another will recognize significant new levels of expertise and experience, accompanied by a substantial change in the ability to operate independently or to manage the work of others. However, all promotions should enhance personal growth, meet career objectives and contribute to the success of the business.                                                                                            Glossary                                           Accountability                               The degree to which a particular job bears ultimate responsibility\u2014either for work results or for the performance of others. Accountability is one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                                Bands                               A structure that places each NYU job within one of six groups. The jobs in each group share certain key characteristics. Bands are a simplified job structure that supports a flatter organization and reduces barriers between functions and people. NYU Bands range from 51 to 56.                                                                Band-to-Band Promotion                               Events in which you take on a new job that provides the opportunity to make greater contributions to the University\u2019s success. In Bands, a promotion can occur when you move from a job in one band into a job in a higher-level band.                                                                Career Development                               An individual\u2019s growth\u2014whether it\u2019s in terms of skills, experience, knowledge, or other attributes\u2014which leads to greater professional opportunities.                                                                Career Mobility                               Movement from one function to another within the organization. Career mobility can help you gain the type of experience, skills, or knowledge to progress in your career. The movement can be cross-functional (from one area of the business to another), or it can be to another job in the same area where new experience, skills, or knowledge can be gained.                                                                Development Opportunity                               An ongoing process of developing the skills, knowledge and overall ability to make greater contributions to the University\u2019s success. Continued development assists you in your efforts to advance your career by providing opportunities to take on roles with greater responsibility. Bands support personal growth because they make it easier for you to consider jobs that would build (or strengthen) a broad base of skills and knowledge.                                                                Functional Discipline                               Refers to specific job function and related content expertise (e.g., technology, marketing, human resources, development).                                                                Job Evaluation                               The process through which a position is analyzed by Compensation to determine the most appropriate band.                                                               Job Family/Function                               A grouping of the major functions across the University. Job families form the basis for determining market reference ranges and setting the value for a given position. There are 16 job families, including:                     Code Job Family   A Business/Professional Administrative  C Non-Exempt Sciences Support  D Academic Program Support  F Finance/Real Estate/Procurement/Grant Management  G General Office Administration  H Health Services  I Campus/Auxiliary/Transportation, Facilities, Public Safety  K Development/Sponsored Research/Grant Writing  L Libraries  M Marketing, Advertising, Public Relations, Media, Video, Audio  O Other Non-Exempt Support, N.E.C.  R Human Resources  T Technology  W Engineering  Z Student Services/Athletics                                                Job Scope                               The breadth and depth of responsibilities associated with a given position in the University. Job scope is one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                               Layers (Flatter Organization Concept)                               The levels within an organization that place employees into a hierarchy. This hierarchy influences reporting relationships, teamwork, lines of communication, and almost every other aspect of the way the University\u2019s employees work with one another.                                                                Market Competitiveness                               Guidelines that set the University\u2019s pay levels in line with what similar institutions pay for similar jobs. Market competitiveness relates to one of NYU\u2019s compensation principles.                                                               Market Pricing                               The process through which the University analyzes pay for similar positions within peer organizations.                                                               Required Skills                               The complexity of a particular job and the degree of specialization that the person in the job must be able to demonstrate in day-to-day work. Required skills are one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                              Skill-Building                               The process through which employees either acquire new competencies or strengthen existing ones. Skill-building is one of the most effective ways for employees to further their careers, because a broader base of skills puts employees in a position to take on a broader range of job openings. Bands support skill-building because they encourage employees to consider new jobs that would help them develop a broader range of skills.

Challenges. Growth.      For NYU to achieve its mission of knowledge creation and distribution, it needs outstanding professionals dedicated to moving the University forward as one of the finest global research institutions in the world and a model of higher education for many years to come. To attract, retain, and motivate these high-quality employees, NYU needs to give them the opportunities and challenges to grow the breadth and depth of their skills at NYU, and be rewarded appropriately for their contributions to NYU\u2019s success.           The compensation structure for Code 100/110 employees.                                    Many higher education institutions are using a type of compensation structure called \u201cBands\u201d to address the expanding need to provide their employees greater opportunities to grow in their career. This way, they can attract and retain first-class employees.     Employees need the flexibility to move across the University to take on new experiences so they can develop their skills. Bands provide this simpler, more flexible structure, which contributes to an environment where personal and career growth can take place without concern over level.   Bands allow you to focus on career growth and developing your skills\u2014in fact, it should be easier to move between jobs so you can take on new challenges and expand your contributions to the University. They also allow for a broader range of options to consider when planning professional growth and skill development.   Read on to learn more about how Bands open a world of opportunities, challenges, and growth for you to achieve your goals at NYU.            Understand How Bands Work   With Bands, jobs are organized into larger groups based on level of responsibility. The jobs in each group share certain key characteristics, including:     \u2022 Scope \u2014the job\u2019s breadth of responsibilities;  \u2022 Reporting relationship \u2014the level of management that the job reports to;  \u2022 Required skills \u2014the job\u2019s complexity, degree of specialization, and the necessary education or equivalent experience; and  \u2022 Accountability and institutional impact \u2014the degree to which this job bears ultimate responsibility.   While jobs within a band are related across these key characteristics, there are varying degrees of scope and accountability within each band, which creates multiple levels. This allows a more flexible framework for making decisions about employees\u2019 career growth, job movement and skills development within a band.            The Advantages of Bands     Here\u2019s a look at some of the advantages of Bands:   \u2022 Foster Greater Cross-Functional Mobility.     Within each band, jobs from any number of different functions are grouped together. When a job is posted, it may be from any of these different functions. Without grades, you\u2019re less likely to focus on just the handful of jobs within your function that represent a grade increase. Instead, you can focus on the many more jobs (from any function) that build new skills or expose you to different areas of the business.     \u2022 Promote Personal Growth and Broad-Based Career Development.     This new approach exposes you to jobs that enable you to acquire new and different skills. That type of growth in skills and responsibilities places the emphasis on broad-based personal growth, rather than vertical job movement (grade-to-grade increases).     \u2022 Facilitate Team-Building.     With the more flexible structure that Bands provides, hierarchical barriers to teamwork are eliminated. The new structure allows for greater collaboration among peers on a variety of teams.     \u2022 Focus Attention on Increases in Responsibility.     Level of responsibility is an important element in Bands. It influences Scope, Reporting Relationship and Accountability, which are all key factors in determining how a job is banded. So in your career development, you\u2019re likely to focus on aspects of your current job (and potential new jobs) that increase your level of responsibility.     \u2022 Reduce Layers and Support a More Transparent Organization.     Our old grade structure was right for its time. But in today\u2019s environment, grades can function as barriers that don\u2019t allow us to achieve our organizational objectives\u2014like the need for people to have a greater breadth of knowledge of our Global Network University, and to move between assignments and across job functions, whether in New York City or across the globe.            Take a Look at the Bands   Our compensation structure consists of six bands for Administrative and Professional employees. Here\u2019s a look at the Band structure and the broad roles that fall into each band.         Band   Role*     56   Officer, Associate Provost, Dean, VP, SVP    55 Director, Senior Director, Assistant/Associate Vice President, Assistant/Associate Dean  54 Senior Administrative and Professional/First-Level Manager  53 Mid-Level Administrative and Professional/First-Level Manager  52 Entry to Experienced Administrative and Professional First-Level Supervisor  51 Senior Non-Exempt/Non-Union Positions       *Please note that while the titles above are meant to provide a general representation of the types of titles found at a given band level, title differences may exist across regions and specific global locations.              NYU's Approach to Pay   Each band has associated market rates based on job family or functional discipline\u2014e.g., finance, technology. The scope and range of jobs in each band is so wide that setting salary ranges would offer no benefit. Instead of salary ranges, competitive market rates, which are much more accurate references for the value of a job, are used for individual positions. That means:   \u2022 The highest pay level in a band may be twice as high as the lowest pay level for that same band. So people in the same band may be paid differently based on the level and scope of responsibility of their specific job, as well as their own experience and performance...                               \u2022 Market ranges from one band can overlap with another band. So a person in a lower band could be earning more than a person whose position is in a higher band...                               \u2022 Two people in different types of jobs may be earning the same amount, even though they\u2019re in different bands...                               Your pay level within the band is primarily determined by the market value of that particular job, plus your experience and performance. Pay is continually reviewed through external market studies, which take into consideration geography, cost of labor and university peer institutions.          Note: The salary levels shown in the bands above are for illustrative purposes only and may not correspond with the actual bands.              Career Progression   With Bands, there are three types of career progression:         Type of Career Progression Description   Band-to-Band Promotion Movement to a different job in a higher band  Within Band Growth Movement to a different job in the same band  Role Enhancement Adding significantly more responsibility within the same role      For example, assume you\u2019re a Budget Analyst in Band 52:   \u2022 A band-to-band promotion may be advancement to a Budget Manager in Band 53.  \u2022 Within band growth may be a move to a Finance Communication Manager in the same Band 52.  \u2022 Role enhancement may be advancement to a Budget Analyst II in the same Band 52.   Bands allow you to focus on meaningful ways of tracking your career development. Specifically, developing expertise and building experience through a variety of assignments\u2014in addition to your overall performance and contribution to NYU\u2014will determine the progress you make in your career. You\u2019ll have opportunities to develop your skills, which may result in both lateral and hierarchical career growth.            Take a Closer Look At\u2026   Band-to-Band Promotions   Band-to-band promotions to new jobs in a different band represent a significant step in career growth. Since each band differs in its scope, reporting relationships, required skills, and accountability, when you move from one band to another, that move represents a significant promotion\u2014and a significant increase in the contribution you can make to NYU.   Within Band Growth and Role Enhancement   Bands allow for greater growth within each band. You may progress through several jobs\u2014and receive pay increases\u2014within the same band. You and your manager may even be in the same band. Job changes may be lateral or across functions, depending on business needs and your career interests. Under the Band structure, the focus is on broad-based growth and development, which can happen by moving on to new functions or new jobs\u2014even within the same band.                                                                     Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            Do other universities have Bands?                                                       Yes. A number of other peer universities\u2014including Bucknell, Cornell, Duke, Fordham, Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, Princeton, Syracuse, UPENN, Villanova, Wake Forest and Yale\u2014have implemented similar approaches. While Bands are also known as \u201cBroadbands\u201d or \u201cCareer Bands,\u201d the basic principles are the same: to simplify the job value structure, align it with a flatter organization, and reduce barriers between jobs so you can grow in your career.                                                                                                                                                                          How do Bands help NYU achieve its goals?                                                       Bands give both NYU and individual employees more flexibility. When a business need is identified, NYU is able to respond to it quickly. This approach also makes career development a more open topic. In fact, individual development continues to be a strong focus of ours as we meet the demands of the Global Network University expansion. After all, when individuals grow, they make larger contributions to the University. Our future success depends on the teamwork of individual contributors.                                                                                                                                                                          What\u2019s in it for me?                                                       Bands help you focus on professional growth and allow you to develop to your fuller potential, while strongly tying your pay to your performance, your span of responsibilities and your contribution to the University\u2019s success.                                                                                                                                                                          How do Bands affect the job posting system? Can I apply for another position in my Band?                                                       The job posting system identifies the job title, desired qualifications, band name and a brief description of job responsibilities. Under Bands, employees can\u2014and should be encouraged to\u2014apply for positions within their same band.                                                                                                                                                                          How will my pay be determined under Bands?                                                       Your manager, in partnership with your Human Resources Officer and Compensation, will recommend an appropriate level of pay for you based on several factors, including:     Your job performance;   External market data;   Actual job responsibilities;   Individual skills, knowledge, and experience; and   Internal pay for similar positions.     All of the above factors are ultimately subject to the University's ability to pay.                                                                                                                                                                          Do Bands reduce my advancement opportunities?                                                        No. Your opportunities to assume more challenging work will increase within each band. Remember, under Bands, you can broaden your experience and thereby increase your pay without concern over whether a band change will occur. So the opportunities to expand your current job and broaden your experience with other positions will increase.                                                                                                                                                                          What incentive is there to move within the same Band?                                                       The jobs within the same band that you would most likely consider are those that add to your job skills and have the potential to add to your career advancement. Within Bands, the focus is on broad-based career development, rather than upward progression in a narrow area.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be penalized under Bands if I choose to remain in one function, rather than move cross-functionally?                                                       No. Bands are designed to reward employees who broaden their experience and knowledgebase, whether it\u2019s in one function or cross-functionally. In fact, employees who want to develop their skills within a function should find that Bands allow them to do so with less concern over grade movement.                                                                                                                                                                          How will Bands help my career?                                                       Bands provide you more flexibility and support if you want developmental experiences that maximize your abilities and strengths, and assist you in advancing your career.                                                                                                                                                                          Is a promotion more important when it results in a change in Band?                                                       Moves from one Band to another will recognize significant new levels of expertise and experience, accompanied by a substantial change in the ability to operate independently or to manage the work of others. However, all promotions should enhance personal growth, meet career objectives and contribute to the success of the business.                                                                                            Glossary                                           Accountability                               The degree to which a particular job bears ultimate responsibility\u2014either for work results or for the performance of others. Accountability is one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                                Bands                               A structure that places each NYU job within one of six groups. The jobs in each group share certain key characteristics. Bands are a simplified job structure that supports a flatter organization and reduces barriers between functions and people. NYU Bands range from 51 to 56.                                                                Band-to-Band Promotion                               Events in which you take on a new job that provides the opportunity to make greater contributions to the University\u2019s success. In Bands, a promotion can occur when you move from a job in one band into a job in a higher-level band.                                                                Career Development                               An individual\u2019s growth\u2014whether it\u2019s in terms of skills, experience, knowledge, or other attributes\u2014which leads to greater professional opportunities.                                                                Career Mobility                               Movement from one function to another within the organization. Career mobility can help you gain the type of experience, skills, or knowledge to progress in your career. The movement can be cross-functional (from one area of the business to another), or it can be to another job in the same area where new experience, skills, or knowledge can be gained.                                                                Development Opportunity                               An ongoing process of developing the skills, knowledge and overall ability to make greater contributions to the University\u2019s success. Continued development assists you in your efforts to advance your career by providing opportunities to take on roles with greater responsibility. Bands support personal growth because they make it easier for you to consider jobs that would build (or strengthen) a broad base of skills and knowledge.                                                                Functional Discipline                               Refers to specific job function and related content expertise (e.g., technology, marketing, human resources, development).                                                                Job Evaluation                               The process through which a position is analyzed by Compensation to determine the most appropriate band.                                                               Job Family/Function                               A grouping of the major functions across the University. Job families form the basis for determining market reference ranges and setting the value for a given position. There are 16 job families, including:                     Code Job Family   A Business/Professional Administrative  C Non-Exempt Sciences Support  D Academic Program Support  F Finance/Real Estate/Procurement/Grant Management  G General Office Administration  H Health Services  I Campus/Auxiliary/Transportation, Facilities, Public Safety  K Development/Sponsored Research/Grant Writing  L Libraries  M Marketing, Advertising, Public Relations, Media, Video, Audio  O Other Non-Exempt Support, N.E.C.  R Human Resources  T Technology  W Engineering  Z Student Services/Athletics                                                Job Scope                               The breadth and depth of responsibilities associated with a given position in the University. Job scope is one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                               Layers (Flatter Organization Concept)                               The levels within an organization that place employees into a hierarchy. This hierarchy influences reporting relationships, teamwork, lines of communication, and almost every other aspect of the way the University\u2019s employees work with one another.                                                                Market Competitiveness                               Guidelines that set the University\u2019s pay levels in line with what similar institutions pay for similar jobs. Market competitiveness relates to one of NYU\u2019s compensation principles.                                                               Market Pricing                               The process through which the University analyzes pay for similar positions within peer organizations.                                                               Required Skills                               The complexity of a particular job and the degree of specialization that the person in the job must be able to demonstrate in day-to-day work. Required skills are one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                              Skill-Building                               The process through which employees either acquire new competencies or strengthen existing ones. Skill-building is one of the most effective ways for employees to further their careers, because a broader base of skills puts employees in a position to take on a broader range of job openings. Bands support skill-building because they encourage employees to consider new jobs that would help them develop a broader range of skills.

Video recording and comprehensive documentation of every session is standard practice, and provides trainees with a modality for supervision and self-evaluation. The Center offers an advanced training program leading to certification as a Level 1 Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapist (NRMT). Trainees conduct sessions in group and individual music therapy, have weekly individual supervision and attend special classes in improvisation, clinical theory, and group music therapy. In addition to the Center&#39;s core courses, they also participate in Certification Seminar and Clinical Improvisation Workshop. The training course runs from approximately September 1 to June 30 each year.  Eligibility: This training is only open to those music therapists with a Masters degree in music therapy or who possess an undergraduate degree in music therapy and are undertaking this training concomitant to enrollment in a music therapy Masters program. It is essential that certification candidates have prior clinical experience. In some cases a successful music therapy internship may qualify. Certification candidates are expected to have already utilized improvisation in their clinical work. The interview-audition at this level serves to assess a candidate&#39;s capacity to fulfill the requirements of advanced training. In some instances it may be necessary to assign a candidate supplemental course work within the NYU music therapy masters program. Please note: The length of the training is typically one year but the need for continuing supervision may require clinical practice at the Center to be extended further in order to attain certification standards. Training Course Components: I. Clinical Practice Candidates will participate in the following clinical and related activities: individual and group music therapy with experiences as primary therapist and co-therapist; video/audio documentation (indexing) and analysis of therapy sessions; conferences with parents of child clients; communication with professionals involved in clients&#39; treatment; report writing; development of video technique in filming and producing clinical oriented video recordings of therapy sessions; compilation of video excerpts and/or research studies of music therapy processes; presentation of one case study of individual therapy including video examples and spoken commentary. II. Supervision Candidates have a clinical supervisor with whom they meet for a minimum of one hour of individual supervision each week. At times, the trainee and supervisor will conduct clinical work as a team. Supervision is used to facilitate the candidate&#39;s integration of the various experiences in Nordoff-Robbins coursework and clinical work. Support is offered in a variety of areas: musical skill-building and enhanced listening ability through review of audio/video recordings; addressing clinical issues emerging from sessions; and, processing personal reactions and their emergence in music. III. Coursework Our training program is unique in its comprehensive focus on the clinical application of music, and the development of musical resources. In addition to clinical work, there are instructional classes, which meet weekly. There are 5 classes offered in the course:  Clinical Improvisation Clinical Musicianship Practice and Theory of Group Music Therapy  Certification Seminar  Clinical Improvisation Workshop  Interns take the first three classes. Certification candidates take all five courses. These courses run throughout the training. Supervised clinical practice takes place concurrently. Readings will be assigned throughout the training.  Clinical Musicianship offers lectures that articulate the philosophical foundations of this work and illuminate empirically the process of music therapy through detailed analysis of individual therapy case presentations. Whenever possible, ideas from the lectures are worked on practically on piano or guitar.  Clinical Improvisation focuses on developing musical resources and practical skills, studying various musical styles, idioms and forms. Goals include increasing responsiveness and learning to improvise with a sense of compositional form and clinical intention. Individual reactions to music, as well as students&#39; personal musical styles, will be explored.  Certification Seminar provides participants with an opportunity to share excerpts of their ongoing work and receive practical feedback on their clinical-musical interventions. It will also be a place to follow up in more depth on some of the philosophical foundations addressed in the class on Clinical Musicianship.  Practice and Theory of Group Music Therapy covers a variety of topics through practice and direct application: Clinical considerations including goals, stages of development of the individual &amp; group, the place of improvisation and composition in group process; leadership styles; Techniques involved in improvising songs and developing instrumental improvisations; Techniques involved in both leading and playing composed or arranged songs and instrumental pieces; Composing vocal and instrumental pieces based on the needs of specific clients; Selection,care and use of a large number of specially-designed and general instruments. Trainees will have the opportunity to present original material in class. In addition, students are encouraged to bring in videotape excerpts of on-going group music therapy for discussion and feedback.  Clinical Improvisation Workshop provides a forum to explore and further develop musical resources for specific clinical situations. The focus is on practical, clinical techniques and role-playing specific situations that arise in trainees&#39; clinical practice. Discussions regarding aspects of the Nordoff-Robbins approach as well as any relevant clinical/musical issues the group wishes to examine are welcomed.

Challenges. Growth.      For NYU to achieve its mission of knowledge creation and distribution, it needs outstanding professionals dedicated to moving the University forward as one of the finest global research institutions in the world and a model of higher education for many years to come. To attract, retain, and motivate these high-quality employees, NYU needs to give them the opportunities and challenges to grow the breadth and depth of their skills at NYU, and be rewarded appropriately for their contributions to NYU\u2019s success.           The compensation structure for Code 100/110 employees.                                    Many higher education institutions are using a type of compensation structure called \u201cBands\u201d to address the expanding need to provide their employees greater opportunities to grow in their career. This way, they can attract and retain first-class employees.     Employees need the flexibility to move across the University to take on new experiences so they can develop their skills. Bands provide this simpler, more flexible structure, which contributes to an environment where personal and career growth can take place without concern over level.   Bands allow you to focus on career growth and developing your skills\u2014in fact, it should be easier to move between jobs so you can take on new challenges and expand your contributions to the University. They also allow for a broader range of options to consider when planning professional growth and skill development.   Read on to learn more about how Bands open a world of opportunities, challenges, and growth for you to achieve your goals at NYU.            Understand How Bands Work   With Bands, jobs are organized into larger groups based on level of responsibility. The jobs in each group share certain key characteristics, including:     \u2022 Scope \u2014the job\u2019s breadth of responsibilities;  \u2022 Reporting relationship \u2014the level of management that the job reports to;  \u2022 Required skills \u2014the job\u2019s complexity, degree of specialization, and the necessary education or equivalent experience; and  \u2022 Accountability and institutional impact \u2014the degree to which this job bears ultimate responsibility.   While jobs within a band are related across these key characteristics, there are varying degrees of scope and accountability within each band, which creates multiple levels. This allows a more flexible framework for making decisions about employees\u2019 career growth, job movement and skills development within a band.            The Advantages of Bands     Here\u2019s a look at some of the advantages of Bands:   \u2022 Foster Greater Cross-Functional Mobility.     Within each band, jobs from any number of different functions are grouped together. When a job is posted, it may be from any of these different functions. Without grades, you\u2019re less likely to focus on just the handful of jobs within your function that represent a grade increase. Instead, you can focus on the many more jobs (from any function) that build new skills or expose you to different areas of the business.     \u2022 Promote Personal Growth and Broad-Based Career Development.     This new approach exposes you to jobs that enable you to acquire new and different skills. That type of growth in skills and responsibilities places the emphasis on broad-based personal growth, rather than vertical job movement (grade-to-grade increases).     \u2022 Facilitate Team-Building.     With the more flexible structure that Bands provides, hierarchical barriers to teamwork are eliminated. The new structure allows for greater collaboration among peers on a variety of teams.     \u2022 Focus Attention on Increases in Responsibility.     Level of responsibility is an important element in Bands. It influences Scope, Reporting Relationship and Accountability, which are all key factors in determining how a job is banded. So in your career development, you\u2019re likely to focus on aspects of your current job (and potential new jobs) that increase your level of responsibility.     \u2022 Reduce Layers and Support a More Transparent Organization.     Our old grade structure was right for its time. But in today\u2019s environment, grades can function as barriers that don\u2019t allow us to achieve our organizational objectives\u2014like the need for people to have a greater breadth of knowledge of our Global Network University, and to move between assignments and across job functions, whether in New York City or across the globe.            Take a Look at the Bands   Our compensation structure consists of six bands for Administrative and Professional employees. Here\u2019s a look at the Band structure and the broad roles that fall into each band.         Band   Role*     56   Officer, Associate Provost, Dean, VP, SVP    55 Director, Senior Director, Assistant/Associate Vice President, Assistant/Associate Dean  54 Senior Administrative and Professional/First-Level Manager  53 Mid-Level Administrative and Professional/First-Level Manager  52 Entry to Experienced Administrative and Professional First-Level Supervisor  51 Senior Non-Exempt/Non-Union Positions       *Please note that while the titles above are meant to provide a general representation of the types of titles found at a given band level, title differences may exist across regions and specific global locations.              NYU's Approach to Pay   Each band has associated market rates based on job family or functional discipline\u2014e.g., finance, technology. The scope and range of jobs in each band is so wide that setting salary ranges would offer no benefit. Instead of salary ranges, competitive market rates, which are much more accurate references for the value of a job, are used for individual positions. That means:   \u2022 The highest pay level in a band may be twice as high as the lowest pay level for that same band. So people in the same band may be paid differently based on the level and scope of responsibility of their specific job, as well as their own experience and performance...                               \u2022 Market ranges from one band can overlap with another band. So a person in a lower band could be earning more than a person whose position is in a higher band...                               \u2022 Two people in different types of jobs may be earning the same amount, even though they\u2019re in different bands...                               Your pay level within the band is primarily determined by the market value of that particular job, plus your experience and performance. Pay is continually reviewed through external market studies, which take into consideration geography, cost of labor and university peer institutions.          Note: The salary levels shown in the bands above are for illustrative purposes only and may not correspond with the actual bands.              Career Progression   With Bands, there are three types of career progression:         Type of Career Progression Description   Band-to-Band Promotion Movement to a different job in a higher band  Within Band Growth Movement to a different job in the same band  Role Enhancement Adding significantly more responsibility within the same role      For example, assume you\u2019re a Budget Analyst in Band 52:   \u2022 A band-to-band promotion may be advancement to a Budget Manager in Band 53.  \u2022 Within band growth may be a move to a Finance Communication Manager in the same Band 52.  \u2022 Role enhancement may be advancement to a Budget Analyst II in the same Band 52.   Bands allow you to focus on meaningful ways of tracking your career development. Specifically, developing expertise and building experience through a variety of assignments\u2014in addition to your overall performance and contribution to NYU\u2014will determine the progress you make in your career. You\u2019ll have opportunities to develop your skills, which may result in both lateral and hierarchical career growth.            Take a Closer Look At\u2026   Band-to-Band Promotions   Band-to-band promotions to new jobs in a different band represent a significant step in career growth. Since each band differs in its scope, reporting relationships, required skills, and accountability, when you move from one band to another, that move represents a significant promotion\u2014and a significant increase in the contribution you can make to NYU.   Within Band Growth and Role Enhancement   Bands allow for greater growth within each band. You may progress through several jobs\u2014and receive pay increases\u2014within the same band. You and your manager may even be in the same band. Job changes may be lateral or across functions, depending on business needs and your career interests. Under the Band structure, the focus is on broad-based growth and development, which can happen by moving on to new functions or new jobs\u2014even within the same band.                                                                     Frequently Asked Questions                                                                                                                            Do other universities have Bands?                                                       Yes. A number of other peer universities\u2014including Bucknell, Cornell, Duke, Fordham, Johns Hopkins, Northeastern, Princeton, Syracuse, UPENN, Villanova, Wake Forest and Yale\u2014have implemented similar approaches. While Bands are also known as \u201cBroadbands\u201d or \u201cCareer Bands,\u201d the basic principles are the same: to simplify the job value structure, align it with a flatter organization, and reduce barriers between jobs so you can grow in your career.                                                                                                                                                                          How do Bands help NYU achieve its goals?                                                       Bands give both NYU and individual employees more flexibility. When a business need is identified, NYU is able to respond to it quickly. This approach also makes career development a more open topic. In fact, individual development continues to be a strong focus of ours as we meet the demands of the Global Network University expansion. After all, when individuals grow, they make larger contributions to the University. Our future success depends on the teamwork of individual contributors.                                                                                                                                                                          What\u2019s in it for me?                                                       Bands help you focus on professional growth and allow you to develop to your fuller potential, while strongly tying your pay to your performance, your span of responsibilities and your contribution to the University\u2019s success.                                                                                                                                                                          How do Bands affect the job posting system? Can I apply for another position in my Band?                                                       The job posting system identifies the job title, desired qualifications, band name and a brief description of job responsibilities. Under Bands, employees can\u2014and should be encouraged to\u2014apply for positions within their same band.                                                                                                                                                                          How will my pay be determined under Bands?                                                       Your manager, in partnership with your Human Resources Officer and Compensation, will recommend an appropriate level of pay for you based on several factors, including:     Your job performance;   External market data;   Actual job responsibilities;   Individual skills, knowledge, and experience; and   Internal pay for similar positions.     All of the above factors are ultimately subject to the University's ability to pay.                                                                                                                                                                          Do Bands reduce my advancement opportunities?                                                        No. Your opportunities to assume more challenging work will increase within each band. Remember, under Bands, you can broaden your experience and thereby increase your pay without concern over whether a band change will occur. So the opportunities to expand your current job and broaden your experience with other positions will increase.                                                                                                                                                                          What incentive is there to move within the same Band?                                                       The jobs within the same band that you would most likely consider are those that add to your job skills and have the potential to add to your career advancement. Within Bands, the focus is on broad-based career development, rather than upward progression in a narrow area.                                                                                                                                                                          Will I be penalized under Bands if I choose to remain in one function, rather than move cross-functionally?                                                       No. Bands are designed to reward employees who broaden their experience and knowledgebase, whether it\u2019s in one function or cross-functionally. In fact, employees who want to develop their skills within a function should find that Bands allow them to do so with less concern over grade movement.                                                                                                                                                                          How will Bands help my career?                                                       Bands provide you more flexibility and support if you want developmental experiences that maximize your abilities and strengths, and assist you in advancing your career.                                                                                                                                                                          Is a promotion more important when it results in a change in Band?                                                       Moves from one Band to another will recognize significant new levels of expertise and experience, accompanied by a substantial change in the ability to operate independently or to manage the work of others. However, all promotions should enhance personal growth, meet career objectives and contribute to the success of the business.                                                                                            Glossary                                           Accountability                               The degree to which a particular job bears ultimate responsibility\u2014either for work results or for the performance of others. Accountability is one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                                Bands                               A structure that places each NYU job within one of six groups. The jobs in each group share certain key characteristics. Bands are a simplified job structure that supports a flatter organization and reduces barriers between functions and people. NYU Bands range from 51 to 56.                                                                Band-to-Band Promotion                               Events in which you take on a new job that provides the opportunity to make greater contributions to the University\u2019s success. In Bands, a promotion can occur when you move from a job in one band into a job in a higher-level band.                                                                Career Development                               An individual\u2019s growth\u2014whether it\u2019s in terms of skills, experience, knowledge, or other attributes\u2014which leads to greater professional opportunities.                                                                Career Mobility                               Movement from one function to another within the organization. Career mobility can help you gain the type of experience, skills, or knowledge to progress in your career. The movement can be cross-functional (from one area of the business to another), or it can be to another job in the same area where new experience, skills, or knowledge can be gained.                                                                Development Opportunity                               An ongoing process of developing the skills, knowledge and overall ability to make greater contributions to the University\u2019s success. Continued development assists you in your efforts to advance your career by providing opportunities to take on roles with greater responsibility. Bands support personal growth because they make it easier for you to consider jobs that would build (or strengthen) a broad base of skills and knowledge.                                                                Functional Discipline                               Refers to specific job function and related content expertise (e.g., technology, marketing, human resources, development).                                                                Job Evaluation                               The process through which a position is analyzed by Compensation to determine the most appropriate band.                                                               Job Family/Function                               A grouping of the major functions across the University. Job families form the basis for determining market reference ranges and setting the value for a given position. There are 16 job families, including:                     Code Job Family   A Business/Professional Administrative  C Non-Exempt Sciences Support  D Academic Program Support  F Finance/Real Estate/Procurement/Grant Management  G General Office Administration  H Health Services  I Campus/Auxiliary/Transportation, Facilities, Public Safety  K Development/Sponsored Research/Grant Writing  L Libraries  M Marketing, Advertising, Public Relations, Media, Video, Audio  O Other Non-Exempt Support, N.E.C.  R Human Resources  T Technology  W Engineering  Z Student Services/Athletics                                                Job Scope                               The breadth and depth of responsibilities associated with a given position in the University. Job scope is one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                               Layers (Flatter Organization Concept)                               The levels within an organization that place employees into a hierarchy. This hierarchy influences reporting relationships, teamwork, lines of communication, and almost every other aspect of the way the University\u2019s employees work with one another.                                                                Market Competitiveness                               Guidelines that set the University\u2019s pay levels in line with what similar institutions pay for similar jobs. Market competitiveness relates to one of NYU\u2019s compensation principles.                                                               Market Pricing                               The process through which the University analyzes pay for similar positions within peer organizations.                                                               Required Skills                               The complexity of a particular job and the degree of specialization that the person in the job must be able to demonstrate in day-to-day work. Required skills are one of the characteristics that determine which band a job is placed in.                                                              Skill-Building                               The process through which employees either acquire new competencies or strengthen existing ones. Skill-building is one of the most effective ways for employees to further their careers, because a broader base of skills puts employees in a position to take on a broader range of job openings. Bands support skill-building because they encourage employees to consider new jobs that would help them develop a broader range of skills.

The training course runs from approximately September 1 to June 30 each year.  Eligibility: This training is only open to those music therapists with a Masters degree in music therapy or who possess an undergraduate degree in music therapy and are undertaking this training concomitant to enrollment in a music therapy Masters program. It is essential that certification candidates have prior clinical experience. In some cases a successful music therapy internship may qualify. Certification candidates are expected to have already utilized improvisation in their clinical work. The interview-audition at this level serves to assess a candidate&#39;s capacity to fulfill the requirements of advanced training. In some instances it may be necessary to assign a candidate supplemental course work within the NYU music therapy masters program. Please note: The length of the training is typically one year but the need for continuing supervision may require clinical practice at the Center to be extended further in order to attain certification standards. Training Course Components: I. Clinical Practice Candidates will participate in the following clinical and related activities: individual and group music therapy with experiences as primary therapist and co-therapist; video/audio documentation (indexing) and analysis of therapy sessions; conferences with parents of child clients; communication with professionals involved in clients&#39; treatment; report writing; development of video technique in filming and producing clinical oriented video recordings of therapy sessions; compilation of video excerpts and/or research studies of music therapy processes; presentation of one case study of individual therapy including video examples and spoken commentary. II. Supervision Candidates have a clinical supervisor with whom they meet for a minimum of one hour of individual supervision each week. At times, the trainee and supervisor will conduct clinical work as a team. Supervision is used to facilitate the candidate&#39;s integration of the various experiences in Nordoff-Robbins coursework and clinical work. Support is offered in a variety of areas: musical skill-building and enhanced listening ability through review of audio/video recordings; addressing clinical issues emerging from sessions; and, processing personal reactions and their emergence in music. III. Coursework Our training program is unique in its comprehensive focus on the clinical application of music, and the development of musical resources. In addition to clinical work, there are instructional classes, which meet weekly. There are 5 classes offered in the course:  Clinical Improvisation Clinical Musicianship Practice and Theory of Group Music Therapy  Certification Seminar  Clinical Improvisation Workshop  Interns take the first three classes. Certification candidates take all five courses. These courses run throughout the training. Supervised clinical practice takes place concurrently. Readings will be assigned throughout the training.  Clinical Musicianship offers lectures that articulate the philosophical foundations of this work and illuminate empirically the process of music therapy through detailed analysis of individual therapy case presentations. Whenever possible, ideas from the lectures are worked on practically on piano or guitar.  Clinical Improvisation focuses on developing musical resources and practical skills, studying various musical styles, idioms and forms. Goals include increasing responsiveness and learning to improvise with a sense of compositional form and clinical intention. Individual reactions to music, as well as students&#39; personal musical styles, will be explored.  Certification Seminar provides participants with an opportunity to share excerpts of their ongoing work and receive practical feedback on their clinical-musical interventions. It will also be a place to follow up in more depth on some of the philosophical foundations addressed in the class on Clinical Musicianship.  Practice and Theory of Group Music Therapy covers a variety of topics through practice and direct application: Clinical considerations including goals, stages of development of the individual &amp; group, the place of improvisation and composition in group process; leadership styles; Techniques involved in improvising songs and developing instrumental improvisations; Techniques involved in both leading and playing composed or arranged songs and instrumental pieces; Composing vocal and instrumental pieces based on the needs of specific clients; Selection,care and use of a large number of specially-designed and general instruments. Trainees will have the opportunity to present original material in class. In addition, students are encouraged to bring in videotape excerpts of on-going group music therapy for discussion and feedback.  Clinical Improvisation Workshop provides a forum to explore and further develop musical resources for specific clinical situations. The focus is on practical, clinical techniques and role-playing specific situations that arise in trainees&#39; clinical practice. Discussions regarding aspects of the Nordoff-Robbins approach as well as any relevant clinical/musical issues the group wishes to examine are welcomed.
