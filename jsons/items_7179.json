Description       \u201cIf words are all we have as world and god,\u201d David Foster Wallace wrote, \u201cwe must treat them with care and rigor: we must worship.\u201d A new generation of readers seems to have taken Wallace\u2019s advice and his 1996 novel Infinite Jest is arguably the most talked about and influential American novel of the 21st century. Described as \u201chysterical realism,\u201d \u201cpost-ironic literature,\u201d the \u201cgrunge American novel,\u201d the \u201cdefinitive hipster novel,\u201d \u201cnew sincerity,\u201d and also as an \u201cawful novel\u201d showing \u201cno discernable talent,\u201d the book explores themes of depression, addiction, family, advertising, film theory, media studies, drugs, and tennis. But the book is more than the sum of these themes and is often described as anticipating coming cultural changes or even as preparing readers for these changes. This course will focus on reading the entirety of the novel and thinking about ways in which it interacts with contemporary culture, media, and technology. Course requirements include reading the entire 1079 pages (including footnotes), discussion, regular blog posts, and two short analytical papers or projects. We will also briefly look at writing about the novel in critical and popular works and in online forums. Both first time and return readers are welcome to the class.
