Description       This course focuses on some of the ways in which American literature, visual arts, and music reflect, embody, or respond to Buddhist principles and practice. The course includes discussion of Buddhist thought and history, particularly its emergence in the North American context, and of traditional Buddhist arts. Work by Han Shan, Meng Hao-Jan, Meng Chiao, Matsuo Basho, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, John Cage, Meredith Monk, Laurie Anderson, Bill Viola, Marina Abramovic, Gary Snyder, Li Young Li, Arther Sze, Lan Cao, Maxine Hong Kingston, Joanne Kyger, Philip Whalen, and Jane Hirschfield may be included, along with critical and historical work by Donald Lopez, Richard Seager, Rick Fields, Charles Prebish, John Whalen-Bridge, Jonathan Stalling, Jacquelynn Baas, Kay Larson, and Mary Jane Jacobs. Writing in the course includes informal response papers, three to five shorter essays, and a longer research essay, produced in multiple drafts with in-class workshops.
