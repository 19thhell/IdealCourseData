Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color.
