The final exam is on Monday the 18th  of December at 10am, in 628 Shimkin Hall. The handout summarising the second  half of the course that was given out in class on the 11th is available here . Thanks to everyone who participated in  the course!     Course Description    In this course we'll be thinking about immaterial spirits, futuristic computers and robots, fake computers with little people inside, Martians who behave like us but have an internal structure very different from ours, brains in vats, 'swampmen' who are formed by random aggregation of molecules.... We will ask whether these strange characters have thoughts and feelings, and whether, if so, they are like us in what they think and feel. We will consider how we might know the answers to these questions, and whether they even have right answers. The point is not to consider bizarre cases just for the sake of it, but to see what light we can shed on our own nature as beings with mental lives.

There is much to be said about  this question, and Jim Pryor has said it: please read his Guidelines  on writing a philosophy paper before you start writing.    Syllabus    Readings marked 'NM' are to be found in David Rosenthal's The Nature of  Mind . 'BMJ' abbreviates references to chapters in Braddon-Mitchell and  Jackson, Philosophy of Mind and Cognition .

For more general philosophical vocabulary, I recommend Jim Pryor's Philosophical Terms and Methods . The best reference work on the philosophy of mind is A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind , by Samuel Guttenplan (Blackwell, 1994). General encyclopedias and dictionaries of philosophy can also be useful: the most complete is the  Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy (ed. Edward Craig); two up-to-date one-volume references are the Oxford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (ed. Ted Honderich) and the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy (ed. Robert Audi). On the web, there is a Dictionary of the Philosophy of Mind , the MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences , and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , which currently doesn't have very much in the philosophy of mind. David Chalmers maintains the best philosophy of mind links page on the web.    Two other textbook-style overviews of the philosophy of mind are Jaegwon  Kim, Philosophy of Mind (Westview Press, 1998) and David  Armstrong, The Mind-Body Problem: An Opinionated Introduction   (Westview Press, 1999). William Lycan's Mind and Cognition  (2nd edition, Blackwell, 1999) is a book of readings that contains several  of the articles we will be reading that aren't in Rosenthal.    Warning: philosophers of mind disagree about how some of the key terms  should be defined: for example, some people use 'physicalism' for what I  will be calling the \"Identity Theory\". So if you come across a definition  of some term in one of the readings, don't just assume that it will carry  over into other readings."}]}]
