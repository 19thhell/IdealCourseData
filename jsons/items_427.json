M-TH 9:30-10:45, Randolph Ford 002. M-TH 3:30-4:45, Ari Zatlin \u2028Introduction to the essentials of Latin, the language of Vergil, Caesar, and Seneca. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 005, Intermediate Latin I: Reading Prose 001. M, T, TH 9:30-10:45, Benjamin Sammons 002. M, T, TH 3:30-4:45, Stefano Rebeggiani Teaches second-year students to read Latin prose through comprehensive grammar review; emphasis on the proper techniques for reading (correct phrase division, the identification of clauses, and reading in order); and practice reading at sight. Authors may include Caesar, Cicero, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Petronius, or Pliny, at the instructor's discretion. CLASS-UA 007, Elementary Ancient Greek I , M-TH, 11:00-12:15, Benjamin Sammons Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek I: Plato , M, T, W, 2:00-3:15, Raffaella Cribiore\u2028 Reading of Plato\u2019s Apology and Crito and selections from the Republic . The purpose of the course is to develop facility in reading Attic prose. Supplements readings in Greek with lectures on Socrates and the Platonic dialogues. CLASS-UA 146, Greek and Roman Epic , M&amp;W, 3:30-4:45, David Konstan The epic tales of Achilles, Odysseus, Jason and the Argo, Aeneas and the founding of Rome, are among the enduring works of classical literature. They reflect and transform ancient traditions of folk tale, comment on the social and political life of their own times, and offer descriptions of character and human conflict that speak to us across the ages. In this course, we shall read, in modern translations, Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey , Apollonius\u2019 Voyage of the Argo , Virgil\u2019s Aeneid , Lucan\u2019s Civil War , and Statius Thebaid , on the war for control of Thebes between the two sons of Oedipus. CLASS-UA 210 (same as SCA-UA 818.001), Sexuality and Gender in Greece and Rome , M&amp;W, 12:30-1:45, David Sider In this course we shall examine the various ways the sex lives of women and men were socially constructed from birth to death, primarily in ancient Greece, with some attention paid to Rome. Most of the ancient texts on the subject were written by men, but we shall also be sure to study some of the few texts that have come down to us written by women. All of these issues will be examined primarily through original sources such as ancient documents, graffiti, legal sources, and literary texts, as well as painting and sculpture. A term paper is required. CLASS-UA 291.001 (same as RELST-UA 293.001), Belief and Practice in Greek Religion , TH, 2:00-4:45, Barbara Kowalzig The religions of ancient Greece and Rome are often regarded as highly pragmatic: they are thought to focus on \u2018practice\u2019, that is to say on ritual activity, ceremony and performance. Religious practice and social life, it is held, are so intertwined that the question of \u2018belief\u2019 did not really matter to them. As a result, historians of these ancient religions have neglected the emotional and intellectual dimensions of ancient belief-systems. Our course challenges the artificial separation of belief from practice by examining both ancient evidence and modern theory. We will take a close look at the evidence of ancient ritual in the light of contemporary ritual theory; we will also study self-reflexive attitudes and philosophical approaches to religious practice and the divine, and follow the academic debate on belief versus practice from its beginnings to the exciting recent approaches informed by the cognitive sciences. We will discuss a wide variety of ancient evidence, ranging from literary texts such as ancient hymns, tragedy and historiography, to inscriptions and the archaeology of ancient shrines and religious imagery. Accompanied by readings from social and cultural anthropology, religious sociology, philosophy and performance studies, all ancient texts will be read in translation. CLASS-UA 316 (same as ARTH-UA 150), The Parthenon , M, 4:55-7:25, Joan Connelly This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum. CLASS-UA 352, Archaeologies of Greece , M&amp;W, 12:30-1:45, Joan Connelly This survey of Greek landscapes, sites, monuments, and images presents the art and archaeology of the Greek world from the Neolithic to the late antique period. Architecture, painting, sculpture, and decorative arts are studied within their full social, cultural, and religious contexts. From the palaces of the Aegean Bronze Age; to the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and Isthmia; to the city of Athens and the monuments of the Athenian Acropolis; to the great Hellenistic cities of Asia Minor, special focus is placed on landscape, myth, memory, materials, and ritual in shaping the visual culture of ancient Greece. The formation of the city-state and its political, economic, and religious institutions are explored within their full urban settings. The development and history of classical archaeology as a discipline are reviewed, along with issues of reception, connoisseurship, critical theory, and methods. CLASS-UA 409 (same as RELST-UA 409), Ancient Religion: The Divine and the Diviners , M&amp;W, 11:00-12:15, David Levene The study of ancient religion is one of the most rapidly changing in classical scholarship, as increasingly sophisticated theoretical models are brought to bear on it: this module will provide an opportunity to study Roman religion in the period 200 B.C.-A.D. 150 in the light of these. It will examine the ancient development and significance of Roman religion in two key areas: that of the Greek philosophers, from whom the Romans derived most of their theoretical arguments; and the Romans\u2019 own religious ideas, traditions, and practices, which played a central part in their social and political life. We will study a large range of Roman religious ideas and religious practices, illustrating them from numerous literary and archaeological sources. We will link this practical material to a study of the religious views of the main philosophical schools at Rome, in particular the Stoics and Epicureans; here we will focus particularly on two texts of religious theory by Cicero: The Nature of the Gods and On Divination . CLASS-UA 873, Advanced Latin: Ovid, Metamorphoses , M&amp;W, 4:55-6:10, Alessandro Barchiesi Ovid's Latin is ideal for empowering your reading skills in Latin, and his style is a good introduction to all the later tradition of writing in Latin (Imperial, Medieval, and early modern). At the same time the poem is a portal to Greek myth, and the only fictional Latin text that provides names and heroes to psychoanalisis (Narcissus) and gender studies. Reading Ovid therefore has both a futuristic and a retrospective kind of reward.\u2028The class is designed for those who want to improve their Latin while at the same time learning about ancient culture and in particular its imaginary and the sensual world of mythological fiction. CLASS-UA 971, Advanced Greek: Herodotus , T&amp;TH, 11:00-12:15, Barbara Kowalzig This course of Advanced Greek focuses on passages across Herodotus\u2019 Histories that discuss the interrelationship of religion and society in Greek and non-Greek cultures, such as Lydia, Persia, Egypt, the peoples of the Ancient Near East, Libya and the Black Sea populations. We will read chapters concerning Herodotus\u2019 views of the role of religion in history; on the origins of the gods, on the workings of polytheism, on transcultural mythologies, on ritual and social customs and how they influence the course of history and the Persian Wars in particular. Emphasis will be laid on fluency in reading, on morphology, syntax and vocabulary; and on gaining an insight into relevant scholarship on Herodotus.

M-TH 9:30-10:45, Randolph Ford 002. M-TH 3:30-4:45, Ari Zatlin \u2028Introduction to the essentials of Latin, the language of Vergil, Caesar, and Seneca. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Latin rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 005, Intermediate Latin I: Reading Prose 001. M, T, TH 9:30-10:45, Benjamin Sammons 002. M, T, TH 3:30-4:45, Stefano Rebeggiani Teaches second-year students to read Latin prose through comprehensive grammar review; emphasis on the proper techniques for reading (correct phrase division, the identification of clauses, and reading in order); and practice reading at sight. Authors may include Caesar, Cicero, Cornelius Nepos, Livy, Petronius, or Pliny, at the instructor's discretion. CLASS-UA 007, Elementary Ancient Greek I , M-TH, 11:00-12:15, Benjamin Sammons Introduction to the complex but highly beautiful language of ancient Greece--the language of Homer, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Plato. Students learn the essentials of ancient Greek vocabulary, morphology, and syntax. Five hours of instruction weekly, with both oral and written drills and an emphasis on the ability to read Greek rather than merely translate it. CLASS-UA 009, Intermediate Ancient Greek I: Plato , M, T, W, 2:00-3:15, Raffaella Cribiore\u2028 Reading of Plato\u2019s Apology and Crito and selections from the Republic . The purpose of the course is to develop facility in reading Attic prose. Supplements readings in Greek with lectures on Socrates and the Platonic dialogues. CLASS-UA 146, Greek and Roman Epic , M&amp;W, 3:30-4:45, David Konstan The epic tales of Achilles, Odysseus, Jason and the Argo, Aeneas and the founding of Rome, are among the enduring works of classical literature. They reflect and transform ancient traditions of folk tale, comment on the social and political life of their own times, and offer descriptions of character and human conflict that speak to us across the ages. In this course, we shall read, in modern translations, Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey , Apollonius\u2019 Voyage of the Argo , Virgil\u2019s Aeneid , Lucan\u2019s Civil War , and Statius Thebaid , on the war for control of Thebes between the two sons of Oedipus. CLASS-UA 210 (same as SCA-UA 818.001), Sexuality and Gender in Greece and Rome , M&amp;W, 12:30-1:45, David Sider In this course we shall examine the various ways the sex lives of women and men were socially constructed from birth to death, primarily in ancient Greece, with some attention paid to Rome. Most of the ancient texts on the subject were written by men, but we shall also be sure to study some of the few texts that have come down to us written by women. All of these issues will be examined primarily through original sources such as ancient documents, graffiti, legal sources, and literary texts, as well as painting and sculpture. A term paper is required. CLASS-UA 291.001 (same as RELST-UA 293.001), Belief and Practice in Greek Religion , TH, 2:00-4:45, Barbara Kowalzig The religions of ancient Greece and Rome are often regarded as highly pragmatic: they are thought to focus on \u2018practice\u2019, that is to say on ritual activity, ceremony and performance. Religious practice and social life, it is held, are so intertwined that the question of \u2018belief\u2019 did not really matter to them. As a result, historians of these ancient religions have neglected the emotional and intellectual dimensions of ancient belief-systems. Our course challenges the artificial separation of belief from practice by examining both ancient evidence and modern theory. We will take a close look at the evidence of ancient ritual in the light of contemporary ritual theory; we will also study self-reflexive attitudes and philosophical approaches to religious practice and the divine, and follow the academic debate on belief versus practice from its beginnings to the exciting recent approaches informed by the cognitive sciences. We will discuss a wide variety of ancient evidence, ranging from literary texts such as ancient hymns, tragedy and historiography, to inscriptions and the archaeology of ancient shrines and religious imagery. Accompanied by readings from social and cultural anthropology, religious sociology, philosophy and performance studies, all ancient texts will be read in translation. CLASS-UA 316 (same as ARTH-UA 150), The Parthenon , M, 4:55-7:25, Joan Connelly This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum. CLASS-UA 352, Archaeologies of Greece , M&amp;W, 12:30-1:45, Joan Connelly This survey of Greek landscapes, sites, monuments, and images presents the art and archaeology of the Greek world from the Neolithic to the late antique period. Architecture, painting, sculpture, and decorative arts are studied within their full social, cultural, and religious contexts. From the palaces of the Aegean Bronze Age; to the Panhellenic sanctuaries at Olympia, Delphi, Nemea, and Isthmia; to the city of Athens and the monuments of the Athenian Acropolis; to the great Hellenistic cities of Asia Minor, special focus is placed on landscape, myth, memory, materials, and ritual in shaping the visual culture of ancient Greece. The formation of the city-state and its political, economic, and religious institutions are explored within their full urban settings. The development and history of classical archaeology as a discipline are reviewed, along with issues of reception, connoisseurship, critical theory, and methods. CLASS-UA 409 (same as RELST-UA 409), Ancient Religion: The Divine and the Diviners , M&amp;W, 11:00-12:15, David Levene The study of ancient religion is one of the most rapidly changing in classical scholarship, as increasingly sophisticated theoretical models are brought to bear on it: this module will provide an opportunity to study Roman religion in the period 200 B.C.-A.D. 150 in the light of these. It will examine the ancient development and significance of Roman religion in two key areas: that of the Greek philosophers, from whom the Romans derived most of their theoretical arguments; and the Romans\u2019 own religious ideas, traditions, and practices, which played a central part in their social and political life. We will study a large range of Roman religious ideas and religious practices, illustrating them from numerous literary and archaeological sources. We will link this practical material to a study of the religious views of the main philosophical schools at Rome, in particular the Stoics and Epicureans; here we will focus particularly on two texts of religious theory by Cicero: The Nature of the Gods and On Divination . CLASS-UA 873, Advanced Latin: Ovid, Metamorphoses , M&amp;W, 4:55-6:10, Alessandro Barchiesi Ovid's Latin is ideal for empowering your reading skills in Latin, and his style is a good introduction to all the later tradition of writing in Latin (Imperial, Medieval, and early modern). At the same time the poem is a portal to Greek myth, and the only fictional Latin text that provides names and heroes to psychoanalisis (Narcissus) and gender studies. Reading Ovid therefore has both a futuristic and a retrospective kind of reward.\u2028The class is designed for those who want to improve their Latin while at the same time learning about ancient culture and in particular its imaginary and the sensual world of mythological fiction. CLASS-UA 971, Advanced Greek: Herodotus , T&amp;TH, 11:00-12:15, Barbara Kowalzig This course of Advanced Greek focuses on passages across Herodotus\u2019 Histories that discuss the interrelationship of religion and society in Greek and non-Greek cultures, such as Lydia, Persia, Egypt, the peoples of the Ancient Near East, Libya and the Black Sea populations. We will read chapters concerning Herodotus\u2019 views of the role of religion in history; on the origins of the gods, on the workings of polytheism, on transcultural mythologies, on ritual and social customs and how they influence the course of history and the Persian Wars in particular. Emphasis will be laid on fluency in reading, on morphology, syntax and vocabulary; and on gaining an insight into relevant scholarship on Herodotus.

Apart from simply reading and understanding the texts, we will be seeking to examine their place\u2028in the development of Latin literature; we will also be surveying a variety of critical approaches adopted by modern scholars, through close readings of key articles and books on the different authors. CLASS-GA 2972 Pindar, Monday 4:15-6:15, Joel Lidov (CUNY) The first aim of this seminar will be to achieve familiarity with the rhetoric of Pindar\u2019s choral lyric: its habits of expression, its topoi, its grammar and style. We will seek to understand the ethical, logical, and emotional appeals by which the poet persuades his audience to celebrate as a common good the athletic victory of a wealthy member of a ruling family. By analyzing the Odes as poems continuing traditions of Homeric, Aeolic, and elegiac poetry, and by confronting the problems they presented to the modern history of interpretation and criticism, our discussions may lead to some insight into how Pindar, in the accomplishment of his rhetorical task, expressed such a persuasive understanding of the human condition that his name became emblematic of poetic power and achievement. \u2028We will begin by taking advantage of the aid offered by M.M. Willcock\u2019s Cambridge edition: Pindar, Victory Odes, and proceed to reading a selection of the other odes, particularly Olympian and Pythian. In addition to Willcock, participants must have the Snell-Maehler Teubner edition: Pindarus, Carmina cum fragmentis, Pars I: Epinicia (now published by K.G. Saur, ISBN 3-598-71585-4; the current edition is the eighth but earlier editions are just as acceptable). You are also encouraged to obtain at least the first volume of W. Race\u2019s Loeb edition, and his Style and Rhetoric in Pindar\u2019s Odes (A.P.A. Monographs, Oxford Univ. Press). Anyone who can still find a copy of William Slater\u2019s Lexicon to Pindar (de Gruyter, 1969) will not be sorry, but it is long out of print. There will be a final exam (memorization and translation) and a final paper. CLASS-GA 2912 Herodotus, Monday 6:30-8:30, Jennifer Roberts (CUNY) The work of Herodotus represents a unique mixed genre that defies categorization. Known both as the \u201cFather of History\u201d and the \u201cFather of Lies,\u201d Herodotus has left us invaluable information about the ancient Mediterranean world as well as the development of historical thought in Greece. In this course we will read good chunks of Herodotus\u2019s text in Greek. Class time will be divided between translation and interpretation of the text, and students will give oral presentations on recent scholarly work concerning Herodotus. There will be two tests and a term paper. CLASS-GA 2868 Seneca, Tuesday 4:15-6:15, David Konstan (CUNY) In this course, we will read selections of the major prose works of Seneca, including On Anger (Books 1 and 2), The Consolation to Marcia, On Clemency, On Benefits (Books 1-3), On the Blessed Life, The Natural Questions (Book 6), and the Letters to Lucilius; we will also read one of his tragedies (Thyestes). The object of the course is to gain an appreciation of Seneca\u2019s prose style as well as his basic ideas as a Stoic (concerning anger, grief, pity, and friendship) and his role as a major figure in the governing of the Roman Empire. Secondary readings will be assigned in the course of the semester. CLASS-GA 3002 Hellenistic History, Egypt from Alexander the Great to Ptolemy II, Tuesday 6:30-8:30, Sandra Gambetti (CUNY) Through the analysis of primary sources and the comparative commentary of scholarly literature, this course will study the first one hundred years of the Ptolemaic state, from the end of the 4th c. to the end of the 3rd c. BCE. The general frame will be the formation of the new Hellenistic state from the roots of the old Pharaonic one, with focus on several more specific aspects, some of which are: establishment of the authority, religion and ruler cult, construction of an extended empire, economy and use of the land. CLASS-GA 3004 Third Sophistic, Wednesday 4:15-6:15, Raffaella Cribiore (NYU) This course intends to inquire into issues of identity, rhetoric, religion and relationship with the past starting from the Second Sophistic and concentrating on late antiquity and especially on the fourth century in the Roman East. The texts read will be mostly in Greek except for the Latin history of Ammianus. Among the authors read there will be Dio Chrysostom, Libanius, Themistius, the emperor Julian, and John Chrysostom. Some attention will be paid to the enduring meaning of mythology and the relationship between pagan and Christian intellectuals. CLASS-GA 1011 Greek Prose Composition/Stylistics, Wednesday 6:30-8:30, David Sider (NYU) Exercises in Greek composition, starting with the basics of syntax and proceeding to stylistic niceties such as are found in the historians, orators, and Plato. CLASS-GA 3000 Renaissance Responses to Classical and Late Antique Literary Criticism, Thursday 4:15-6:15, Christina Sogno and Tanya Pollard (Fordham) This course explores Renaissance responses to Classical and Late Antique literary criticism, with an emphasis on their consequences for both theory and practice of literary genres. We will pay particular attention to discussions of tragedy, comedy, tragicomedy, satire, and fiction, with attention both to theoretical treatises and to examples of these genres in both periods. Readings will include selections from Plato, Aristotle, Euripides, Heliodorus, Longinus, Horace, Cicero, Plautus, Cinthio, Guarini, Scaliger, Sidney, Jonson, and Shakespeare. All the texts for the course will be available in translation, but PhD students in Classics will read classical and neo-Latin texts in the original, and others with the requisite languages are welcome to do so as well. Requirements will include presentations and either a research paper or an English translation of, and commentary on, a relevant Latin text not available in translation. CLASS-GA 2814 Lucan, Thursday 6:30-8:30, Matthew McGowan (Fordham) This course covers Lucan\u2019s Bellum Civile or Pharsalia in its entirety. We will start by reading Caesar\u2019s Commentarii de Bello Civili in Latin and English and then tackle roughly one book per week of Lucan\u2019s epic on the civil war between Caesar and Pompey. Our aim is to situate Lucan\u2019s poem in its immediate historical context and in relation to the broader tradition of Greek and Latin literature. In addition to surveying an array of contemporary scholarship, we will also consult ancient and Renaissance commentaries, which will be provided to the class in the form of a course-packet. Over the course of the semester each student will be expected to deliver an oral report and to lead the subsequent group discussion. There will be two 50-minute translation exams and a final research paper. CLASS-GA 3401 The Parthenon, Monday 4:55-7:25, Joan Connelly (NYU) This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum. At The IFA Clemente Marconi: Lecture, Greek Art and Architecture II: The Classical Period. This course is an introduction to the urbanism, architecture, and visual arts of the Greek world during the Early Classical (480-450), High Classical (450-400) and Late Classical (400-300) periods. While providing a solid background in the art and architecture of this period, this course explores critical questions about the very nature of Classical Art: the status of the artist and of the architect; the conditions and the context for artistic production; patronage; the relation between art and society; the nature of mimesis and the response by the public. Seminar (Proseminar), Approaches to Greek and Roman Art and Architecture. This seminar will systematically examine the study of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture at a critical time in its development. In recent years, this field has been characterized by an ever-increasing range of approaches, under the influence of various disciplines such as Sociology, Semiotics, Gender Theory, Anthropology, Reception Theory, and Hermeneutics. The scope of this seminar is to explore key aspects of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture, and to assess the current state of the discipline by reviewing and subjecting to critical scrutiny its current larger theoretical implications, methodologies, and directions of research.
