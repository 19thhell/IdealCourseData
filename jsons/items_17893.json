These scholars use a variety of interdisciplinary approaches to investigate critical issues of the development, meaning, practice, and social significance of science. Their work is supported by several different schools and departments at NYU. The new Science and Society Minor brings together their teaching, and research projects are discussed with city-wide scholars at the NYC History of Science Working Group.
