Partnerships       Champaigne, IL    Mapleton, CO    Guilford County, NC    Rochester, NY    Schenectady, NY       Projects    The Ford Study    This two-year research on More and Better Learning Time (MBLT) initiatives in Rochester and Harlem (ADC organization) including quantitative analysis of school and student level data and surveys and qualitative interviews of central office and school administrators, teachers, students, parents and community stakeholders, as well as MBLT administrators and staff. In addition, participant observations of MBLT planning meetings and classrooms within each school will provide important ethnographic evidence on the process of implementation.    There will be two phases of the research. The purpose of Phase I (for the first year) is to set up a data system that in the second stage will be used to provide a longitudinal analysis of the effects of the programs and, in addition, to work closely with each program to help them use formative research to implement their programs effectively. We will use the same design and protocols for all sites in order to provide a comparative analysis of the process of program implementation and eventually the effects of MBLT.        Staff    Dr. Eddie Fergus Principal Investigator    A former high school teacher, he has and continues to provide technical assistance and analysis on education policy and research to school districts.

Partnerships       Champaigne, IL    Mapleton, CO    Guilford County, NC    Rochester, NY    Schenectady, NY       Projects    The Ford Study    This two-year research on More and Better Learning Time (MBLT) initiatives in Rochester and Harlem (ADC organization) including quantitative analysis of school and student level data and surveys and qualitative interviews of central office and school administrators, teachers, students, parents and community stakeholders, as well as MBLT administrators and staff. In addition, participant observations of MBLT planning meetings and classrooms within each school will provide important ethnographic evidence on the process of implementation.    There will be two phases of the research. The purpose of Phase I (for the first year) is to set up a data system that in the second stage will be used to provide a longitudinal analysis of the effects of the programs and, in addition, to work closely with each program to help them use formative research to implement their programs effectively. We will use the same design and protocols for all sites in order to provide a comparative analysis of the process of program implementation and eventually the effects of MBLT.
