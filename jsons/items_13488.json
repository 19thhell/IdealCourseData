In this way, knowledge of the cultures, art, languages, religions, economic systems, and interactions of the ancient world can be deepened and expanded. Students have the opportunity to take research seminars, colloquia, lectures, and directed readings with the outstanding faculty within ISAW and NYU and at other universities and institutions in the metropolitan area. Additionally, the ISAW Visiting Research Scholar program brings in experts in a variety of fields from across the world who participate in the graduate seminars and present public lectures, serving as an additional vital resource for our students.    Courses of study are structured to suit individual strengths and interests in consultation with a small faculty committee arranged for each student. The program is recorded in a written \u2018doctoral contract\u2019, which may be revised by mutual agreement of the committee and the student as the student\u2019s work develops. All students are supported by multi-year 12-month fellowships.    Furthering its goal of making connections across disciplines is ISAW\u2019s strong sense of community. Daily communal coffee, lunch, and tea times offer opportunities for all students, visiting research scholars, and faculty to come together to discuss their research projects, classes, and experiences.    Why Choose ISAW?

In this way, knowledge of the cultures, art, languages, religions, economic systems, and interactions of the ancient world can be deepened and expanded. Students have the opportunity to take research seminars, colloquia, lectures, and directed readings with the outstanding faculty within ISAW and NYU and at other universities and institutions in the metropolitan area. Additionally, the ISAW Visiting Research Scholar program brings in experts in a variety of fields from across the world who participate in the graduate seminars and present public lectures, serving as an additional vital resource for our students.    Courses of study are structured to suit individual strengths and interests in consultation with a small faculty committee arranged for each student. The program is recorded in a written \u2018doctoral contract\u2019, which may be revised by mutual agreement of the committee and the student as the student\u2019s work develops. All students are supported by multi-year 12-month fellowships.    Furthering its goal of making connections across disciplines is ISAW\u2019s strong sense of community. Daily communal coffee, lunch, and tea times offer opportunities for all students, visiting research scholars, and faculty to come together to discuss their research projects, classes, and experiences.
