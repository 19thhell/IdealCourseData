Founded on this belief, our vision is to develop people and ideas that transform 21st century problems into opportunities to create value for business and society.  An Education in Possible is our promise to deliver a unique education that combines rigor in the classroom with engagement beyond the classroom to broaden perspectives and change mindsets. We promote disruptive thinking and encourage experimentation to create value. We fulfill our promise through four core values: Academic Excellence, IQ + EQ, Collaborative Community and The Energy of a Global Hub.    Academic Excellence   Collaborative Community   IQ + EQ   The Energy Of A Global Hub    Academic Excellence    Academic excellence is the foundation of our education. We believe excellence is rooted in a broad awareness of global dynamics and realized by equipping students to solve real problems in real time. By working hand-in-hand with unparalleled faculty and peers, our students develop and implement ideas that challenge the limits of business and create value to change the world for the better.     Collaborative Community    The culture of our education is shaped by the fundamental belief that collective initiative far exceeds the sum of individual efforts. Inside and outside the classroom through peers, faculty and the greater Stern network, collaboration is deeply woven into every part of Stern life.     IQ + EQ    Our education is fueled by a community of exceptional individuals&ndash;individuals who possess both intellectual and interpersonal strengths to act as forces for change by turning ideas into action and inspiring others to their cause.     The Energy Of A Global Hub    Our education takes place in a classroom unlike any other at the intersection of world business, policy and culture. We believe in harnessing the energy of global hubs to immerse students in hands-on learning opportunities and give them the resources they need to apply their education and bring their ideas to life.

Founded on this belief, our vision is to develop people and ideas that transform 21st century problems into opportunities to create value for business and society.  An Education in Possible is our promise to deliver a unique education that combines rigor in the classroom with engagement beyond the classroom to broaden perspectives and change mindsets. We promote disruptive thinking and encourage experimentation to create value. We fulfill our promise through four core values: Academic Excellence, IQ + EQ, Collaborative Community and The Energy of a Global Hub.    Academic Excellence   Collaborative Community   IQ + EQ   The Energy Of A Global Hub    Academic Excellence    Academic excellence is the foundation of our education. We believe excellence is rooted in a broad awareness of global dynamics and realized by equipping students to solve real problems in real time. By working hand-in-hand with unparalleled faculty and peers, our students develop and implement ideas that challenge the limits of business and create value to change the world for the better.     Collaborative Community    The culture of our education is shaped by the fundamental belief that collective initiative far exceeds the sum of individual efforts. Inside and outside the classroom through peers, faculty and the greater Stern network, collaboration is deeply woven into every part of Stern life.     IQ + EQ    Our education is fueled by a community of exceptional individuals&ndash;individuals who possess both intellectual and interpersonal strengths to act as forces for change by turning ideas into action and inspiring others to their cause.     The Energy Of A Global Hub    Our education takes place in a classroom unlike any other at the intersection of world business, policy and culture. We believe in harnessing the energy of global hubs to immerse students in hands-on learning opportunities and give them the resources they need to apply their education and bring their ideas to life.
