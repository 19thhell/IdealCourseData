Prerequisite courses not taken at NYU require a minimum grade of B. Any student who is missing some or all of the prerequisite courses must complete these in addition to the 53 units required for the MS degree (see below).    Note: Beginning in fall 2015, students must have a completed academic course in Linguistics or Science of Language as a prerequisite to the master's curriculum. The linguistic course may be taken at NYU, another college, or online, with permission of a faculty member. Due to the high number of interested applicants, our department is unable to review transcripts and approve prerequisite courses for prospective students. It is advised that students compare the course descriptions of previously taken courses in communicative sciences and disorders to the department&rsquo;s prerequisite course descriptions, which can be found on our website&rsquo;s Course Listing page, in order to determine if the content is an accurate match. In addition, students may utilize our Prerequisite Course Equivalent resource in order to determine some of the alternative course titles that we have accepted from outside universities.

These language, science, and math requirements are necessary for New York State licensure and ASHA certification . The intent of this standard is to require students to have a broad liberal arts and science background. Specifically, students must:       Complete of three units of a language other than English.    Students must have transcript credit (which could include course work, advanced placement, CLEP, or examination of equivalency) for each of the following areas: human/animal biological science, physical science, social/behavioral science, and statistics. Appropriate course work may include human anatomy and physiology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, genetics, physics, inorganic and organic chemistry, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and statistics. Please note: Courses in biological and physical sciences and research methodology specifically related to communication sciences and disorders may not be applied for certification purposes in this category.       In addition to transcript credit, applicants may be required by their graduate program to provide further evidence of meeting this requirement. These prerequisite courses do not carry graduate credit for the master's degree.    Learning Outcomes    As a graduate of the MS program in Communicative Sciences and Disorders, you will:       Possess prerequisite skills in oral and written communication sufficient for entry into professional practice    Demonstrate knowledge of the principles of biological sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and social/behavioral sciences    Demonstrate knowledge of basic human communication and swallowing processes, including their biological, neurological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, linguistic, and cultural bases    Demonstrate knowledge of the nature of speech, language, hearing, and communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders, including etiologies, characteristics, anatomical /physiological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates    Apply principles and methods of prevention, assessment, and intervention for people with communication and swallowing disorders, including consideration of anatomical/physiological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates of the disorders    Demonstrate knowledge and follow the standards of ethical conduct    Demonstrate knowledge of processes used in research and the integration of research principles into evidence-based clinical practice    Demonstrate knowledge of contemporary professional issues    Demonstrate knowledge about certification, specialty recognition, licensure, and other relevant professional credentials    Complete a supervised practicum that includes experience with individuals across the life span and from culturally/linguistic diverse backgrounds.
