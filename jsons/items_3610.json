Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century. Conducted in English.

The works of important French artists working elsewhere will also be considered. Students will visit numerous sites in Paris, including the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e des Invalides, the Musee Carnavalet, the Hotel de Soubise, and important churches, and study in addition many sites visiting distance from the capital, such as Chambord, Fontainebleau, Maisons-Lafitte, and Versailles. Painters discussed include the Clouet family, Georges de la Tour, Nicolas Poussin, Claude Lorrain, Charles LeBrun, Jean-Baptiste-Simeon Chardin, Antoine Watteau, Francois Boucher, and Jean-Honore Fragonard. Conducted in English.                                                                      Le Grand Paris, Present and Future - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               Paris by the Seine stars in more Hollywood films than any other city. London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .   Sample Syllabus                                                                    European Society and Cinema - FREN-UA 9865 or\u00a0DRLIT-UA 9524 - 4 points                               This course examines the social, economic, and political role of cinema in Europe, with an emphasis on recent decades. It takes into consideration transformations in film as a narrative form and cultural product in the shift from national cinema traditions to global communications networks and media convergence. Films studied include popular, independent, and avant-garde films from a range of countries and cultures. The structures of production, distribution, and conservation are also considered through visits to exhibitions, archives and movie theatres. Conducted in English.

Students come into close contact with the daily life of the site at which they are studying through a two-semester experiential learning sequence, which is designed to contextualize the site's culture and give students internship or internship-like experiences in the community. The fall Experiential Learning I course begins the immersion experience with a variety of community-based projects and an advanced introduction to the site's cultural and social identity. The spring Experiential Learning II includes a 2-credit on-site component that emphasizes internships (or the equivalent) and a 2-credit Junior Independent Research Seminar (for which students will register separately), in which students work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests at different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis. Conducted in English.                                                                      Intro to the Parisian Contemporary Art Scene - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               NYU Art History students: This course counts for Art History Elective credit.   This course aims to understand and appreciate the creativity and dynamism of the Parisian art scene today through an exploration of contemporary art in the capital. The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators. Reference to major avant-garde art movements of the past such as dada, geometrical abstraction, surrealism and expressionism will also be made in order to better situate today\u2019s artistic concerns. Conducted in English.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Ideal Society in Theory &amp; Practice, France Since the Middle Ages -\u00a0FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               An introduction to classic texts of French political and social philosophy. Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre. Conducted in English.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.                                                                      Power & Representation: Art from the Ancien R\u00e9gime to the Age of Revolution\u00a0-\u00a0FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points (may be counted for MCC credit)                               Please note that this course can be counted toward the NYU Media, Culture, &amp; Communication major. Should you choose to enroll in this course, please notify your MCC primary advisor. He or she will make sure this course is accurately reflected in your academic record.   Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world. Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019?

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

The technological, mediological, and digital worlds constitute a part of a shared material culture with profound implications for human experience. In this course, attempt to develop a critical heuristic which maps the topoi of the socio-eco-techno system. Drawing on mediology, ethics, and the French school of the anthropology of techniques, we explore such topoi as a form of \u201cdeep\u201d historical sediment and also to understand how our values are negotiated and transformed via our on-going rapport with the technological.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Birth of Democracy in Europe - FREN-UA 9091 or HIST-UA 9091 or POL-UA 9591 - 4 points                               We begin with a definition of the term &quot;democracy&quot; as developed by the Athenian City-State in the 5th century before Christ, before moving on to discuss its reappraisal by such theoreticians of the 17th century as Locke, or of the Enlightenment, such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years. Topics include the challenges of the post-colonial period (immigration, la francophonie, questions of identity), France in and of the European Union, France and globalization, and social issues in current events (the status of women, la banlieue, social exclusion).

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

Paris, City of Theater - FREN-UA 9968 - 4 points                               Since the 17th century Paris has been as a city of and for the theatre, from the great sites and  events that have marked theatre history, to the spectacle and fantasy that the city imparts.  In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Sample Syllabus                                                                     Internship Seminar Fieldwork - NODEP-UA 9982 or INDIV-UG 9350 - 4 points                               Enrollment by permission only. Application required.     This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and two full days and one half day (Monday-Friday) for their internship. Internship placements are made by EUSA, an organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above).

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture. Taught in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.                                                                      Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

This course examines the rise of realist and impressionist art in Europe within its cultural, historical and social contexts. The novelty of these two important movements is considered in relation to preceding artistic movements, namely neo-classicism and romanticism. Works by artists such as Delacroix, Courbet, Millet, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are studied. The course includes both class lectures with slides and museum visits.

In this course we explore the contemporary arts in France in their historic and social context. Beginning with current trends, we attempt to situate what\u2019s new within a longer tradition of artistic production. Themes studied include the nature of the object, the monochrome, the body, the idea of nature, personal mythologies, the importance of light.

French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Special emphasis on the aesthetic and intellectual currents that have shaped French literature. Conducted in French.

Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.                                                                    French Society and Culture from the Middle-Ages to the Present -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09163 - 4 points                               This course approaches the study of French civilization from the medieval period to World War II through an exploration of fine arts, music, philosophy, literature, and history. A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage. Conducted in French.                                                                      Problems in Contemporary French Society -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09965 - 4 points                               The course aims to introduce students to contemporary French society through an examination of particular social groups and categories, with a focus on French youth and notions of gender. Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.                                                                    French-African Relations -\u00a0SCA-UA 9914 or HIST-UA 9510 - 4 points                               A historical and political inquiry into the French system of relations with Francophone Africa from the \u2018race to Empire\u2019 in the 19th century to the current day. The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France.

Sample Syllabus                                                                      The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

The works of important French artists working elsewhere will also be considered. Students will visit numerous sites in Paris, including the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e des Invalides, the Musee Carnavalet, the Hotel de Soubise, and important churches, and study in addition many sites visiting distance from the capital, such as Chambord, Fontainebleau, Maisons-Lafitte, and Versailles.

Le Grand Paris, Present and Future - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               Paris by the Seine stars in more Hollywood films than any other city. London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Intro to the Parisian Contemporary Art Scene - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               NYU Art History students: This course counts for Art History Elective credit.   This course aims to understand and appreciate the creativity and dynamism of the Parisian art scene today through an exploration of contemporary art in the capital. The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators. Reference to major avant-garde art movements of the past such as dada, geometrical abstraction, surrealism and expressionism will also be made in order to better situate today\u2019s artistic concerns.

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.                                                                      Power & Representation: Art from the Ancien R\u00e9gime to the Age of Revolution\u00a0-\u00a0FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points (may be counted for MCC credit)                               Please note that this course can be counted toward the NYU Media, Culture, &amp; Communication major. Should you choose to enroll in this course, please notify your MCC primary advisor. He or she will make sure this course is accurately reflected in your academic record.   Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

The technological, mediological, and digital worlds constitute a part of a shared material culture with profound implications for human experience. In this course, attempt to develop a critical heuristic which maps the topoi of the socio-eco-techno system. Drawing on mediology, ethics, and the French school of the anthropology of techniques, we explore such topoi as a form of \u201cdeep\u201d historical sediment and also to understand how our values are negotiated and transformed via our on-going rapport with the technological.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years.

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Sample Syllabus                                                                     Internship Seminar Fieldwork - NODEP-UA 9982 or INDIV-UG 9350 - 4 points                               Enrollment by permission only. Application required.     This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and two full days and one half day (Monday-Friday) for their internship. Internship placements are made by EUSA, an organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above).

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture. Taught in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.                                                                      Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

This course examines the rise of realist and impressionist art in Europe within its cultural, historical and social contexts. The novelty of these two important movements is considered in relation to preceding artistic movements, namely neo-classicism and romanticism. Works by artists such as Delacroix, Courbet, Millet, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are studied. The course includes both class lectures with slides and museum visits.

In this course we explore the contemporary arts in France in their historic and social context. Beginning with current trends, we attempt to situate what\u2019s new within a longer tradition of artistic production. Themes studied include the nature of the object, the monochrome, the body, the idea of nature, personal mythologies, the importance of light.

French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Special emphasis on the aesthetic and intellectual currents that have shaped French literature. Conducted in French.

Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.                                                                    French Society and Culture from the Middle-Ages to the Present -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09163 - 4 points                               This course approaches the study of French civilization from the medieval period to World War II through an exploration of fine arts, music, philosophy, literature, and history. A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage. Conducted in French.                                                                      Problems in Contemporary French Society -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09965 - 4 points                               The course aims to introduce students to contemporary French society through an examination of particular social groups and categories, with a focus on French youth and notions of gender. Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.                                                                    French-African Relations -\u00a0SCA-UA 9914 or HIST-UA 9510 - 4 points                               A historical and political inquiry into the French system of relations with Francophone Africa from the \u2018race to Empire\u2019 in the 19th century to the current day. The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France.

Sample Syllabus                                                                      The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

The works of important French artists working elsewhere will also be considered. Students will visit numerous sites in Paris, including the Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e des Invalides, the Musee Carnavalet, the Hotel de Soubise, and important churches, and study in addition many sites visiting distance from the capital, such as Chambord, Fontainebleau, Maisons-Lafitte, and Versailles.

Le Grand Paris, Present and Future - ARTH-UA 9850 - 4 points                               Paris by the Seine stars in more Hollywood films than any other city. London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Intro to the Parisian Contemporary Art Scene - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               NYU Art History students: This course counts for Art History Elective credit.   This course aims to understand and appreciate the creativity and dynamism of the Parisian art scene today through an exploration of contemporary art in the capital. The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators. Reference to major avant-garde art movements of the past such as dada, geometrical abstraction, surrealism and expressionism will also be made in order to better situate today\u2019s artistic concerns.

Consideration of the historical influences upon and the historical impact of French thinkers. Through close readings and analysis of selected passages from primary sources (in English translation), and those few seminal non-French works that inspired new directions in French thought, we will explore the intellectual framework and historical references that inform French debates on politics and society to the present day. Philosophers to be considered include St. Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Montaigne, de la Fontaine, Descartes, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Napoleon Bonaparte, Saint-Simon, Prudhon, Marx, Jules Ferry, Zola, Fanon, Camus, and Sartre.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.                                                                      Power & Representation: Art from the Ancien R\u00e9gime to the Age of Revolution\u00a0-\u00a0FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points (may be counted for MCC credit)                               Please note that this course can be counted toward the NYU Media, Culture, &amp; Communication major. Should you choose to enroll in this course, please notify your MCC primary advisor. He or she will make sure this course is accurately reflected in your academic record.   Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

The technological, mediological, and digital worlds constitute a part of a shared material culture with profound implications for human experience. In this course, attempt to develop a critical heuristic which maps the topoi of the socio-eco-techno system. Drawing on mediology, ethics, and the French school of the anthropology of techniques, we explore such topoi as a form of \u201cdeep\u201d historical sediment and also to understand how our values are negotiated and transformed via our on-going rapport with the technological.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

The first half of the course focuses on the political, socio-economic, and cultural history of France in the modern period, from roughly 1870 to the 1980. The second half of the course looks more closely at the contemporary period, focusing on the various \u2018crises\u2019 and transitions that have marked France during the past 20 years.

The course will offer insights and analyses on the different roles which are played by France and the United States on the issues of youth, women, and Modern Islam in the Arab World and on how their soft power is perceived by the Arab countries and their populations. By addressing the foreign policies that have been articulated in the region, we will also bring into light the dichotomy between the \u201cold\u201d and the \u201cnew\u201d diplomacy.

In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers.

Sample Syllabus                                                                     Internship Seminar Fieldwork - NODEP-UA 9982 or INDIV-UG 9350 - 4 points                               Enrollment by permission only. Application required.     This 4 credit course includes a weekly seminar and two full days and one half day (Monday-Friday) for their internship. Internship placements are made by EUSA, an organization partnering with NYU.     The seminar portion of the course explores many different aspects of your internship site. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization, including its approach, its policies, and the context in which it operates. We will also discuss more generally the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Finally, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience and as a way to refine your own personal and professional goals.

Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above).

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture. Taught in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.                                                                      Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

This course examines the rise of realist and impressionist art in Europe within its cultural, historical and social contexts. The novelty of these two important movements is considered in relation to preceding artistic movements, namely neo-classicism and romanticism. Works by artists such as Delacroix, Courbet, Millet, Manet, Monet, Renoir, Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec are studied. The course includes both class lectures with slides and museum visits.

In this course we explore the contemporary arts in France in their historic and social context. Beginning with current trends, we attempt to situate what\u2019s new within a longer tradition of artistic production. Themes studied include the nature of the object, the monochrome, the body, the idea of nature, personal mythologies, the importance of light. The course includes visits to contemporary galleries and museums. Conducted in French.                                                                    French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Special emphasis on the aesthetic and intellectual currents that have shaped French literature. Conducted in French.

Conducted in French.                                                                      Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.                                                                    French Society and Culture from the Middle-Ages to the Present -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09163 - 4 points                               This course approaches the study of French civilization from the medieval period to World War II through an exploration of fine arts, music, philosophy, literature, and history. A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage. Conducted in French.                                                                      Problems in Contemporary French Society -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09965 - 4 points                               The course aims to introduce students to contemporary French society through an examination of particular social groups and categories, with a focus on French youth and notions of gender. Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.                                                                    French-African Relations -\u00a0SCA-UA 9914 or HIST-UA 9510 - 4 points                               A historical and political inquiry into the French system of relations with Francophone Africa from the \u2018race to Empire\u2019 in the 19th century to the current day. The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.
