Tarleton Gillespie of Cornell University began the first panel with a presentation of his essay, \u201cThe Relevance of Algorithms.\u201d Gillespie explored various dimensions of \u201cpublic relevance algorithms\u201d \u2013 those algorithms that increasingly determine \u201crelevant\u201d information, \u201ca crucial feature of our participation in public life.\u201d Kate Crawford of the ILI, as well as of Microsoft Research/University of New South Wales responded with ten vignettes that illustrate the question of whether or not an algorithm can be \u201cagnostic.\u201d Martha Poon, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, responded with a discussion of commercial algorithms, noting different categories of algorithms that may be deployed for profit.   Frank Pasquale, then of Seton Hall Law and now at the University of Maryland Law School, presented \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Codes: Reputation and Search Algorithms in the Finance Sector.\u201d This work is related to Pasquale\u2019s forthcoming book, The Black Box Society: Technologies of Search, Reputation, and Finance (under contract with Harvard University Press).

Prior to orientation, materials will be made available to assist in orientation (e.g. schedules for medical record system training, manuals on the procedures and expectations for rotations).     All fellows are invited and expected to attend regularly-scheduled conferences which cover topics related to EEG, Epilepsy, EMG/NCS, Sleep, Evoked Potentials and Neuromuscular Disease. The latter are held every Thursday at noon. Conferences are prepared and given by faculty for both residents and fellows; in the latter half of the year, EMG-Track fellows will be expected to present case presentations and discussions, under attending physician supervision, for this conference.     All fellows are encouraged to attend the Multidisciplinary Conference (Tuesdays at 3:30) when on service at NYU Langone Medical Center, where patients being considered for surgery are presented to the CEC (including epileptologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and nursing). EEG-Track fellows are expected to attend immediately following outpatient clinic.     The Comprehensive Epilepsy Center provides a weekly didactic lecture series presented by faculty, visiting faculty and fellows (all EEG-Track fellows will present at this conference) at 8:00. Topics range from case presentations, reviews of epilepsy/EEG topics or research topics from visiting faculty. All fellows are invited to attend; fellows on service at NYU-Langone Medical Center are expected to attend.     EMG Journal club occurs monthly immediately following the last case of the day (typically Monday evening). All fellows prepare and review and article and the group then critically reviews all articles and identifies key teaching points and practice improvement methods based upon this review. Article choice is encouraged to be based upon recent clinical questions/problems that arose in the EMG/NCS laboratory.     All fellows have access to an electronic PDF library of selected EEG and epilepsy-related articles. In addition, instructional videos have been provided for review on general policy and procedures. These materials will be provided to fellows on a USB-drive for review at home as well. It is an excellent resource and fellows are highly encouraged to read the literature throughout their academic year. In addition, orientation material (video tutorials) is pre-loaded onto the drives. This instructional series takes fellows step-by-step through the mechanics of different rotation-dependent tasks, and has been developed to serve as a handy reference.     The research working groups have regular meetings on Wednesdays immediately following the morning lecture. Fellows with academic/research interests in a particular topic are encouraged to attend. These meetings vary from formal lectures on new data and reviews of related recently published literature from other groups to working meetings to discuss new projects or trouble-shoot ongoing projects. In addition, formal laboratory meetings for the research labs affiliated with the epilepsy center are routinely scheduled and fellows participating in research projects with these groups are encouraged to attend (schedule established annually).

Prior to orientation, materials will be made available to assist in orientation (e.g. schedules for medical record system training, manuals on the procedures and expectations for rotations).     All fellows are invited and expected to attend regularly-scheduled conferences which cover topics related to EEG, Epilepsy, EMG/NCS, Sleep, Evoked Potentials and Neuromuscular Disease. The latter are held every Thursday at noon. Conferences are prepared and given by faculty for both residents and fellows; in the latter half of the year, EMG-Track fellows will be expected to present case presentations and discussions, under attending physician supervision, for this conference.     All fellows are encouraged to attend the Multidisciplinary Conference (Tuesdays at 3:30) when on service at NYU Langone Medical Center, where patients being considered for surgery are presented to the CEC (including epileptologists, neurosurgeons, psychiatrists, neuropsychologists, and nursing). EEG-Track fellows are expected to attend immediately following outpatient clinic.     The Comprehensive Epilepsy Center provides a weekly didactic lecture series presented by faculty, visiting faculty and fellows (all EEG-Track fellows will present at this conference) at 8:00. Topics range from case presentations, reviews of epilepsy/EEG topics or research topics from visiting faculty. All fellows are invited to attend; fellows on service at NYU-Langone Medical Center are expected to attend.     EMG Journal club occurs monthly immediately following the last case of the day (typically Monday evening). All fellows prepare and review and article and the group then critically reviews all articles and identifies key teaching points and practice improvement methods based upon this review. Article choice is encouraged to be based upon recent clinical questions/problems that arose in the EMG/NCS laboratory.     All fellows have access to an electronic PDF library of selected EEG and epilepsy-related articles. In addition, instructional videos have been provided for review on general policy and procedures. These materials will be provided to fellows on a USB-drive for review at home as well. It is an excellent resource and fellows are highly encouraged to read the literature throughout their academic year. In addition, orientation material (video tutorials) is pre-loaded onto the drives. This instructional series takes fellows step-by-step through the mechanics of different rotation-dependent tasks, and has been developed to serve as a handy reference.     The research working groups have regular meetings on Wednesdays immediately following the morning lecture. Fellows with academic/research interests in a particular topic are encouraged to attend. These meetings vary from formal lectures on new data and reviews of related recently published literature from other groups to working meetings to discuss new projects or trouble-shoot ongoing projects. In addition, formal laboratory meetings for the research labs affiliated with the epilepsy center are routinely scheduled and fellows participating in research projects with these groups are encouraged to attend (schedule established annually).

Registration is required at the following link: www.surveymonkey.com/s/ACRIAHIGNConference   Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV from a fatal disease into a chronic condition. People are living near-normal life spans-50% of the NYC HIV infected population is age 50 and older. Those numbers are growing. This good news is complicated by evidence which that these older adults are developing the comorbidities of aging 10-20 years earlier than expected. This complication requires that health care delivery respond by using integrated care models.   Who should attend: Providers, Faculty, Students, Social Workers and Clients.   Event is FREE! But seats are limited. Breakfast and Lunch will be provided.   Nursing Continuing Education is available through the NYU College of Nursing.   The NYU College of Nursing Center for Continuing Education in Nursing is accredited as a provider of continuing nursing education by the American Nurses' Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation   For more information contact LSeidel@acria.org.
