Set in the heart of Brooklyn\u2019s     Tech Triangle, the urban learning space is made global at NYU\u2019s School     of Engineering. The moment for engineering is now . Learn more about     our place at the epicenter of invention, innovation, and     entrepreneurship through each of these interactive stories. Engineering is NYU .                                          Engineering is creative                                   Our students are artists, engineers, and entrepreneurs working in      extraordinarily challenging and fluid industries that reward the       creative and the innovative . The yearly Inno/Vention competition gives      students the opportunity to prototype and pitch their ideas      to professors and industry experts who mentor them and help turn their      concepts into realities. The new MAGNET       facility brings together four NYU schools in order to bridge the gap between the Arts, Education,      Engineering and Math and create unusual collaborations . The Game Innovation Lab       helps move gaming from purely entertainment to educational and aids in the expansion       of a burgeoning economic sector in New York.

We equip our faculty and students with      tools and resources as they move their inspiration into the      applications domain. We are mobile because NYU has a successful track      record of providing bona fide paths for creative students to the      middle class and beyond, and will continue to foster upward mobility:      forty percent of our students are the first in their families to      attend college and we were recently voted #3 among all schools by       PayScale 2013 College Return On Investment Report .       We are mobile also because we are global. Mobility is not just about taking you upward; it is about taking everyone along as well.

Its drive to push the      boundaries of what it means to be a 21st century research institution,      grounded on the principles of invention, innovation, and      entrepreneurship, has and will continue to lead to new strides. The      addition of the School of Engineering to the robust academic offerings      at NYU will aid in the creation of a more enlightened community that      is literate and technologically savvy at the same time.                                             \u201c We create new knowledge for the future and turn it into       wisdom through experience. We are equally aware of our responsibility       to solve the problems of today, so we can be active partners in the       growth and success of our local community, New York and, eventually,       the world.\u201d              Katepalli R.
