Education and Social Policy Faculty Members Publish \"Not Just for Poor Kids: The Impact of Universal Free School Breakfast on Meal Participation and Student Outcomes\"    Education and Social Policy Faculty Member, Sean Corcoran, Publishes Paper on School Choices and Placements of Low-Achieving Students       Program Description    The M.A. program in Education and Social Policy addresses the growing demand for professionals who can use up-to-date methods, data, and research results to formulate, implement, and evaluate education policies, ranging from the national No Child Left Behind Act to local or state policies such as New York City's Children First initiative. As the national and international concern with the quality of education grows, local, state and federal education agencies, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations are seeking individuals with the skills and knowledge to help craft education reforms that improve the effectiveness and fairness of educational outcomes.    Based in the social science disciplines of economics and sociology , the program teaches you to use statistics, large datasets, and research designs to analyze education policies for grades K-12 and higher education.     The curriculum is designed to assure that you master appropriate analytical methods as well as develop knowledge of issues in a specific education policy area, such as higher education, race and class, international education, or K-12 education issues. No previous knowledge of education policy or statistics is required.    The degree is distinguished from other master&rsquo;s degrees in education policy by its strong emphasis on using quantitative methods to ascertain causal effects of programs and policies. You begin your studies with a first course in statistics and progress through more rigorous analytical courses, including regression and econometrics. The sequence of methods courses culminates in a final directed group research project in which groups produce a professional study of an educational intervention or policy of their choosing.    Throughout the course of study, you gain experience:       in working with large longitudinal education databases    with using economic and sociological principles to analyze K-16 education, and    with principles of management, planning, and policy making in the public and nonprofit sectors, which draw on the expertise of faculty in NYU&rsquo;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service .       The curriculum places a strong emphasis on understanding the context, purpose, unintended effects, and finally the actual impact of alternative education policies and programs. You will use elective choices, which you&rsquo;ll choose in consultation with your adviser, to gain knowledge of policy issues.    Students gain experience through the required Capstone course, as well, where they work in teams to design and perform a research study. Projects are designed and written for a particular &ldquo;clientele&rdquo; in the policy community. Throughout the tenure of their capstone project, students are expected to consult with faculty who have relevant expertise in appropriate fields of research specialization. See right for an example of a capstone poster.    Graduates are prepared to work in a wide variety of organizations that have a role in policymaking and implementation in the education area, including local, state and federal education departments, foundations, think tanks, and consulting, grant-giving and public-relations departments in selected private organizations. Students in the Education and Social Policy program learn about education policy in New York City--one of the best urban laboratories in the nation. Through this experience, alumni of the Education and Social Policy program are prepared to work in education policy throughout the country, and even in major cities in other nations like China and Japan.    View and download our PDF Brochure to learn more about the Education and Social Policy Program.     Mission Statement    The M.A. program in Education and Social Policy prepares graduates to become professionals who use statistics, large datasets, and research designs to formulate and evaluate education policies in grades kindergarten through twelve and higher education.    The program provides an opportunity to specialize in specific areas of education policy, such as higher education, race and class, international education, or K-12 education issues.    Student Learning Objectives       Students will apply principles of economics and sociology to formulate and analyze K-12 and higher education policies.    Students will conduct descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using large longitudinal education databases to interpret and identify causal effects of programs and policies and to apply conclusions to make policy recommendations.    Students will understand the policies already implemented as well as needs for additional policies in their chosen areas. They will be able to participate in quantitative studies to further evaluate existing policies and to provide evidence on the possible effects of new policies.       Other Options to Study Education and Policy in Steinhardt    In addition to the M.A. Program in Education and Social Policy, the Steinhardt School offers students two other options to study education and policy and to prepare for a career in this field. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.

Additionally, students go abroad as part of their major via school-specific curriculum.        Graduate program offerings include TischAsia , the NYU Law in Singapore program, master\u2019s programs at some of the 10 main global sites, and study abroad and research opportunities through our direct exchange partner institutions.   Summer session programs are offered by NYU\u2019s various schools and departments for both graduate and undergraduate students. Summer program locations are as diverse as Beijing and Shanghai, Barcelona and Dublin. Some programs, such as Journalism in Ghana, Filmmaking in Prague, and Urban Design in London, are major-specific, while others, such as the offerings in Athens, Florence, and Paris, are formulated to blend together different disciplines into a single avenue of knowledge.                             Discover NYU in Buenos Aires         Intersession program offerings arise through the various schools, colleges, and programs during winter and summer intersessions, often focusing on specific research or service projects. For example, Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholars took a January intersession trip to Peru, where they lived with host families and helped tackle health and ecological issues by installing clean-burning stoves, building bathrooms at schools, and planting trees. Silver School of Social Work students regularly travel to Tanzania during their winter and summer breaks in order to work at the Tanzania Children's Rescue Center, a safe haven for children founded by an NYU undergraduate.        Direct exchange programs with partner institutions allow students to retain matriculation while earning NYU credit at distinguished research universities around the globe. The NYU International Exchange Program provides students with a variety of academic venues and structures that enables independent students to immerse themselves in a culture while studying with leading scholars at some of the world\u2019s best universities.   Lectures, seminars, conferences, and events are scheduled throughout the year\u2014 around the world. At the NYU Abu Dhabi Institute, a speaker series called Conversations with Authors featured lectures on topics from the U.S. presidential election to the cosmology of Stephen Hawking.   NYU in Buenos Aires hosts a series of guest lectures each semester that helps students develop a better understanding of Argentine and Latin American culture through the arts, politics, and heritage.   A full conference center at NYU in Florence hosts international academic conferences that have included the Mediterranean diet, transatlantic conversations on Italian art, and the philosophy of mind.   At NYU in Prague , the Prague Insititute for Democracy, Economy, and Culture sponsors an annual conference that students help to organize and through which they network with experts including anthropologists, architects, and political leaders. Each site sponsors its own activities, which together provide an impressive calendar of events and opportunities.                                  All Kinds of Opportunities   At NYU\u2019s many international locations and through associations with partner institutions, a full range of globally oriented programming occurs around the world. Students and faculty take advantage of all kinds of opportunities\u2014from study abroad programs to school-sponsored research experiences, from curriculum-driven degree programming to global community service projects, from lectures and seminars on the many campuses to cyber classes that connect students at various sites by web video for shared lectures. The range of global programming continues to expand with NYU\u2019s growth as a Global Network University.        A Global Network University   Every year, students pack their bags and leave home in pursuit of a dream: to live and study at New York University. NYU, one of the foremost private, global research institutions in the United States, is primarily located in the heart of downtown Manhattan. Over 160 undergraduate programs of study that match almost every professional interest are offered here. Beyond NYU's Washington Square campus in Greenwich Village lies a whole world of NYU opportunity. As a student in a global network university with a portal campus in Abu Dhabi and 10 international academic centers, you're able to make progress toward your degree on five continents\u2014Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. You broaden the scope of your education through study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming. Around the world, you'll continue to work closely with faculty and fellow students who share your commitment, you'll apply what you've learned, and you'll develop the skills and qualities-both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world around you.
