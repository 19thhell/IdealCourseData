This new curriculum has led to many changes. Those that most impact the Department will be reviewed here.   The medical school curriculum paradigm suggested by Flexner more than 100 years ago established the framework which provided for two years of basic science study followed by two years of clinical experience. NYU, along with many other medical schools, is now shifting away from this system to one that includes a shorter \"preclinical\" period, early exposure to clinical medicine, interdisciplinary education, and a greater period of time after the core clerkships to allow for dual degrees and meaningful research. While some changes are minor, others have been more drastic.   Implementation of C21 is ongoing. The greatest changes have already occurred in the first 18 months of medical school curriculum. Faculty in Foundations of Medicine and Practice of Medicine (POM) simultaneously taught two classes of medical students while restructuring the curriculum. The first class to participate in the new curriculum, the class of 2014, joined the class of 2013 on the wards for clerkships in January of 2012. This overlap period will last until July 2012 and continues to require a tremendous commitment from the faculty. Integration will be complete after the 2013-14 academic year.   Students will also have four ongoing educational exercises called pillars that span the four years of medical school. These pillars include common diseases and disease processes and include colon cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and tuberculosis. The Department of Medicine holds leadership positions in all four pillars.   The new curriculum also provides several new interdepartmental electives from which students may choose. More rigorous than traditional electives, these \"Selectives\" allow students to focus on relevant and important topics within medicine. The Department has had a key role in the development of four Selectives: Cardiovascular Disease, Palliative Care, Global Health, and Health Policy. The new curriculum will also allow students to concentrate on an area of interest including research during the final 18 months of medical school. Both Health Policy and Global Health will be offered as a Concentration starting in 2013.   C21 will also affect the clerkships. Instead of eight 8-week Medicine Clerkship blocks, the clerkship has been combined with Ambulatory Care for a total of four 12-week blocks. When fully implemented, students will benefit from a full 12 consecutive weeks of medicine in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Between the 12-week blocks, the Office of Medical Education has also added a one week \"intersession\" that will allow students to examine cross-cutting interdepartmental topics. Dr. Melanie Jay from the Department of Medicine has played an important role in developing intersession content.   The Department of Medicine is dedicated to the success of C21 and our students. While the timing and specific content of the curriculum may change, we will continue to train clinician-scientists who are ready to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Our goal is to produce individuals who will maintain a life-long commitment to practice medicine with compassion, intellectual discipline, lifelong curiosity, and rigorous professionalism.

This new curriculum has led to many changes. Those that most impact the Department will be reviewed here.   The medical school curriculum paradigm suggested by Flexner more than 100 years ago established the framework which provided for two years of basic science study followed by two years of clinical experience. NYU, along with many other medical schools, is now shifting away from this system to one that includes a shorter \"preclinical\" period, early exposure to clinical medicine, interdisciplinary education, and a greater period of time after the core clerkships to allow for dual degrees and meaningful research. While some changes are minor, others have been more drastic.   Implementation of C21 is ongoing. The greatest changes have already occurred in the first 18 months of medical school curriculum. Faculty in Foundations of Medicine and Practice of Medicine (POM) simultaneously taught two classes of medical students while restructuring the curriculum. The first class to participate in the new curriculum, the class of 2014, joined the class of 2013 on the wards for clerkships in January of 2012. This overlap period will last until July 2012 and continues to require a tremendous commitment from the faculty. Integration will be complete after the 2013-14 academic year.   Students will also have four ongoing educational exercises called pillars that span the four years of medical school. These pillars include common diseases and disease processes and include colon cancer, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and tuberculosis. The Department of Medicine holds leadership positions in all four pillars.   The new curriculum also provides several new interdepartmental electives from which students may choose. More rigorous than traditional electives, these \"Selectives\" allow students to focus on relevant and important topics within medicine. The Department has had a key role in the development of four Selectives: Cardiovascular Disease, Palliative Care, Global Health, and Health Policy. The new curriculum will also allow students to concentrate on an area of interest including research during the final 18 months of medical school. Both Health Policy and Global Health will be offered as a Concentration starting in 2013.   C21 will also affect the clerkships. Instead of eight 8-week Medicine Clerkship blocks, the clerkship has been combined with Ambulatory Care for a total of four 12-week blocks. When fully implemented, students will benefit from a full 12 consecutive weeks of medicine in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Between the 12-week blocks, the Office of Medical Education has also added a one week \"intersession\" that will allow students to examine cross-cutting interdepartmental topics. Dr. Melanie Jay from the Department of Medicine has played an important role in developing intersession content.   The Department of Medicine is dedicated to the success of C21 and our students. While the timing and specific content of the curriculum may change, we will continue to train clinician-scientists who are ready to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Our goal is to produce individuals who will maintain a life-long commitment to practice medicine with compassion, intellectual discipline, lifelong curiosity, and rigorous professionalism.
