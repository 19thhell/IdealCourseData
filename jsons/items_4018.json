The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.      Extensive Sequence    Elementary German I GERM-UA 1 Open only to students with no previous training in German; others require permission of the department. Offered every semester. 4 points.

Postintermediate Courses in Language, Culture, and Literature (100 Level)    These are \"bridge\" courses between basic language study and more advanced courses. The common goal of courses at this level is to consolidate students' command of spoken and written German, to review advanced structures of the language, and to provide core information that will be needed in advanced study of literature and culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All courses at this level are conducted in German. All German courses at the 100 level require successful completion of GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20, or permission of the department.

The works of Austrian writers, artists, architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama), film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl.

Techniques of Translation GERM-UA 153 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation firsthand, students encounter diverse grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. Also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression.       Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in English (200 Level)    Courses at the 200 level are conducted in English. Literature-oriented courses at this level may count in fulfillment of the College's minor in literature in translation. Many of these courses are cross-listed with other NYU departments or programs. No knowledge of German is required for courses at this level, and there are no prerequisites.    Introduction to German Culture GERM-UA 220 Offered periodically. 4 points. German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence on the history of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing students with some of the most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche; the music of Mozart and Wagner; the literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht; as well as the art movements of dada and Bauhaus all serve as the basis for a discussion of the complex constellation of \"kultur,\" politics, and power in the German intellectual tradition.    Marx, Nietzsche, Freud GERM-UA 240 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the work of these three seminal authors by focusing on their notions of interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art.

Focuses on the emergence of mass culture and shows how the modernist and avant-garde movements question the very institution of art in work. Materials include works of literature, theory, film, and the visual arts.    Madness and Genius GERM-UA 285 Offered periodically. 4 points. Explores the relationship among talent, inspiration, and psychological instability in works of the 19th and 20th centuries. Considers the link between inspiration and possession, Western culture's valorization of originality, the political purpose of characterizing originality as psychologically transgressive, and the allegorization of the creative process through depictions of madness.    Topics in 19th-Century Literature GERM-UA 297 Identical to COLIT-UA 180. Offered periodically. 4 points.    Topics in 20th-Century Literature GERM-UA 298 Offered periodically. 4 points.      Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in German (300 Level)    Courses at this level provide a broad historical overview of specific periods in German literary and cultural development. Advanced German language skills are practiced, with particular emphasis on the ability to summarize and on the expression of supported opinion. Students read more texts of greater linguistic and conceptual complexity than those used at the 100 level, although readings consist primarily of short works and excerpts. Readings are drawn from literary and nonliterary sources.    It is recommended that students complete GERM-UA 152 or the equivalent before enrolling in courses at the 300 level.    Romanticism GERM-UA 349 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Traces the development of romanticism in Germany in the period 1789-1830.

Study of German prose and drama from the end of romanticism to the development of expressionism before the turn of the century. Selected texts deal with poetic realism, the rise of new literary forms leading to naturalism, and Austrian and German manifestations of impressionism and expressionism.    20th-Century German Prose GERM-UA 366 Offered periodically. 4 points. Investigates significant prose texts of German-language authors from 1900 to the present. Genres discussed include the short story, the novella, and the novel.    Post-1945 German Literature GERM-UA 369 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines works by some of the major German-language writers in the decades following World War II.

Course focuses on 19th-century German literature by examining various intersections between cultural, social, and scientific discourse. Study of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a focus on form, genre, and narrativity.     Advanced Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)    These courses examine authors, groups of works, and intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.    Goethe GERM-UA 455 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose, poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond.    The Age of Goethe GERM-UA 456 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and of classicism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the central, but not the only significant, literary figure. Readings include Herder, Von der Urpoesie der V\u00f6lker and selected poems; Lenz, Die Soldaten; Schiller, Die R\u00e4uber, Kabale und Liebe, Maria Stuart, and selected poems; and H\u00f6lderlin, selected poems.

Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points.

The fundamental concepts of literary studies have  been instituted and destituted via his figure, beginning with such notions as  \u201cauthor,\u201d \u201cinfluence,\u201d \u201ccanon.\u201d In this seminar, we will trace different  (re-)negotiations of Shakespeare as a point of entry for exploring the history  and the foundations of literary studies. From the first debates about  Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cgenius\u201d and the very idea of \u201cauthorship,\u201d through celebrations  and anxieties of (his) influence, to attempts to establish and to undo a canon  of classical literary texts, the \u201ccase\u201d of Shakespeare offers a unique look  into the laboratory of the Romantic project that has become \u201cliterary studies.\u201d  The course will spend the first four weeks (taught in English by Elisabeth  Bronfen) focusing on Hamlet , Henry V , and Measure for Measure , followed by a ten-week itinerary (in English  and German) through mainly German debates, adaptations, translations, and  reconfigurations of Shakespeare. Readings by Lessing, Herder, Goethe, the  Schlegel brothers through Carl Schmitt. Taught mainly in English; German  readings skills required. Please contact cfrey@nyu.edu   if you would like to participate in only one part of the seminar.  GERM-GA1842 (DRAP-GA1842/COLIT-GA3612) W 6:20 \u2013 8:20 Nietzsche\u2019s Impact on 20th Century Thought Friedrich Ulfers The objective of the seminar is to show how Nietzsche revolutionized  Western philosophy by transforming its dualistic-metaphysical worldview into a  holistic one that corresponds to the reality of the world as one interrelated,  processual whole. It will also show how this transformation influenced  significantly what is known as \u201cContinental Philosophy,\u201d which includes such  figures as Heidegger, Derrida, and Deleuze. Particular attention will be paid to the meaning of Nietzsche\u2019s pronouncement  that \u201cGod is dead\u201d; his declaration that the world is \u201cWill to Power \u201d and an  \u201caesthetic phenomenon\u201d; and his idea of \u201cEternal Recurrence.\u201d Also discussed  will be the role language plays in Nietzsche\u2019s view on epistemology and  ontology, his revaluation of morality, and his influence on the arts. GERM-GA2601 (COLIT-GA1122) W 3:30 \u2013 6:10 (supplemental meetings: 10/9 &amp; 10/16) Topics in 19th Century Culture: Biological Careers: Narration and  Life-Science in the German 19th Century Leif Weatherby &amp; Featuring Slavoj \u017di\u017eek Literature and life stand in a privileged relationship. The governance of life  and lives in the lab and at the level of the individual and the population was  the obsession of the nineteenth century, and formed a backbone of narrative  experiment and ambition. Literature not only reflected but constituted new  modes of curating the living in a world newly mediated by laboratory science  and its technologies. This course interrogates this conjuncture by  triangulating narrative theory (from Blankenburg to Luk\u00e0cs), narrative (from  Goethe to D\u00f6blin), and the life sciences (from Brown to Uexk\u00fcll). Central to  our analysis will be the differentiation between biographical and biological  life, even as our period of study will see the break between the humanities and  the natural sciences. Starting with Goethe, Kant, and Schelling, we will study  Hoffmann and the \"night side\" of natural science, Gotthelf and the  epidemic, Storm and post-Darwinian materialism, and Modernist epic with the  emergence of radical biology and early sociology, among others. Conducted in English. Tentative readings include: G.W.F. Hegel, Lectures on Aesthetics Georg Luk\u00e0cs, Theory of the Novel Goethe, Metamorphosis of Plants ; Wilhelm Meister's Years of  Apprenticeship Kant, Critique of the Power of Judgment John Brown, Elements of Medicine Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Science of Knowledge Schelling, First Outline of a System of the Philosophy of Nature Hoffmann, stories from the Serapion Brethren Johannes M\u00fcller, Elements of Physiology Wilhelm Dilthey, Introduction to the Human Sciences Jeremias Gotthelf, The Black Spider Ernst Haeckel, The Riddle of the Universe Hermann Lotze, Microcosmus Theodor Storm, The Rider on the White Horse Sigmund Freud, Project for a Scientific Psychology Georg Simmel, The Metropolis and Mental Life Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Theoretical Biology Alfred D\u00f6blin, Berlin Alexanderplatz Slavoj \u017di\u017eek: HOW TO BE A MATERIALIST TODAY The entire history of philosophy turns around the line that separates truth  from falsity - from Plato whose focus is the line that divides truth from mere  opinion, up to Lenin obsessed with the line that separates materialism from  idealism. The course will be an exercise in this art of delimitation: its aim  is to specify the contours of the dialectical-materialist ontology by way of  drawing a line that separates from it from other forms of thought that appear  similar to it, from Julia Kristeva\u2019s abjection to Robert Pippin\u2019s  self-consciousness, from Catherine Malabou\u2019s plasticity to the god of negative  theology, from object-oriented-ontology to the topic of post-humanity. --1 Negativity in materialist theology: is god dead, unconscious, evil, or  plainly stupid? --2 A critique of object-oriented-ontology and New Materialism. --3 Abject, ugliness, disgust: a delimitation from Kristeva. --4 Hegel and the end of art: a materialist delimitation from Pippin.

The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.

Postintermediate Courses in Language, Culture, and Literature (100 Level)    These are \"bridge\" courses between basic language study and more advanced courses. The common goal of courses at this level is to consolidate students' command of spoken and written German, to review advanced structures of the language, and to provide core information that will be needed in advanced study of literature and culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All courses at this level are conducted in German. All German courses at the 100 level require successful completion of GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20, or permission of the department.

While engaging in the craft of translation firsthand, students encounter diverse grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. Also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression.       Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in English (200 Level)    Courses at the 200 level are conducted in English. Literature-oriented courses at this level may count in fulfillment of the College's minor in literature in translation. Many of these courses are cross-listed with other NYU departments or programs. No knowledge of German is required for courses at this level, and there are no prerequisites.    Introduction to German Culture GERM-UA 220 Offered periodically. 4 points. German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence on the history of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing students with some of the most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche; the music of Mozart and Wagner; the literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht; as well as the art movements of dada and Bauhaus all serve as the basis for a discussion of the complex constellation of \"kultur,\" politics, and power in the German intellectual tradition.    Marx, Nietzsche, Freud GERM-UA 240 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the work of these three seminal authors by focusing on their notions of interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art.

Course focuses on 19th-century German literature by examining various intersections between cultural, social, and scientific discourse. Study of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a focus on form, genre, and narrativity.     Advanced Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)    These courses examine authors, groups of works, and intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.    Goethe GERM-UA 455 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose, poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond.    The Age of Goethe GERM-UA 456 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and of classicism.

Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points.

This course introduces students to the genre through readings of representative  novellas, demonstrating how the genre is often the home of supernatural events  such as demonic possession or a plague of spiders that materialize from  nowhere. Given that the novella is also the genre most closely associated with  literary realism, we will focus mainly on the 19th century and the relation  between the novella\u2019s strange status as bearer of the unexplainable and the era  of realism\u2019s taxonomic project of assembling and depicting data about the world  in an effort to produce coherence.

The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war,  rapid industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the  political and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the  very bedrock upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to  this pervasive sense of upheaval and angst , as well as  the challenges and changes themselves, form the focus of this course, as we  explore the relationship between modernity and crisis in early  twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will include Nietzsche, Freud,  Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger. Taught in English.  GERM-UA249   (COLIT-UA249) T, R 2:00  \u2013 3:15  Introduction to  Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques    Chadwick Smith  This course presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the  perspective of the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social  thought and forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by  four movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The  boom in aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one  still based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world. Taught in English.  GERM-UA377         M,  W 2:00 \u2013 3:15   Modern  German Drama: Theaters of War (Goethe to Brecht)  Christiane  Frey    When  military strategists speak of a \u201ctheater of operations,\u201d or when the  nineteenth-century war theorist Carl von Clausewitz coins the term \u201ctheater of  war,\u201d they are not just using an empty metaphor: we think of war as a kind of  drama played out within a bounded area over a certain period of time. It\u2019s thus  no accident that authors have turned to drama as a genre on which to reflect on  war \u2013 its dynamics, its causes, its seeming inevitability, its consequences,  its mediality. In this course, we will explore how theater stages war and  terror, beginning with plays written shortly before or after the French  Revolution \u2013 whose \u201creign of terror\u201d gave us our concept of \u201cterrorism\u201d \u2013 to 20th-century  modernist and experimental dramas of war. We will also explore various theoretical  approaches to war and terror. Plays by Goethe, Kleist, B\u00fcchner, Brecht, Peter  Weiss, Heiner M\u00fcller; theoretical writings by Clausewitz, Carl Schmitt, Freud,  Paul Virilio, and Friedrich Kittler. Requirements: oral presentation, take home  exam, three short papers.  *This course will be  conducted in German.
