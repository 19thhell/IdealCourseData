Green is consistently used as a symbolism of life- from Walt diving into the meth world in the pilot, to killing his arch nemisis in the finale, his life is certainly not boring. The producers most likely brought back the green shirt in order to bring closure to the show, in case there wouldn't be a fifth season (there will be though).           Viewers will recall the pink bear from season two . Walter, who is always wearing green and beiges, sports a pink sweater in the season two finale when his daughter is born. This symoblizes him regaining his life. This, however, is short-lived and down comes the half burnt pink bear from the aircraft crash and into Walt's pool with Walt looking on, indicating that he's \"drowning\". The bottom image shows Gus Fringe right before he dies. The image was clearly designed to replicate the teddy bear, missing eye and all. Gus for most of the show seemed indestructable and incapable of dying, similar to how a pink bear wouldn't seem like it could represent hopelessness.          A reoccuring symbol in the show is the number \"8\". 8 symbolizes eternity and self destruction. This undoubtly relates to Breaking Bad on many levels. First of all, the clearly marked 8 bruise on Jesse's face indicates self destruction. The first person he kills on this show, innocent Gale, was the eigth person on the show to die as a result of Walt and Jesse's partenership. The sideways eight in the sky can be argued to stand for infinity. This scene shows Jesse, Gus and Mike heading to Mexico to give the cartel Walt's recipe. Thus, the drug trade is neverending. There will be rises and falls of drug lords, new entrants, and deaths.            The back story of this scene is that when Walt worked for Gus, he was given a quirky lab assistant, Gale. Walt had him fired because he needed Jesse to work for him because he felt guilty for what his brother in law, Hank, did to Jesse. However, an unfortunate turn of events took turn and Jesse's life was on the line. So Walt was given a new assistant at Gus's choosing. The SIGNS logo above the car with the unusual bike on the top symbolizes Gale's return.          Home"}]}]
