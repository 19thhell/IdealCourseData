CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

We schedule individual appointments and provide students with personalized feedback regarding their use, with a focus on helping students make safe and healthy decisions for themselves.   The SAFE program also offers the following group counseling opportunities for NYU students:     Substance Use: Choices and Change  This group creates the opportunity for students to discuss concerns about their substance use, identify motivations and triggers, and consider making changes in their behavior.   Sons and Daughters of Alcohol and Substance Users  A group for students with a parent who abuses or has abused alcohol or other drugs. The group offers students the opportunity to gain the support of peers, to better understand the effects of parental substance use on their development, and to develop strategies for coping with parental substance abuse if it is still active.     In addition, the SAFE program will help students connect with resources outside the university as needed, including treatment programs and support groups.   To make an appointment, call the main number for Counseling and Wellness Serivces at 212-998-4780, or come in during walk-in hours.

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

We schedule individual appointments and provide students with personalized feedback regarding their use, with a focus on helping students make safe and healthy decisions for themselves.   The SAFE program also offers the following group counseling opportunities for NYU students:     Substance Use: Choices and Change  This group creates the opportunity for students to discuss concerns about their substance use, identify motivations and triggers, and consider making changes in their behavior.   Sons and Daughters of Alcohol and Substance Users  A group for students with a parent who abuses or has abused alcohol or other drugs. The group offers students the opportunity to gain the support of peers, to better understand the effects of parental substance use on their development, and to develop strategies for coping with parental substance abuse if it is still active.     In addition, the SAFE program will help students connect with resources outside the university as needed, including treatment programs and support groups.   To make an appointment, call the main number for Counseling and Wellness Serivces at 212-998-4780, or come in during walk-in hours.

CWS offers students short-term individual counseling, group counseling, self-improvement classes, referrals, and psychiatric medication services. All services except psychiatric medication services are free of charge.   Short-term Counseling   Counseling - or psychotherapy - is a professional relationship that focuses on personal problems. The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems.   CWS counselors are psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, nurse practitioners, and advanced trainees in those professions. There are male and female counselors, counselors from different racial and national backgrounds, and counselors who specialize in substance abuse, gay/lesbian/bisexual concerns, eating disorders, international students, and other concerns. We also have counselors who specialize in the issues of students from different schools: CAS, Gallatin, Law, Social Work, Steinhardt, Tisch, and students living in residence halls.   Length of counseling varies. Some problems lend themselves to a one or two session consultation. Others require a series of appointments, the length to be decided by you and your counselor. If you need longer than short-term counseling, your counselor will discuss with you affordable referral resources in the community.   Many problems lend themselves to Group Counseling or a Toolkit , rather than individual counseling.   What kind of problem is appropriate to discuss with a CWS counselor? Anything that troubles you. Here is a partial list of common student concerns:     Depression   Homesickness   Stress   Anxiety   Alcohol or drugs   Eating concerns   Academic anxieties   Roommate and friendship problems   Family problems   Suicidal thoughts   Sexual concerns   Identity concerns     Confidentiality                                Quick Links                      Counseling Services           Counseling Counseling by Appointment Group Counseling Psychiatry Relaxation Oasis Substance, Assessment, Feedback, and Evalution Toolkits Walk-in Counseling                                                                                                                                                           Counseling and Wellness   Contact Information     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 471   Telephone: 212-998-4780   Fax: 212-995-4096   wellness.exchange@nyu.edu   By Appointment :*   Mon-Thu: 9am-8pm   Fri: 9am-5pm   Sat-Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)     --------------------------   Walk-in Counseling : *   (No appointment necessary)     726 Broadway, 4th Floor, Suite 402  (3rd Floor, Suit 353 on Saturdays)     Mon-Thu: 10am-8:30pm   (Short-term refills available 5-8pm)   Fri: 10am-6pm   (Short-term refills available 3-5pm)   Sat: 10am-3pm (3rd Fl, Ste 353)   Sun: Closed (Call 212-443-9999)   --------------------------   Polytechnic School of Engineering Counseling Services   5 Metrotech, Suite 232  Brooklyn, NY   Telephone: 718-260-3456                                  Staff Directory                  Learn about our Providers.

We schedule individual appointments and provide students with personalized feedback regarding their use, with a focus on helping students make safe and healthy decisions for themselves.   The SAFE program also offers the following group counseling opportunities for NYU students:     Substance Use: Choices and Change  This group creates the opportunity for students to discuss concerns about their substance use, identify motivations and triggers, and consider making changes in their behavior.   Sons and Daughters of Alcohol and Substance Users  A group for students with a parent who abuses or has abused alcohol or other drugs. The group offers students the opportunity to gain the support of peers, to better understand the effects of parental substance use on their development, and to develop strategies for coping with parental substance abuse if it is still active.     In addition, the SAFE program will help students connect with resources outside the university as needed, including treatment programs and support groups.   To make an appointment, call the main number for Counseling and Wellness Serivces at 212-998-4780, or come in during walk-in hours.
