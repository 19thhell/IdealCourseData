Indeed, if it isn't distinctive, then it isn't a style. A creative person is someone who imagines what other people cannot. Their value to us lies in expanding our own possibilities. Walls fall. We break out. Art releases what was lost. Jeanette Winterson          Sometimes it seems that our lives have been watered down. That somehow we have been cheated of the true meaning of what is before us. Especially here in America, millions of people live comfortable lifestyles: they have money, they have place, they have success. But still many of us are bored and unhappy. We wake up every morning, go to work, go to school, and come home without feeling a thing. We are de facto disenchanted and nobody really knows why. Our imagination dies long before our bodies die.          Jeanette Winterson is a writer whose work seems to be aimed at changing this for herself and, if we will listen to her, perhaps for us as well. Winterson reveals both the beauty and the horror with which we are confronted on a daily basis. She shows us new universes within our own, and parallel universes outside our own. Her writing teaches us to read between the lines of our everyday lives. Even when this is not an obvious message delivered through the content of her stories, we find it within her language. Her words reveal and unfold layers of unrealized meaning on every page, until the reader is gently lowered back into his or her own world with a new fascination and awe for what already existed.          Winterson's writing rejects our conventional perception of life. She reveals the shallow fulfillment inherent in traditional values, expands our notion of time and reality, and gives us new insight on our existing realities. This is not only apparent through the content of Winterson's stories but also through her use of unusual and varied narrative structures. Winterson's work is deeply creative; she is constantly moving between territories which seem to be uncharted and new, and she never seems to write the same way twice. Thus her characters' refusal to accept the conventional means of living are paralleled by her own refusal to abide by the conventional means of storytelling. Winterson wants us to read and live beyond convention, as she writes and her characters live.          On a literal level, nearly all of Jeanette Winterson's writing contains some sort of rejection of traditional values or societal norms. The story &quot;Newton,&quot; from The World and Other Places portrays a distorted world in which traditional ideas and values are exaggerated to the point of domination. These ideas are rejected by Winterson through the character Tom, who is &quot;the stranger&quot; in his world (163). Much like Camus' character in L'Etranger, to whom Winterson alludes, Tom is an unconventional character who is not a typical member of his society. Tom escapes from his hometown, Newton, which represents an exaggerated societal ideal, and in the end he says that unlike the other inhabitants, his &quot;hills are ripe, and the water leaps at [his] throat . . .&quot; (175). With this one sentence , Winterson cleverly reveals the reward of enchantment found by Tom through his rejection of convention. This is mirrored in numerous other characters throughout The World And Other Places. In &quot;The Green Square,&quot; a character does not physically leave the society with which she grapples, but instead discovers that it is essential to her life that she &quot;find, everyday, a green square to walk in&quot;(203). The &quot;green square&quot; represent the character's realization of the beauty in the mundane aspects of her life. Although the stories present seemingly different realities, one might view them as a portrayal of the same character from two different perspectives. &quot;Newton&quot; possesses a fairy tale-like quality, beginning with the familiarly simple line &quot;This is the story of Tom,&quot; (163) while &quot;The Green Square&quot; is not far out of the conventional contemporary idiom, but both stories portray traditional values as boundaries standing between a character and his or her undiscovered love for everyday life. Another story, which possesses a mythic and allegorical quality, &quot;The Three Friends&quot; uses the metaphor of a floorless house to represent traditional values. The three characters who set out in search of &quot;that which cannot be found,&quot; first reach a &quot;house that celebrated ceilings and denied floors&quot; which offers them gold (49). The house represents the backwards and contradictory values of our society: value of material goods over more necessary things, and the placement of boundaries where no floor exists, so to speak. Throughout the story, the friends amass many material goods and conventional successes, but none of these end their search. The pursuit of material goods ultimately becomes the pursuit of &quot;that which cannot be found.&quot; Thus Winterson portrays the material values of society as unattainable goals without real fulfillment, whilst suggesting a &quot;green square to walk in&quot; as a true necessity-the foundation necessary for real life. Winterson wants us to keep our imaginations alive.          Beyond a rejection of our traditional values, Winterson seems to urge a general abandonment of the way we are inclined to view life. Her stories often discard the linearity of basic conventional laws of time and space, embracing instead works of extended reality, or as Michiko Kakutani called them, &quot; worlds in which the usual laws of plausibility are suspended.&quot; Winterson builds realities out of her metaphors, as opposed to using them as tools to describe the literal. Her stories become both allegorical and literal, and seem to uniquely bridge the territory which lies between the two. In &quot;Disappearance I&quot; and &quot;Disappearance II&quot; rooms literally disappear from houses. In &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; Winterson depicts a futuristic situation, similar to George Orwell's 1984 in its relation to present time. Sleep has been nearly outlawed, and the main character is obsessed with sleeping. Eventually, her bedroom, along with her lover, is stolen and destroyed. Thus Winterson builds a reality that is literally based on the perpetual hustle and bustle of our society, and her character's beautiful rejection of this reality reveals the horror inherent in certain aspects of our own. As in the case with Orwell's great novel 1984 , &quot;Disappearance I&quot; can actually be read as a distorted perception of today's world in which time, sleep, and dreams are taken for granted. The story functions on both literal and allegorical levels, and we are unsure at times which way to approach it. This ambiguity causes us to examine our present reality in a broader sense. In another story, &quot;The World and Other Places,&quot; the main character literally flies in an airplane onto her parents' lawn to visit them. The character is one who has abandoned her life on the earth's surface in order to &quot;do what [she] needs to do, which is to look for [her]self&quot;(98). Thus Winterson transforms the concept of philosophical inquiry into the literal lifestyle of a carefree pilot who travels the world at will, revealing the place in which the literal and the allegorical are one and the same. Both stories connect imaginary and real worlds and abandon conventional laws in order to reveal true meaning in ordinary life. &quot;Sleep now and hope to dream,&quot; Winterson's character from &quot;Disappearance I&quot; tells us (116). Winterson wants us to keep our dreams alive. She reminds us that we are in too much of a hurry to enjoy life or to think about it enough. She wants us to slow down and take care of ourselves. She wants us to fly the airplanes in our heads, and to love the importance of sleep and dreams, even if these things are in opposition to societal expectations.          Winterson not only writes between the lines of our lives, she writes between the lines of our foundational texts. She makes constant reference to the Bible, and to Greek mythology, reinventing and reinterpreting them to mean new things. The story of Orion and Artemis, or Diana, becomes a tale of rape and revenge, where in its conventional sense it could be regarded as an example of the misogynistic folklore which pervades our society's broad literary canon. In &quot;The Poetics of Sex,&quot; Winterson's character ironically calls her female lover &quot;my New Testament&quot; (42), and continually uses references from the New Testament to develop her ideas. This is ironic because most traditional interpretations of the New Testament have proclaimed it to be anti-homosexual. Winterson rejects this traditional interpretation and adopts her own, which is rich with unmined beauty and is non-discriminatory. Such a reinvention or reinterpretation of texts which are foundational to our society is an example of Winterson's encouraging us to read between the lines, and to notice beyond the obvious detail.          The character named Picasso appears frequently both in Winterson's stories and novels. The World and Other Places is littered with allusions to the painter. Picasso is the name of the narrator's lover in &quot;The Poetics of Sex,&quot; and of a protagonist in one of Winterson's novels Art and Lies . A reference to Picasso is, throughout Winterson's writing, applied to a character like Tom in &quot;Newton,&quot; who sees the world with a view different from those who surround him. The character Picasso in &quot;The Poetics of Sex&quot; tells us that most people &quot;don't know how to look at pictures&quot; (39); he embraces instead a view of the world unbounded by time and space. Winterson often associates such a perception with Picasso himself.          Ultimately, we are led not only to see Picasso in Winterson's characters, but also in herself as well. As the artist Picasso pioneered the cubist style of painting, in which an object is painted from various perspectives of time and space, Winterson seems to have in many ways, adopted this approach to writing. Her rejection of traditional values in her stories is paralleled by her rejection of the traditional narrative structure. Her stories often unfold without the conventional organization associated with plot and setting. She employs a variety of particularly unusual narrative structures to tell her stories, and she seems to be intentionally stylistically inconsistent in her choice of them. Winterson employs the style of the contemporary short story for some of her stories, like &quot;24-Hour Dog&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Crossing.&quot; Other stories, like &quot;The Three Friends&quot; or &quot;Orion&quot; seem to be either a modern version, or parody of mythic-type narratives. By juxtaposing such opposite styles, Winterson creates her own specific style. &quot;A Green Square&quot; is a perfectly realistic story, whereas &quot; O'Brien's First Christmas&quot; is clearly a fairy-tale both in its familiar plot structure, and in it's use of a fairy to enact magical events. Her structure seem to be toying with our fundamental perceptions of time and space. &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; &quot;Newton,&quot; and &quot;Turn of the World&quot; all depict alternate realities, sometimes displaced by time, and others outside the physical realm. Many stories, including &quot;The Poetics of Sex&quot; and &quot;The Lives of Saints&quot; reject linear plot, and lead us in full circle instead.          Despite their contrasting qualities, most of these widely varying structures used by Winterson seem to embody common, or closely similar thematic content. Like Picasso's cubist work, The World and Other Places seems to paint the same subject from various perspectives of time and space. In many of the stories in World, a character is left by a lover, close friend, or, as is the case in &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; even a room. This disappearance is often coupled with a sort of rejection of linear time, creating a sense of continuity for all things. In &quot;24-Hour Dog,&quot; the expression of this continuity is decisive: &quot;He found me out I knew he would. The strange thing is that although I have given him away, I can't lose him, and he can't die. There he is. Forever, part of the pattern, the dance, and running beside me, joyful&quot; (16). In other stories, such as &quot;The Poetics of Sex,&quot; a disappeared character is reintroduced into the narrative without explanation, as if he or she had never left. But most telling of all, and central to Written on the Body, The Passion, &quot;Lives of Saints, &quot; &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; and so many other pieces, are the situations in which a character seems to fall even more feverishly in love with someone or something that they have already physically lost. A character's love poems for the lost are often rich with catharsis. Winterson consoles the reader, who has undoubtedly left or been left before, as we all have, with this concept of continuity. In the opening line of Written on the Body , we are asked &quot;Why is the measure of love loss?&quot; And Winterson goes on to try and change how we measure love. She shows us the undeniable and ever-present beauty of being left and of leaving, provoking us to transcend the conventional perceptions of loss and its means of existence, time.          Not only does Jeanette Winterson reveal beauty through her thematic material, but she also invariably finds an incredible and delicate universe within mundane aspects of daily life to revel in and celebrate. The puppy is &quot;a universe of play,&quot; (5) the grass sings to us (166), and houses can fly (119). Reality is more than it seems to be. However, Winterson's extended reality is closely grounded in our own. She wants us to couple our own reality with the enchantment that is so pervasive and abundant in her stories. She offers us her gift of extra-sensory perception in a book with a beating heart.          But as revealed by her own statement that &quot;art releases what was lost,&quot; Winterson's repetitive thematic content and concern with the art of perception are both merely part of a much bigger scheme. As a writer, she is concerned with returning the lost meaning into our lives. Her ever-present yet disappearing characters could be regarded as personifications, or concrete realizations of this lost meaning. With this in mind, thematic material that at fist seems self concerned and petty takes on a world of implication. Winterson's lost lovers are there even though they seem to be gone. The beauty inherent in everyday life is there, wherever and whenever it seems to have been lost.          Jeanette Winterson is tricky with her sickness. She is sick of our houses with ceilings and no floors and wants us to build houses instead with floors and no ceilings, houses that deny limits and embrace sheltered truths that help us deny the limits. She sees the power and beauty in both imagination and reality, and she finds no need to distinguish between the two, as both exist co-dependently, like structural elements of a house with no ceiling. In short, Jeanette Winterson wants to release, through her own art, the love for life that has been lost. She writes for our very lives and hers.

The puppy is &quot;a universe of play,&quot; (5) the grass sings to us (166), and houses can fly (119). Reality is more than it seems to be. However, Winterson's extended reality is closely grounded in our own. She wants us to couple our own reality with the enchantment that is so pervasive and abundant in her stories. She offers us her gift of extra-sensory perception in a book with a beating heart.          But as revealed by her own statement that &quot;art releases what was lost,&quot; Winterson's repetitive thematic content and concern with the art of perception are both merely part of a much bigger scheme. As a writer, she is concerned with returning the lost meaning into our lives. Her ever-present yet disappearing characters could be regarded as personifications, or concrete realizations of this lost meaning. With this in mind, thematic material that at fist seems self concerned and petty takes on a world of implication. Winterson's lost lovers are there even though they seem to be gone. The beauty inherent in everyday life is there, wherever and whenever it seems to have been lost.          Jeanette Winterson is tricky with her sickness. She is sick of our houses with ceilings and no floors and wants us to build houses instead with floors and no ceilings, houses that deny limits and embrace sheltered truths that help us deny the limits. She sees the power and beauty in both imagination and reality, and she finds no need to distinguish between the two, as both exist co-dependently, like structural elements of a house with no ceiling. In short, Jeanette Winterson wants to release, through her own art, the love for life that has been lost. She writes for our very lives and hers.

Indeed, if it isn't distinctive, then it isn't a style. A creative person is someone who imagines what other people cannot. Their value to us lies in expanding our own possibilities. Walls fall. We break out. Art releases what was lost. Jeanette Winterson          Sometimes it seems that our lives have been watered down. That somehow we have been cheated of the true meaning of what is before us. Especially here in America, millions of people live comfortable lifestyles: they have money, they have place, they have success. But still many of us are bored and unhappy. We wake up every morning, go to work, go to school, and come home without feeling a thing. We are de facto disenchanted and nobody really knows why. Our imagination dies long before our bodies die.          Jeanette Winterson is a writer whose work seems to be aimed at changing this for herself and, if we will listen to her, perhaps for us as well. Winterson reveals both the beauty and the horror with which we are confronted on a daily basis. She shows us new universes within our own, and parallel universes outside our own. Her writing teaches us to read between the lines of our everyday lives. Even when this is not an obvious message delivered through the content of her stories, we find it within her language. Her words reveal and unfold layers of unrealized meaning on every page, until the reader is gently lowered back into his or her own world with a new fascination and awe for what already existed.          Winterson's writing rejects our conventional perception of life. She reveals the shallow fulfillment inherent in traditional values, expands our notion of time and reality, and gives us new insight on our existing realities. This is not only apparent through the content of Winterson's stories but also through her use of unusual and varied narrative structures. Winterson's work is deeply creative; she is constantly moving between territories which seem to be uncharted and new, and she never seems to write the same way twice. Thus her characters' refusal to accept the conventional means of living are paralleled by her own refusal to abide by the conventional means of storytelling. Winterson wants us to read and live beyond convention, as she writes and her characters live.          On a literal level, nearly all of Jeanette Winterson's writing contains some sort of rejection of traditional values or societal norms. The story &quot;Newton,&quot; from The World and Other Places portrays a distorted world in which traditional ideas and values are exaggerated to the point of domination. These ideas are rejected by Winterson through the character Tom, who is &quot;the stranger&quot; in his world (163). Much like Camus' character in L'Etranger, to whom Winterson alludes, Tom is an unconventional character who is not a typical member of his society. Tom escapes from his hometown, Newton, which represents an exaggerated societal ideal, and in the end he says that unlike the other inhabitants, his &quot;hills are ripe, and the water leaps at [his] throat . . .&quot; (175). With this one sentence , Winterson cleverly reveals the reward of enchantment found by Tom through his rejection of convention. This is mirrored in numerous other characters throughout The World And Other Places. In &quot;The Green Square,&quot; a character does not physically leave the society with which she grapples, but instead discovers that it is essential to her life that she &quot;find, everyday, a green square to walk in&quot;(203). The &quot;green square&quot; represent the character's realization of the beauty in the mundane aspects of her life. Although the stories present seemingly different realities, one might view them as a portrayal of the same character from two different perspectives. &quot;Newton&quot; possesses a fairy tale-like quality, beginning with the familiarly simple line &quot;This is the story of Tom,&quot; (163) while &quot;The Green Square&quot; is not far out of the conventional contemporary idiom, but both stories portray traditional values as boundaries standing between a character and his or her undiscovered love for everyday life. Another story, which possesses a mythic and allegorical quality, &quot;The Three Friends&quot; uses the metaphor of a floorless house to represent traditional values. The three characters who set out in search of &quot;that which cannot be found,&quot; first reach a &quot;house that celebrated ceilings and denied floors&quot; which offers them gold (49). The house represents the backwards and contradictory values of our society: value of material goods over more necessary things, and the placement of boundaries where no floor exists, so to speak. Throughout the story, the friends amass many material goods and conventional successes, but none of these end their search. The pursuit of material goods ultimately becomes the pursuit of &quot;that which cannot be found.&quot; Thus Winterson portrays the material values of society as unattainable goals without real fulfillment, whilst suggesting a &quot;green square to walk in&quot; as a true necessity-the foundation necessary for real life. Winterson wants us to keep our imaginations alive.          Beyond a rejection of our traditional values, Winterson seems to urge a general abandonment of the way we are inclined to view life. Her stories often discard the linearity of basic conventional laws of time and space, embracing instead works of extended reality, or as Michiko Kakutani called them, &quot; worlds in which the usual laws of plausibility are suspended.&quot; Winterson builds realities out of her metaphors, as opposed to using them as tools to describe the literal. Her stories become both allegorical and literal, and seem to uniquely bridge the territory which lies between the two. In &quot;Disappearance I&quot; and &quot;Disappearance II&quot; rooms literally disappear from houses. In &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; Winterson depicts a futuristic situation, similar to George Orwell's 1984 in its relation to present time. Sleep has been nearly outlawed, and the main character is obsessed with sleeping. Eventually, her bedroom, along with her lover, is stolen and destroyed. Thus Winterson builds a reality that is literally based on the perpetual hustle and bustle of our society, and her character's beautiful rejection of this reality reveals the horror inherent in certain aspects of our own. As in the case with Orwell's great novel 1984 , &quot;Disappearance I&quot; can actually be read as a distorted perception of today's world in which time, sleep, and dreams are taken for granted. The story functions on both literal and allegorical levels, and we are unsure at times which way to approach it. This ambiguity causes us to examine our present reality in a broader sense. In another story, &quot;The World and Other Places,&quot; the main character literally flies in an airplane onto her parents' lawn to visit them. The character is one who has abandoned her life on the earth's surface in order to &quot;do what [she] needs to do, which is to look for [her]self&quot;(98). Thus Winterson transforms the concept of philosophical inquiry into the literal lifestyle of a carefree pilot who travels the world at will, revealing the place in which the literal and the allegorical are one and the same. Both stories connect imaginary and real worlds and abandon conventional laws in order to reveal true meaning in ordinary life. &quot;Sleep now and hope to dream,&quot; Winterson's character from &quot;Disappearance I&quot; tells us (116). Winterson wants us to keep our dreams alive. She reminds us that we are in too much of a hurry to enjoy life or to think about it enough. She wants us to slow down and take care of ourselves. She wants us to fly the airplanes in our heads, and to love the importance of sleep and dreams, even if these things are in opposition to societal expectations.          Winterson not only writes between the lines of our lives, she writes between the lines of our foundational texts. She makes constant reference to the Bible, and to Greek mythology, reinventing and reinterpreting them to mean new things. The story of Orion and Artemis, or Diana, becomes a tale of rape and revenge, where in its conventional sense it could be regarded as an example of the misogynistic folklore which pervades our society's broad literary canon. In &quot;The Poetics of Sex,&quot; Winterson's character ironically calls her female lover &quot;my New Testament&quot; (42), and continually uses references from the New Testament to develop her ideas. This is ironic because most traditional interpretations of the New Testament have proclaimed it to be anti-homosexual. Winterson rejects this traditional interpretation and adopts her own, which is rich with unmined beauty and is non-discriminatory. Such a reinvention or reinterpretation of texts which are foundational to our society is an example of Winterson's encouraging us to read between the lines, and to notice beyond the obvious detail.          The character named Picasso appears frequently both in Winterson's stories and novels. The World and Other Places is littered with allusions to the painter. Picasso is the name of the narrator's lover in &quot;The Poetics of Sex,&quot; and of a protagonist in one of Winterson's novels Art and Lies . A reference to Picasso is, throughout Winterson's writing, applied to a character like Tom in &quot;Newton,&quot; who sees the world with a view different from those who surround him. The character Picasso in &quot;The Poetics of Sex&quot; tells us that most people &quot;don't know how to look at pictures&quot; (39); he embraces instead a view of the world unbounded by time and space. Winterson often associates such a perception with Picasso himself.          Ultimately, we are led not only to see Picasso in Winterson's characters, but also in herself as well. As the artist Picasso pioneered the cubist style of painting, in which an object is painted from various perspectives of time and space, Winterson seems to have in many ways, adopted this approach to writing. Her rejection of traditional values in her stories is paralleled by her rejection of the traditional narrative structure. Her stories often unfold without the conventional organization associated with plot and setting. She employs a variety of particularly unusual narrative structures to tell her stories, and she seems to be intentionally stylistically inconsistent in her choice of them. Winterson employs the style of the contemporary short story for some of her stories, like &quot;24-Hour Dog&quot; and &quot;Atlantic Crossing.&quot; Other stories, like &quot;The Three Friends&quot; or &quot;Orion&quot; seem to be either a modern version, or parody of mythic-type narratives. By juxtaposing such opposite styles, Winterson creates her own specific style. &quot;A Green Square&quot; is a perfectly realistic story, whereas &quot; O'Brien's First Christmas&quot; is clearly a fairy-tale both in its familiar plot structure, and in it's use of a fairy to enact magical events. Her structure seem to be toying with our fundamental perceptions of time and space. &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; &quot;Newton,&quot; and &quot;Turn of the World&quot; all depict alternate realities, sometimes displaced by time, and others outside the physical realm. Many stories, including &quot;The Poetics of Sex&quot; and &quot;The Lives of Saints&quot; reject linear plot, and lead us in full circle instead.          Despite their contrasting qualities, most of these widely varying structures used by Winterson seem to embody common, or closely similar thematic content. Like Picasso's cubist work, The World and Other Places seems to paint the same subject from various perspectives of time and space. In many of the stories in World, a character is left by a lover, close friend, or, as is the case in &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; even a room. This disappearance is often coupled with a sort of rejection of linear time, creating a sense of continuity for all things. In &quot;24-Hour Dog,&quot; the expression of this continuity is decisive: &quot;He found me out I knew he would. The strange thing is that although I have given him away, I can't lose him, and he can't die. There he is. Forever, part of the pattern, the dance, and running beside me, joyful&quot; (16). In other stories, such as &quot;The Poetics of Sex,&quot; a disappeared character is reintroduced into the narrative without explanation, as if he or she had never left. But most telling of all, and central to Written on the Body, The Passion, &quot;Lives of Saints, &quot; &quot;Disappearance I,&quot; and so many other pieces, are the situations in which a character seems to fall even more feverishly in love with someone or something that they have already physically lost. A character's love poems for the lost are often rich with catharsis. Winterson consoles the reader, who has undoubtedly left or been left before, as we all have, with this concept of continuity. In the opening line of Written on the Body , we are asked &quot;Why is the measure of love loss?&quot; And Winterson goes on to try and change how we measure love. She shows us the undeniable and ever-present beauty of being left and of leaving, provoking us to transcend the conventional perceptions of loss and its means of existence, time.          Not only does Jeanette Winterson reveal beauty through her thematic material, but she also invariably finds an incredible and delicate universe within mundane aspects of daily life to revel in and celebrate. The puppy is &quot;a universe of play,&quot; (5) the grass sings to us (166), and houses can fly (119). Reality is more than it seems to be. However, Winterson's extended reality is closely grounded in our own. She wants us to couple our own reality with the enchantment that is so pervasive and abundant in her stories. She offers us her gift of extra-sensory perception in a book with a beating heart.          But as revealed by her own statement that &quot;art releases what was lost,&quot; Winterson's repetitive thematic content and concern with the art of perception are both merely part of a much bigger scheme. As a writer, she is concerned with returning the lost meaning into our lives. Her ever-present yet disappearing characters could be regarded as personifications, or concrete realizations of this lost meaning. With this in mind, thematic material that at fist seems self concerned and petty takes on a world of implication. Winterson's lost lovers are there even though they seem to be gone. The beauty inherent in everyday life is there, wherever and whenever it seems to have been lost.          Jeanette Winterson is tricky with her sickness. She is sick of our houses with ceilings and no floors and wants us to build houses instead with floors and no ceilings, houses that deny limits and embrace sheltered truths that help us deny the limits. She sees the power and beauty in both imagination and reality, and she finds no need to distinguish between the two, as both exist co-dependently, like structural elements of a house with no ceiling. In short, Jeanette Winterson wants to release, through her own art, the love for life that has been lost. She writes for our very lives and hers.

Asia's  Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam, 1885\u20131962    EAST-UA  538 Identical  to HIST-UA 538. Roberts and Young. 4 points.    Develops  a comparative understanding of national independence movements, as well as the  context within which they unfolded. Introduces students to some of the figures  in modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of India and  Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent nationhood and of China from  its semi-colonial status to liberation. Principal figures include Mohandas  Gandhi, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. Pays due attention to other relevant  figures, such as Gokhale, Tilak, Jinnah, and Nehru in the case of India; Li  Hongzhang, Sun Yatsen, Chen Duxiu, La Dazhao, and Chiang Kai-shek in the case  of China; and Phan Boi Chau in the case of Vietnam.          Seminar:  Cold War in Asia    EAST-UA  552 Offered  every year. 4 points.    Focuses  on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and  concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) are  the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We examine the following  topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the  U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the  isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's  global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan;  Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian  issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush  and Asia's place in \"a New World Order\"; and finally, the Clinton and George W.  Bush years. We examine key declassified National Security documents,  interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the  arguments used to justify American policy.          History  of Modern Korea    EAST-UA  609 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Starting  in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345),  national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a  \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized  around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues  that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on  modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a  broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent  texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were  reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.          Korean  Modernism    EAST-UA  610 4  points.    Considers  the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other  cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter  modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among  imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular. Through intensive reading  of works from 1920s and 1930s Korea, students obtain an idea of the parameters  of modern Korean literature and of the main issues involved in the discussion  of modernity in Korea.          20th-Century  Korean Literature in Translation    EAST-UA  611 4  points.    Provides  an overview of 20th-century Korean literature, tracing its development under  the competing influences of tradition, history, and the West. Readings include  drama, poetry, and fiction from modern and contemporary periods. Includes  occasional lectures on classical forms of Korean literature and drama.          Japanese  Cinema    EAST-UA  613 Offered  every year. 4 points.    Examines  key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such  as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect  of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and  specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.          Aesthetics  and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan    EAST-UA  615 Looser.  4 points.    Offers  a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the  mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of  seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these  visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental  transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a  range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts,  architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary  perspectives.          Approaches  to Chinese Cinema    EAST-UA  618 4 points.    The  development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the  emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film  became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course  emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as  formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are  explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and  sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.          Mass  Culture: Japan    EAST-UA  707 Looser.  4 points.    Looks  at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan,  largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes  considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday  life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples  from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the  fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the  rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.          Japanese  Animation and New Media    EAST-UA  708 Looser.  4 points.    Looks  at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not  exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression.  Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of  expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in  animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre;  and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception.  Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also  considered. Epic Romances of Asia: China, Japan, and Vietnam EAST-UA 718 Roberts. 4 points. Covers comparatively three romantic classics of Asian literature, one Vietnamese ( Tale of Kieu ), one Japanese ( Tale of Genji ), and one Chinese ( Dream of the Red Chamber ), plus brief supplementary Buddhist texts. All literary texts are read in their entirety, except for limited optional exclusions from Dream of the Red Chamber , due to its great length (over 2000 pages). Major topics are the character of the heroines, whose role is central in each work, the relationship of romance and marriage to political power and social customs, the authority of parents and elders. Confucian secular concepts of authority co-exist and contend with concepts of Buddhist reinterpretation of the secular world and the escapes from its suffering that Buddhism offers both institutionally and ideologically. While focusing on analysis of the readings, students are urged to explore secondary scholarly studies. Topics  in Japanese Literature    EAST-UA  719 4  points.    Topics  vary semester by semester.          Readings  in Chinese Philosophy and Culture    EAST-UA  722 Formerly  Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.    Covers  Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the  era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206  B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states.  During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were  established. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of  Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of  his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and  followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the  legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of  Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the  transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. We  end with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the  novel The  Three Kingdoms .  The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin  and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four  centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280  C.E.          Historical  Epics of China and Japan    EAST-UA  726 Roberts.  4 points.    We  compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the  Heike ;  and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red  Mansions .  These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written  by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military  epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the  qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to  the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and  military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the  royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female  characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with  two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on  Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged).  Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex  narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these  three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and  the larger design of the authors.

Traditional  Drama of China &amp; Japan    EAST-UA  729 Roberts.  4 points.    Compares  a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also  as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident,  character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention  is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions  and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also  considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened  for the class or assigned for viewing.          20th-Century  Chinese Literature in Translation    EAST-UA  731   Offered every year. 4 points.    Explores  the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and  historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on  the culture and self-understanding of modern China.          Japan  Through Its Literature    EAST-UA  734 No  knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.    Introduces  undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works,  starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji , which became a  national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness , texts of Noh  plays, the Chushingura , and plays of  Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels  starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first  modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment , Sound of the  Mountain ,  and The  Waiting Years .  Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a  longer paper.          Vietnam:  Its History    EAST-UA  737 Identical  to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.    Focuses  on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it  was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military  strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are  regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an  oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.  Begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of  French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the  war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS  links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's  deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower  administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the  decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy  administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war  under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and  interpretations of them.          Introduction  to Buddhism    EAST-UA  832 Identical  to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.
