What are the Urban Design and Architecture Studies Courses?    1.  How Do You Declare a Major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies?   To declare a major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies, students must meet with either the Director or Assistant Director of the program, and complete departmental forms. We do not receive your information if you declare your major through CAS advisement or the LSP office: You will not be registered as an Urban Design and Architecture Studies major unless you meet with the Urban Design and Architecture Studies faculty. Failing to declare your major through the department may limit your eligibility to register for popular Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses. The department reserves seats in these classes for majors, but the computer system will not record your major if you do not register properly. back to top  2.    What are the Goals of the Major?   Urban Design and Architecture Studies is a specialty major within the Art History Department. The primary goal of this program is to encourage a critical and practical understanding of cities and architecture. Two pre-requisite courses introduce students to key issues in the history of the built environment, preparing them to study the dynamics of urban development. Professionals working in urban design and architecture teach many of our advanced courses; the major can help students prepare for professional careers in city planning, architecture and design, public administration, real estate, law, journalism, and allied fields. back to top  3.    What are the Requirements of the Major?   The prerequisite courses for an Urban Design and Architecture Studies major are \u201cHistory of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present\u201d and \u201cShaping the Urban Environment.\u201d Majors are also required to take at least six (6) advanced courses and one (1) upper-level seminar, for a total of nine (9) courses in the major. The university offers Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses in New York and at NYU Abroad campuses in London, Paris, and Florence. Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses offered in the department are listed below. Students may also enroll in cross-referenced courses for Urban Design and Architecture Studies credit. Cross-referenced courses in Anthropology, Economics, Metropolitan Studies, and Sociology are listed on the Urban Design and Architecture Studies registration form. Please note that Urban Design and Architecture Studies students are exempt from the MAP-Expressive Cultures requirement, but may take the MAP course \u201cExpressive Cultures: Images, New York Field Study\u201d for Urban Design and Architecture Studies credit. Note that the total of nine (9) courses represents the minimum number necessary to complete the major. The department encourages students to take more courses if possible. Students should also consider courses in related fields. back to top  4.    What are Upper-level Seminars?   The Urban Design and Architecture Studies program and the Art History Department encourage discussion in classes, so that students and faculty may share ideas in a collegial environment. Because small seminars promote discussion, all Urban Design and Architecture Studies majors are required to take at least one upper-level seminar, in which enrollment is limited to 12 students. Any of the seminars listed below may be taken for seminar credit, except \u201cDecision Making and Urban Design.\u201d back to top  5.    What is a Senior Honors Thesis?    Honors students \u2014that is, students with a GPA of 3.65 or higher, both in their overall course work and within the major\u2014 are eligible to write a senior honors thesis. This is a long (approx. 40 page) research paper on an advanced topic, written in close consultation with a faculty advisor. The thesis will give the student a taste of graduate-level work in art history. However, it should not be viewed simply as a step on the way to graduate school in art history. Writing a senior thesis provides valuable training in research, organization, and self-expression, skills that will be equally useful to students planning careers in journalism, law, business, medicine, or education.  Honors students interested in writing a senior thesis should find a faculty advisor at the beginning of spring semester of junior year. (As noted above, they may also wish to take their advanced seminar in spring semester of junior year, so that the research and writing required for seminar reports do not conflict with the research and writing for the thesis.) In consultation with the advisor, they should refine a specific topic, which they may wish to begin researching over the summer between junior and senior years.  In the fall semester of their senior year, students writing theses work together in a special honors seminar on research methods and organization, while continuing to meet regularly with their faculty advisors. In the spring semester, thesis students register for a four credit Independent Study and meet weekly with their individual advisers, writing and revising the text over a period of months.  Please note that the fall honors seminar is not the same as\u2014and does not replace\u2014the advanced seminar required of all art history majors. (As mentioned above, honors students who plan to write a senior thesis may take the advanced seminar in their junior year.) Students doing a double major in art history and in another department should note that the honors seminar for the senior thesis counts as an elective, filling the electives requirement. It is thus possible to write a senior thesis while taking no more than the basic nine courses required to complete the major.  The senior thesis should be completed three weeks before the end of the spring semester. At that point, two more faculty members will be recruited to serve as readers, along with the student\u2019s faculty advisor. The student will then meet with the three readers for a Thesis Defense, at the end of which the readers will meet separately to assign a grade of no honors, honors, high honors, or highest honors. back to top  6.    What do Course Numbers Mean?    All Art History and Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses have the heading ARTH-UA, taking the form ARTH-UA XXXX. Most Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses take the form ARTH-UA 6XX, although some will conform to the chronological sequence followed by the Art History Department. Study abroad courses are listed as ARTH-UA 9XXX.  Each semester the department prepares a summary of courses that will be offered in the following semester, explaining which courses will satisfy Urban Design and Architecture Studies requirements. This summary is distributed to all majors through the department listserv. It is also available in printed form in the department office, Silver 303. back to top  7.    How Do Internships and Independent Studies Work?   The Urban Design and Architecture Studies program encourages students to undertake internships at New York area design firms, government and non-profit agencies, and museums. To receive course credit for internships, students must register for a two-point independent study with a professor who agrees to supervise the project. Students must meet regularly with this adviser and complete a research paper, 15-20 pages in length, on a topic related to their experiences and duties. Students should work with the adviser to create a reading list related to the project, and this material should be incorporated into the research paper. Students must also provide their adviser with a letter from their work supervisor, confirming their participation and performance. back to top  8.    What Courses are Offered Abroad?   NYU encourages all students to study abroad for at least one semester. For Urban Design and Architecture Studies students this offers a unique opportunity to experience and study the urbanism and architecture of other cultures. The NYU Abroad programs in Florence, Paris, and London usually offer courses in Urban Design and Architecture Studies each semester. Course offerings in other cities are more limited; note that NYU programs in Accra, Madrid, Prague, and Shanghai offer few or no courses that count toward the Urban Design and Architecture Studies major. Courses given abroad with the same titles and course numbers as those given in New York generally count for Urban Design and Architecture Studies credit, but be sure to check with your adviser before registering for these courses. Some courses offered abroad have no equivalent in New York, but can be counted toward the Urban Design and Architecture Studies major. Students majoring in Urban Design can earn credit toward   the major for 2 courses taken abroad or if a third course is taken (in a  different location) then the student can earn major credit for 3   courses. Students minoring in Urban Design can earn   credit toward the minor for a maximum of 2 courses taken abroad. All students must meet with a faculty adviser to discuss their Urban Design and Architecture Studies progress before leaving for a semester abroad. back to top  9.    What is Advisement?   Students are required to meet with the Director or Assistant Director of the Urban Design and Architecture Studies program once a semester, usually during the two weeks before registration. At this meeting the student and adviser will discuss the student\u2019s plan of study and assess progress toward the major. back to top  10.    Can I Minor in Studio Art?    Urban Design and Architecture Studies majors are eligible to take studio art as a minor. The minor consists of studio courses totaling sixteen (16) points, taken in the Steinhardt School of Education. Students must take at least one course in each of three areas: Drawing/Painting/Printmaking; Sculpture; and Media, plus additional electives sufficient to make up the total of sixteen (16) points. The Studio Art minor may require four or five courses, depending on the student\u2019s choice of classes. Students wishing to take this minor should contact Ann Chwatsky, Student Advisement Coordinator in Steinhardt, as AC31@nyu.edu. The main phone number for appointments is 212-998-5700. See also the detailed list of requirements and courses, provided below.  back to top  11.    Can I Take Urban Design and Architecture Studies as a Double Major or as a Minor?     Students often take Urban Design and Architecture Studies as a double major, along with Social Sciences, Journalism, History, or other subjects. The relatively few courses for the major (9) allow most students to complete a double major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies within the normal eight semesters of college. This does require careful planning, however, so double majors should consult with their advisers in both departments. In some cases an Urban Design and Architecture Studies course may be \u201cdouble counted\u201d for credit in both majors, but CAS generally permits only one course to be credited in this way. Urban Design and Architecture Studies can be taken as a minor in conjunction with another major. The minor consists of four courses taken in the department. In this case the seminar requirement is waived; coursework consists of the two pre-requisite courses (\"History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present\" and \"Shaping the Urban Environment\") plus two other courses in the program. back to top  12.    How can Transfer Students Receive Credit for Previous Coursework?    Students coming into Urban Design and Architecture Studies from other college programs should meet with the Director or Assistant Director of the program to determine if courses previously taken can be counted toward the major. Please bring copies of course syllabi, reading lists, and descriptions to this meeting. Please note that Urban Design and Architecture Studies advisers will determine what previous courses count toward the major, but not how many points the will count toward graduation. Decisions about credit points are made exclusively by the Registrar\u2019s office.  Students entering Urban Design and Architecture Studies from the Liberal Studies Program (LSP) should try to complete the pre-requisites while still enrolled in LSP. The Department will offer a section of Shaping the Environment in the spring term to allow LSP students to begin the major in their Sophomore year. back to top  13.

What are the Urban Design and Architecture Studies Courses?    1.  How Do You Declare a Major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies?   To declare a major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies, students must meet with either the Director or Assistant Director of the program, and complete departmental forms. We do not receive your information if you declare your major through CAS advisement or the LSP office: You will not be registered as an Urban Design and Architecture Studies major unless you meet with the Urban Design and Architecture Studies faculty. Failing to declare your major through the department may limit your eligibility to register for popular Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses. The department reserves seats in these classes for majors, but the computer system will not record your major if you do not register properly. back to top  2.    What are the Goals of the Major?   Urban Design and Architecture Studies is a specialty major within the Art History Department. The primary goal of this program is to encourage a critical and practical understanding of cities and architecture. Two pre-requisite courses introduce students to key issues in the history of the built environment, preparing them to study the dynamics of urban development. Professionals working in urban design and architecture teach many of our advanced courses; the major can help students prepare for professional careers in city planning, architecture and design, public administration, real estate, law, journalism, and allied fields. back to top  3.    What are the Requirements of the Major?   The prerequisite courses for an Urban Design and Architecture Studies major are \u201cHistory of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present\u201d and \u201cShaping the Urban Environment.\u201d Majors are also required to take at least six (6) advanced courses and one (1) upper-level seminar, for a total of nine (9) courses in the major. The university offers Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses in New York and at NYU Abroad campuses in London, Paris, and Florence. Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses offered in the department are listed below. Students may also enroll in cross-referenced courses for Urban Design and Architecture Studies credit. Cross-referenced courses in Anthropology, Economics, Metropolitan Studies, and Sociology are listed on the Urban Design and Architecture Studies registration form. Please note that Urban Design and Architecture Studies students are exempt from the MAP-Expressive Cultures requirement, but may take the MAP course \u201cExpressive Cultures: Images, New York Field Study\u201d for Urban Design and Architecture Studies credit. Note that the total of nine (9) courses represents the minimum number necessary to complete the major. The department encourages students to take more courses if possible. Students should also consider courses in related fields. back to top  4.    What are Upper-level Seminars?   The Urban Design and Architecture Studies program and the Art History Department encourage discussion in classes, so that students and faculty may share ideas in a collegial environment. Because small seminars promote discussion, all Urban Design and Architecture Studies majors are required to take at least one upper-level seminar, in which enrollment is limited to 12 students. Any of the seminars listed below may be taken for seminar credit, except \u201cDecision Making and Urban Design.\u201d back to top  5.    What is a Senior Honors Thesis?    Honors students \u2014that is, students with a GPA of 3.65 or higher, both in their overall course work and within the major\u2014 are eligible to write a senior honors thesis. This is a long (approx. 40 page) research paper on an advanced topic, written in close consultation with a faculty advisor. The thesis will give the student a taste of graduate-level work in art history. However, it should not be viewed simply as a step on the way to graduate school in art history. Writing a senior thesis provides valuable training in research, organization, and self-expression, skills that will be equally useful to students planning careers in journalism, law, business, medicine, or education.  Honors students interested in writing a senior thesis should find a faculty advisor at the beginning of spring semester of junior year. (As noted above, they may also wish to take their advanced seminar in spring semester of junior year, so that the research and writing required for seminar reports do not conflict with the research and writing for the thesis.) In consultation with the advisor, they should refine a specific topic, which they may wish to begin researching over the summer between junior and senior years.  In the fall semester of their senior year, students writing theses work together in a special honors seminar on research methods and organization, while continuing to meet regularly with their faculty advisors. In the spring semester, thesis students register for a four credit Independent Study and meet weekly with their individual advisers, writing and revising the text over a period of months.  Please note that the fall honors seminar is not the same as\u2014and does not replace\u2014the advanced seminar required of all art history majors. (As mentioned above, honors students who plan to write a senior thesis may take the advanced seminar in their junior year.) Students doing a double major in art history and in another department should note that the honors seminar for the senior thesis counts as an elective, filling the electives requirement. It is thus possible to write a senior thesis while taking no more than the basic nine courses required to complete the major.  The senior thesis should be completed three weeks before the end of the spring semester. At that point, two more faculty members will be recruited to serve as readers, along with the student\u2019s faculty advisor. The student will then meet with the three readers for a Thesis Defense, at the end of which the readers will meet separately to assign a grade of no honors, honors, high honors, or highest honors. back to top  6.    What do Course Numbers Mean?    All Art History and Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses have the heading ARTH-UA, taking the form ARTH-UA XXXX. Most Urban Design and Architecture Studies courses take the form ARTH-UA 6XX, although some will conform to the chronological sequence followed by the Art History Department. Study abroad courses are listed as ARTH-UA 9XXX.  Each semester the department prepares a summary of courses that will be offered in the following semester, explaining which courses will satisfy Urban Design and Architecture Studies requirements. This summary is distributed to all majors through the department listserv. It is also available in printed form in the department office, Silver 303. back to top  7.    How Do Internships and Independent Studies Work?   The Urban Design and Architecture Studies program encourages students to undertake internships at New York area design firms, government and non-profit agencies, and museums. To receive course credit for internships, students must register for a two-point independent study with a professor who agrees to supervise the project. Students must meet regularly with this adviser and complete a research paper, 15-20 pages in length, on a topic related to their experiences and duties. Students should work with the adviser to create a reading list related to the project, and this material should be incorporated into the research paper. Students must also provide their adviser with a letter from their work supervisor, confirming their participation and performance. back to top  8.    What Courses are Offered Abroad?   NYU encourages all students to study abroad for at least one semester. For Urban Design and Architecture Studies students this offers a unique opportunity to experience and study the urbanism and architecture of other cultures. The NYU Abroad programs in Florence, Paris, and London usually offer courses in Urban Design and Architecture Studies each semester. Course offerings in other cities are more limited; note that NYU programs in Accra, Madrid, Prague, and Shanghai offer few or no courses that count toward the Urban Design and Architecture Studies major. Courses given abroad with the same titles and course numbers as those given in New York generally count for Urban Design and Architecture Studies credit, but be sure to check with your adviser before registering for these courses. Some courses offered abroad have no equivalent in New York, but can be counted toward the Urban Design and Architecture Studies major. Students majoring in Urban Design can earn credit toward   the major for 2 courses taken abroad or if a third course is taken (in a  different location) then the student can earn major credit for 3   courses. Students minoring in Urban Design can earn   credit toward the minor for a maximum of 2 courses taken abroad. All students must meet with a faculty adviser to discuss their Urban Design and Architecture Studies progress before leaving for a semester abroad. back to top  9.    What is Advisement?   Students are required to meet with the Director or Assistant Director of the Urban Design and Architecture Studies program once a semester, usually during the two weeks before registration. At this meeting the student and adviser will discuss the student\u2019s plan of study and assess progress toward the major. back to top  10.    Can I Minor in Studio Art?    Urban Design and Architecture Studies majors are eligible to take studio art as a minor. The minor consists of studio courses totaling sixteen (16) points, taken in the Steinhardt School of Education. Students must take at least one course in each of three areas: Drawing/Painting/Printmaking; Sculpture; and Media, plus additional electives sufficient to make up the total of sixteen (16) points. The Studio Art minor may require four or five courses, depending on the student\u2019s choice of classes. Students wishing to take this minor should contact Ann Chwatsky, Student Advisement Coordinator in Steinhardt, as AC31@nyu.edu. The main phone number for appointments is 212-998-5700. See also the detailed list of requirements and courses, provided below.  back to top  11.    Can I Take Urban Design and Architecture Studies as a Double Major or as a Minor?     Students often take Urban Design and Architecture Studies as a double major, along with Social Sciences, Journalism, History, or other subjects. The relatively few courses for the major (9) allow most students to complete a double major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies within the normal eight semesters of college. This does require careful planning, however, so double majors should consult with their advisers in both departments. In some cases an Urban Design and Architecture Studies course may be \u201cdouble counted\u201d for credit in both majors, but CAS generally permits only one course to be credited in this way. Urban Design and Architecture Studies can be taken as a minor in conjunction with another major. The minor consists of four courses taken in the department. In this case the seminar requirement is waived; coursework consists of the two pre-requisite courses (\"History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present\" and \"Shaping the Urban Environment\") plus two other courses in the program. back to top  12.    How can Transfer Students Receive Credit for Previous Coursework?    Students coming into Urban Design and Architecture Studies from other college programs should meet with the Director or Assistant Director of the program to determine if courses previously taken can be counted toward the major. Please bring copies of course syllabi, reading lists, and descriptions to this meeting. Please note that Urban Design and Architecture Studies advisers will determine what previous courses count toward the major, but not how many points the will count toward graduation. Decisions about credit points are made exclusively by the Registrar\u2019s office.  Students entering Urban Design and Architecture Studies from the Liberal Studies Program (LSP) should try to complete the pre-requisites while still enrolled in LSP. The Department will offer a section of Shaping the Environment in the spring term to allow LSP students to begin the major in their Sophomore year. back to top  13.

Lectures on still life painting and polychrome wood sculpture are also included. The 18th century (the Tiepolo family, Mel\u00e9ndez) is then discussed. The focus then shifts to the art of Francisco de Goya and the projection of Spanish art into the modern era. This course also seeks to define Spain in the 16th and 17th century as a global power and thus emphasis is also placed on art in such New World centers as Mexico City and Lima in the colonial era.

Major emphasis is given to colonial painting, sculpture, and architecture in Mexico and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Andes. Painting and sculpture of the 19th century and the secularization of Latin American art is then examined before a discussion of the establishment of modernism that comes about with the formation of academies and the travels of many artists from all parts of Latin America and the Caribbean to Europe and the U.S. from 1900 onward. Important modern artists such as the Mexican muralists, Frida Kahlo, Joaqu\u00edn Torres-Garc\u00eda, Tarsila do Amaral, Wifredo Lam, and the surrealists will bring the course up to approximately 1950.

Focusing on the creation of modern building types such as the bank, state capitol, museum, railroad station, and skyscraper, the course begins in the later 18th century with the idealistic designs of Ledoux and Boull\u00e9e. After considering the forms and meanings associated with neoclassicism, the course examines the Gothic revival and subsequent 19th-century movements (e.g., high Victorian Gothic, Second Empire, beaux-arts classicism) as efforts to find appropriate expressions for diverse building forms. Students consider changes resulting from the Industrial Revolution, including developments in technology, and the reforms of art nouveau and secession architecture. Works of Adam, Soane, Jefferson, Schinkel, Pugin, Richardson, and Sullivan; McKim, Mead, and White; Mackintosh, early Frank Lloyd Wright, and others.    Modern Architecture: 1914 to the Present    ARTH-UA 409 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or Early Modern Architecture: 1776-1914 (ARTH-UA 408), or History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), or Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study (MAP-UA 722), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

Neoclassicism to Realism    ARTH-UA 411 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   The Enlightenment shaped the visual arts in two seemingly antithetical ways. On the one hand, the period's valorization of cool rationalism contributed to the rise of neoclassicism as a dominant style during the 18th century. The other course of Enlightenment thinking, exemplified by the writings of J. J. Rousseau, celebrated emotion as the purest form of intellectual as well as spiritual expression. Romanticism, with its emphasis on subjectivity and intense emotionalism, is as much a product of the Enlightenment as neoclassicism. Following on the heels of romanticism, realism has been alternately described as a rejection of romanticism and as an extension of it. Focusing on these three stylistic movements, this course examines how late 18th- and early 19th-century artists negotiated not just the aesthetic ideas of the Enlightenment but its political consequences as well.    Impressionism to Expressionism    ARTH-UA 412 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Beginning by considering how impressionism refined and redirected the artistic aims of 19th-century realism, this course follows the development of progressive art to the brink of cubism and pure abstraction in the first years of the 20th century. Following impressionism and post-impressionism, close attention is paid to symbolism, aestheticism, art nouveau, the Arts and Crafts movement, fauvism, and expressionism. The aesthetic aims of these movements are analyzed in tandem with the social and cultural conditions that generated them.    Cubism to Abstract Expressionism    ARTH-UA 413 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   After analyzing the invention of cubism by Picasso and Braque, this course examines its international reverberations, including Italian futurism, the later phases of German expressionism, the de Stijl movement in the Netherlands, and suprematism and constructivism in revolutionary Russia. The dada movement in the period during and after World War I is examined as a reaction to the apparent bankruptcy, cultural and artistic, of Western civilization. However, this nihilistic impulse is followed by a \"return to order\" in the 1920s. The course then examines the tensions in the multiple currents of surrealism: metamorphic, academic, and abject. Painting after World War II, from Pollock to Dubuffet, is analyzed as an extension and transformation of prewar trends.    Postmodern Art and Contemporary Art    ARTH-UA 414 Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam. Offered every year. 4 points.   Surveys art in the postmodern era, ca. 1955 to the present. After examining the innovations of the neo-avant-garde generation (1955\u201375), our focus shifts from the radical innovations in mediums, materials, and techniques to the expanded field of critical engagement that contemporary art encompasses. Discrete \"early\" developments sometimes dubbed neo-dada, such as op, pop, and fluxus, but also minimalism, conceptual art, and arte povera, radically diversified the look of art and forced the dissolution of stylistic and formal categorization in favor of a classification based on a particular question, mediatic intervention, or mode of critique. If the late 20th century brought a new emphasis on gender, race, and a number of newly pressing political forces and motivations, as we enter the 21st century, post-studio (and perhaps also \"post-critical\") artistic practices increasingly tend to be reoriented toward technology and globalism, further complicating our idea of art's relationship with its own present.    Aesthetic History of Photography    ARTH-UA 431 Identical to PHTI-UT 1102. Prerequisite: History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2), or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), or a score of 5 on the AP Art History exam.

An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. The course emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.    South Asian Art I: Indus Valley to 1200    ARTH-UA 530 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introductory survey of the history of South Asia from 2000 B.C.E. to 1200 C.E., with an emphasis on the Indian subcontinent. From the Indus Valley culture to the present day, artistic production has played a critical role in the transmission of religious beliefs and the development of cultural systems in and around South Asia. Diverse regions were linked by trade, politics, and cultural relationships, and interaction can be charted through the changing forms and functions of art. We consider the historical circumstances surrounding the production of South and Southeast Asian art, as well as the problems that art historians face when trying to interpret the surviving evidence. We look at art in a variety of media, including, but not limited to, architecture, urban form, sculpture, painting, and performance.

It follows the cultivation of new tastes in the Mughal and Rajput courts through the vigorous interaction among Persian, Indic, and European artists and elites. Finally, it turns to the colonial and postcolonial artistic responses to South Asia's complex past(s). By looking at art in a range of media\u2014including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography\u2014this course considers the ways in which art actively served as expressions of political authority and cultural identity.

The period saw the initial formation of an Arab empire stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean, a decline in centralized authority, and the rise to political prominence of various North African, Iranian, and Central Asian dynasties from the 10th century onward. These political developments are reflected in the increasingly heterogeneous nature of Islamic material culture over this time span.    Art in the Islamic World II: From the Mongols to Modernism    ARTH-UA 541 Offered periodically. 4 points.   An introduction to the arts of Islam during a period of dynamic cultural and political change in the Islamic world.

Offered every year. 4 points.   Serves as a laboratory for the investigation of New York City's infrastructure, using the definition of the word as a point of departure. In what ways can the city be perceived as a collective undertaking, with intricate components interwoven in continuous strands? What systems and forces give the city and its neighborhoods their current form, and what influences their future shape? Can these systems be dissected? What do these analyses tell us about the relationship of the city to its inhabitants and to the wider environment? Through lectures, reading assignments, discussions, and field trips, we investigate some of the major components of the city's infrastructure, such as the street grid, water supply, waste disposal, and subway system.    Urban Design and the Law    ARTH-UA 674 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director.

Topics include redesign of the business district; recovery of city resources; and social, political, and economic implications of new city forms considered in projections for a new urban face.    Drawing for Architects and Others    ARTH-UA 676 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 2 points.   A basic drawing course intended to teach students to perceive\u2014to record phenomena manually without relying on formulaic methods of drawing perspective, volumetrics, and the like. Students are encouraged to examine proportion, scale, light, shade, and texture, as well as means of expression, the nature and essence of objects, various media, and graphic composition. The course assists students in creating a comprehensive series of drawings and in building a portfolio.    Reading the City    ARTH-UA 677 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on observation and documentation of a historical section of New York City from its foundation to the present. Students participate in field walks and attend in-class lectures and discussions. A principal objective of the course is to have students learn to read the historical stratigraphy of the city by using primary and secondary sources such as maps, prints, and panoramas, as well as City Council minutes and other printed documents. The goal is to have them deepen their understanding of phenomena that they have observed firsthand.    Architectural Criticism    ARTH-UA 678 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director. Offered every year. 4 points.   Combines the reading and writing of architectural criticism. Students read the work of prewar and postwar architecture critics, focusing on those who live(d) and work(ed) in New York City and those who write and wrote for the popular press. Six class sessions are devoted to thematic groupings of reviews\u2014on the skyscraper, the museum, urban planning, and more\u2014in order to compare critical language, approach, and taste, while also tracking changes in architectural style from 1900 to the present. These reviews are supplemented with readings in architectural theory that attempt to define the styles of the past and present century. Students also write three reviews themselves, including one on a building, shop, or urban plan of their choice. The course should offer both an alternative history of 20th-century New York City and an opportunity to think and write about architecture in a new and opinionated way.    Parks, Plants, and People    ARTH-UA 679 Prerequisites: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601), Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661), and permission of the program director.
