As part of the core curriculum of the NYU Wagner Masters program, Capstone teams spend an academic year addressing challenges and identifying opportunities for a client organization or conducting research on a pressing social question. Wagner's Capstone program provides students with a centerpiece of their graduate experience whereby they are able to experience first-hand turning the theory of their studies into practice under the guidance of an experienced faculty member.

Over the course of an academic year, students in Capstone work in teams with faculty oversight to address challenges and identify opportunities for a client organization or to conduct research on a pressing social question.\u00a0   Capstone projects require students to get up-to-speed quickly on a specific content or issue area; enhance key process skills such as project management and teamwork; and develop competency in gathering, analyzing, and reporting out on data. For students, it's an opportunity to interweave their learning in all these areas and to do so in real time, in an unpredictable, complex, real-world environment; for organizations, it's a chance to have current and future public service leaders\u00a0focused on their success.

And now, as a Capstone client with Malaria No More, I am able to see firsthand the tremendous impact of the students\u2019 work. Wagner students recently completed a research study in Cameroon investigating the knowledge and practices of fever treatment, which we are using to inform our malaria education and communication efforts in the country. The students\u2019 dedication to the project not only made for a good working experience, but also ensured the quality of their work.               The final presentation was a tour de force!

Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum.          Congressional Research Service      Read more                         Congressional Research Service, ' 13        Public policy schools have increasingly sought to provide students a 'real world' consultative experience by building external research projects into the curriculum. This experience, often referred to as a 'capstone' project, provides students a chance to work with a public or private organization in need of policy research through a formal contractual agreement. Such research partnerships between academic institutions and the Congressional Research Service (CRS) have proven extremely successful in recent years, providing public policy students with invaluable experience, exposure to working with a federal government agency and to potential employment opportunities, while at the same time generating high quality research that will benefit Congress through the work that CRS performs. Top schools with programs of particular interest have been identified based on these efforts. These include Columbia University, New York University, Princeton, Syracuse, The University of Texas, Texas A&amp;M, George Washington University, Georgetown, and Carnegie-Mellon. These programs are well-established, are of sufficient length for students to accomplish substantive research and analysis on a significant project, are based on a team concept, are guided by hands-on faculty with expertise in the subject areas, and have the full support of the school administration.
