Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color.

Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color.

What Was   Is Now           Polytechnic Institute of New York University   NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering       Usage: Formal documents issued from the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering       NYU-Poly   NYU School of Engineering or School of Engineering         Usage: Second instance in article, paragraph, etc. for public view, or to internal and external audiences, e.g., correspondence to research partner at another institution. And all subsequent mentions in article, paragraph, etc. for public view; anywhere   Note: If &quot;Polytechnic&quot; is used, it must be used in conjunction with NYU, example: &quot;NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering.&quot;   Shortening it is allowed in two ways:   &quot;NYU School of Engineering&quot;       (Allowed in a formal or external document as a second mention)   OR   &quot;School of Engineering&quot;       (Allowed in a less formal setting [web, social media] where the context of NYU is already implied).         &quot;Poly&quot; is no longer in use         Templates   Presentations     PowerPoint template     Sample Stationery   See Stationery Specification for more details, including specifications for business cards and envelopes.     Sample Letter (Black)   Sample Letter (Color)     Logos   To establish the full identity of our school, the logo should be used in its official, unaltered official form, i.e., do not stretch, change colors, enlarge to the point of pixilation, manually type the letterforms, or otherwise modify the logo.   Note: If more than one school is mentioned, use the NYU logo instead of displaying the logos of multiple schools.   Please review Visual Identity Guidelines before using our logo.

Note: If more than one school is mentioned, use the NYU logo instead of displaying the logos of multiple schools.   Please review Visual Identity Guidelines before using our logo.

Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color.

Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color.
