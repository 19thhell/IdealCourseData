Including a substantial field-based component, our programs are based on communicative methods of second language acquisition and a reflective model of teaching which incorporate collaboration with colleagues, students, and community.    Our goal is to prepare professionals with a firm foundation in language, literacy, and applied linguistics along with an understanding of a range of second language teaching approaches that can be adjusted to suit the needs of different learner populations from diverse educational and ethnic backgrounds. The TESOL programs affirm the value of heritage languages and cultures and take an additive view of second language acquisition.    Post-Baccalaureate Advanced Certificate Program in TESOL    The post-baccalaureate advanced certificate is designed for students who are interested in teaching English abroad or choosing a second career in teaching English as a second/foreign language. It can be a bridge to the master's degree in TESOL.    For more information about the program, contact Shondel Nero .    Learn more about the application requirements for the post-baccalaureate advanced certificate program .    TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), M.A.    The master's degree programs prepare teachers of English to non-English speakers. Students can choose between a 34-credit program designed for teaching college students, adults, and TESOL in an international setting, and a 44-credit program for K-12 teaching in the United States which can lead to New York state certification.

Dual Certification: M.A. in Foreign Language Education (7-12) and TESOL (K-12)    This dual certification program enables students to learn to teach English as a second language (TESOL) and a target foreign language (French, Italian, Chinese, Japanese and Spanish) in grades 7-12. The program of study integrates second/foreign language pedagogy, linguistics, cross-cultural studies, and second language acquisition research.    Please note that we are not currently accepting applications for TESOL and the following foreign languages: German, Hebrew, Latin, or Russian, while these programs are under faculty review.

Dual Certification: Joint M.A. in Teaching French or Spanish as a Foreign Language (7-12) and TESOL (K-12)    These unique transatlantic programs, offered jointly with NYU Paris and NYU Madrid through the respective foreign language departments in the Graduate School of Arts and Science, combine two semesters in Paris or Madrid and two semesters in New York City.    The programs lead to eligibility for dual certification in Teaching French or Spanish for grades 7-12 and in Teaching English as a Second Language for grades K-12 in New York State.

Post-M.A. Certificate in TESOL    The post-M.A. (sixth-year) advanced certificate in TESOL is for second language teachers, supervisors, teacher trainers, administrators, and materials developers who wish to continue their study of TESOL beyond the master's level. The 30-point program can also serve as a bridge between master's and doctoral study.    For more information, contact Miriam Eisenstein Ebsworth .    Learn more about the application requirements for the post-M.A. certificate program .    TESOL, Ph.D    The doctoral program in TESOL emphasizes research in second language acquisition and pedagogy in linguistically and socially diverse environments and communities. Courses focus on issues of acquisition and use of English as a second or foreign language including pedagogy and research, intercultural communication, alternative research methodologies, and educational foundations.

The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

Including a substantial field-based component, our programs are based on communicative methods of second language acquisition and a reflective model of teaching which incorporate collaboration with colleagues, students, and community.    Our goal is to prepare professionals with a firm foundation in language, literacy, and applied linguistics along with an understanding of a range of second language teaching approaches that can be adjusted to suit the needs of different learner populations from diverse educational and ethnic backgrounds. The TESOL programs affirm the value of heritage languages and cultures and take an additive view of second language acquisition.    Post-Baccalaureate Advanced Certificate Program in TESOL    The post-baccalaureate advanced certificate is designed for students who are interested in teaching English abroad or choosing a second career in teaching English as a second/foreign language. It can be a bridge to the master's degree in TESOL.    For more information about the program, contact Shondel Nero .    Learn more about the application requirements for the post-baccalaureate advanced certificate program .    TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages), M.A.    The master's degree programs prepare teachers of English to non-English speakers. Students can choose between a 34-credit program designed for teaching college students, adults, and TESOL in an international setting, and a 44-credit program for K-12 teaching in the United States which can lead to New York state certification.
