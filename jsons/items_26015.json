Today artists working in the field of social practice focus on aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, media strategies, & social activism as central issues that inform their artworks & projects that are designed for public & social spaces. In the United States, visual art that engaged the public directly began in the late 1950s & coincided with the local \u201cdecentralization\u201d efforts that, in the arts, resulted in community-based art practices that envisioned the public as diverse, socially-engaged, & contributed to an expansive aesthetic consciousness. Understanding this history contextualizes social practice art & allows us to interrogate the ways artists blur the lines between object making, performance, activism, grass roots organizing & pedagogy.

Imagination is assumed to be the primary resource for artists, one that is best used by rejecting constraints through an attitude of limitlessness & radical personal freedom. It is celebrated for its ability to enable people to \u2018think outside the box,\u2019 to innovate & to surprise. Anarchy, as a social & political idea, receives a far more ambivalent welcome. From it\u2019s linguistic roots meaning \u2019without a rule,\u2019 it would seem to be a fellow traveler to the imagination, seeking to scale up the trans-formative potential of the imagination to a social & political scale. But if it is a change in scale, it is one that then challenges use to examine closely the implications of the imagination & to engage with the full complexity of anarchy. The course will explore these ideas through a range of texts by authors such as Andre Breton, Leo Tolstoy, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emma Goldman. Murray Rothbard, Murray Bookchin, David Graeber, & Hakim Bey. Finally, we will consider the questions of lawlessness, violence & insurrection by looking at the writings of Valerie Solanas, the Unibomber, Tiqqun & the Anonomous Collective.

The class will look at the content of artwork, including ideas in contemporary & traditional arts, both Chinese & international, & build various skills to translate ideas into reality. With the medium of Ink, students will use their living experience in Shanghai to integrate & create artwork, with the influences of art that they have been exposed to, personal influences they have experiences, &/or the societal landscape that they see around them. Students will work on individual projects using ink to create paintings, sculpture, or multimedia art. Class time will be devoted to individual & group critiques, lectures, class discussions, & visits to local artists, galleries, & museums. A journal will be kept to record ideas, sketches, references & future plans. By the close of the semester, each students will have a complete body of artwork & participate in an exhibition.

Questions of authenticity & personal revelation will be discussed as they relate to contemporary art practice. Students will complete three studio projects that reflect these & related issues. Because this is an interdisciplinary studio course, any medium, e.g., painting, photo, performance, installation, video, sculpture, drawing, digital, is acceptable as a means to explore class content.

At what point does the obvious become the extraordinary? This course will reexamine the realm of obviousness, clich\u00e9, & boredom as alternate strategies for affecting disappearance both as an art practice as well as a possible act of transgression. Theoretical & literary topics include Michel Foucault, Paul Virillo as well as the science fiction writer Samuel Delaney. We will also be screening films by Georges Melies, Kenneth Anger, & Swiss artist Roman Signer.

We will trace the way these processes are channeled through a language of signs & symbols. The crucial role of visual images within each of these processes will be explored through examples taken from the readings as well as from slide lectures & films by contemporary artists. Designed to provide a set of analytical tools that can be used to interrogate & expand the artistic process, the use of artwork, writing, assignments, & group discussion will provide regular opportunities for students to respond & reflect on the topics introduced.

The goal of the course is to help the student sharpen his/her point-of-view and to develop constructive motivational tools. To aid in the process we will address the conflict between such binaries as: art and craft, art and ideas and the social and physical space of art. Our method will include individual studio meetings, group critiques, presentations and exhibitions of art. Readings and exhibitions will be assigned according to students\u2019 particular research needs. They may include; Philip Fisher, \"Making and Effacing Art\"; Craig Owens, \"Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power and Culture\u201d and James Hillman, \"The Dream and the Underworld\", as well as student suggested readings.

To that end the class will study the relevant writings of Michael Foucault, Roland Barthes and Walter Benjamin while students create a body of work over the semester. Films and artists to be viewed will include Todd Haynes, Jean Luc Godard, Nicki Lee, Vito Acconci and Federico Fellini. In this class, the presentation and discussion of readings, films, and visual art will alternate with individual studio visits and group critiques of student work. Critiques of student projects will consider the philosophical and cultural implications of artistic activity. Students will work in an interdisciplinary manner, using media of their own choosing to explore their forms and ideas within the context of the course's readings and class discussions. Student will also spend time presenting their work and that of other artists to help them develop a vocabulary for discussing and understanding their production as they move towards their thesis project. The course objective is to empower students by expanding their perspectives and skills in artmaking, discussion and critique.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

Color as a phenomenon is one of the most powerful tools in the artist\u2019s repertoire. It\u2019s relation to perception lies at the heart of our notions of the objective & the subjective. Color will be explored in depth through a series of open-ended projects & a series of short experiment/ assignments.

The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE 2974            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Exhibition Making           A studio course that combines multidisciplinary creative practices & scholarship through the framework of curating & exhibition making. Students will gain hands on experience through the mentorship of guest artists & curators who are presenting exhibitions, in conjunction with the course, at the Art Department\u2019s 80WSE Gallery. Additionally, students will collaborate with these guests on all aspects of production for their projects, including exhibition design, historical research, assembling an exhibition catalogue, borrowing art works from museums & private collections. The activities covered move beyond studio practice, offering primary information & unique insight into the many concerns that comprise any public presentation of artwork.

The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure will at once expose students to the ideas of limits & how the limit or horizon of the possible can be elaborated & expanded on in art. Students will engage in-group & one-on-one discussion of projects made in response to readings & assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration & consistency in a creative practice.

These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, & music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live. We will look at how artists utilize these structure as a means to change the way we experience life & living. Each week will be geared towards a specific institution through slide lectures, screenings of films, field trips, & guest artists. There will also be presentations & critiques of student work as well as special topics of interest.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               45    3            ART-UE 1981            Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Sex and Contemporary Art           This interdisciplinary class combines studio practice & critique with slide lectures, readings, audiovisual material & visits to relevant exhibitions. The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure will at once expose students to the ideas of limits & how the limit or horizon of the possible can be elaborated & expanded on in art. Students will engage in-group & one-on-one discussion of projects made in response to readings & assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration & consistency in a creative practice.

These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, & music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live. We will look at how artists utilize these structure as a means to change the way we experience life & living. Each week will be geared towards a specific institution through slide lectures, screenings of films, field trips, & guest artists. There will also be presentations & critiques of student work as well as special topics of interest.

Today artists working in the field of social practice focus on aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, media strategies, & social activism as central issues that inform their artworks & projects that are designed for public & social spaces. In the United States, visual art that engaged the public directly began in the late 1950s & coincided with the local \u201cdecentralization\u201d efforts that, in the arts, resulted in community-based art practices that envisioned the public as diverse, socially-engaged, & contributed to an expansive aesthetic consciousness. Understanding this history contextualizes social practice art & allows us to interrogate the ways artists blur the lines between object making, performance, activism, grass roots organizing & pedagogy.

Imagination is assumed to be the primary resource for artists, one that is best used by rejecting constraints through an attitude of limitlessness & radical personal freedom. It is celebrated for its ability to enable people to \u2018think outside the box,\u2019 to innovate & to surprise. Anarchy, as a social & political idea, receives a far more ambivalent welcome. From it\u2019s linguistic roots meaning \u2019without a rule,\u2019 it would seem to be a fellow traveler to the imagination, seeking to scale up the trans-formative potential of the imagination to a social & political scale. But if it is a change in scale, it is one that then challenges use to examine closely the implications of the imagination & to engage with the full complexity of anarchy. The course will explore these ideas through a range of texts by authors such as Andre Breton, Leo Tolstoy, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emma Goldman. Murray Rothbard, Murray Bookchin, David Graeber, & Hakim Bey. Finally, we will consider the questions of lawlessness, violence & insurrection by looking at the writings of Valerie Solanas, the Unibomber, Tiqqun & the Anonomous Collective.

The class will look at the content of artwork, including ideas in contemporary & traditional arts, both Chinese & international, & build various skills to translate ideas into reality. With the medium of Ink, students will use their living experience in Shanghai to integrate & create artwork, with the influences of art that they have been exposed to, personal influences they have experiences, &/or the societal landscape that they see around them. Students will work on individual projects using ink to create paintings, sculpture, or multimedia art. Class time will be devoted to individual & group critiques, lectures, class discussions, & visits to local artists, galleries, & museums.

The goal of the course is to help the student sharpen his/her point-of-view and to develop constructive motivational tools. To aid in the process we will address the conflict between such binaries as: art and craft, art and ideas and the social and physical space of art. Our method will include individual studio meetings, group critiques, presentations and exhibitions of art. Readings and exhibitions will be assigned according to students\u2019 particular research needs. They may include; Philip Fisher, \"Making and Effacing Art\"; Craig Owens, \"Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power and Culture\u201d and James Hillman, \"The Dream and the Underworld\", as well as student suggested readings.

To that end the class will study the relevant writings of Michael Foucault, Roland Barthes and Walter Benjamin while students create a body of work over the semester. Films and artists to be viewed will include Todd Haynes, Jean Luc Godard, Nicki Lee, Vito Acconci and Federico Fellini. In this class, the presentation and discussion of readings, films, and visual art will alternate with individual studio visits and group critiques of student work. Critiques of student projects will consider the philosophical and cultural implications of artistic activity. Students will work in an interdisciplinary manner, using media of their own choosing to explore their forms and ideas within the context of the course's readings and class discussions. Student will also spend time presenting their work and that of other artists to help them develop a vocabulary for discussing and understanding their production as they move towards their thesis project. The course objective is to empower students by expanding their perspectives and skills in artmaking, discussion and critique.

Still in it's infancy - the first film was made in 1895 - it is a form that has quickly evolved from the desire to capture motion, generating almost as many uses & traditions both conceptual & material as there are makers. Through screenings, readings, lectures & discussions this course investigates the ways in which certain artists have used film and video to explore meaning, experiment with form, & reshape the way we see.

From the most ancient of civilizations to the present moment, mural works attach themselves to architecture & become statements about the function & social implications of the architectural site. This social implication, long recognized by the patrons, governments & institutions that allow them, has been of vital importance to understandings of the idea of the artist as an individual.      Course Page               40    4            ART-GE 2980            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art           Integrates the theory & practice of contemporary art, combining studio projects with reading assignments that address the larger philosophical & cultural implications of artistic activity. These praxis courses allow students to work in an interdisicplinary manner, using media of their own choosing to explore & respond to issues raised by assigned readings & class discussions at an advanced level. Course topics will vary from semester to semester. Past topics have included Environmental Monitoring, Visionaries & Saboteurs, & Sex & Contemporary Art.

Areas of exploration include relief printmaking -\u00ad linoleum & woodblocks, silkscreening on varied surfaces, as well as practices in contemporary photography, including but not limited to the digital realm. The conceptual focus for this interdisciplinary course is that all art is created in dialogue, referencing art history & process, in response to specific societal, environmental or political issues.      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE 2973            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Art of Collective Practice           Within the field of contemporary art, particularly amongst artists & art collectives that produce socially/politically engaged work, there is a widespread use of creative practices that put collaboration at the heart of their methodology, & frequently rely on collaborative relationships with community-based organizations. What impact can we have in our communities that supports critical dialogues within & between a broad range of political, economic, & social contexts? In this class we will explore this & other questions first through a series of exercises in the studio & then later with community partners.      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE-GE 2987            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Articulating Visual Art           Articulating Visual Arts is designed to help students express & sharpen their thinking & writing about visual art.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

Color as a phenomenon is one of the most powerful tools in the artist\u2019s repertoire. It\u2019s relation to perception lies at the heart of our notions of the objective & the subjective. Color will be explored in depth through a series of open-ended projects & a series of short experiment/ assignments.      Course Page               30    3            ART-GE 2983            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Environmental Art Activism           Contemporary environmentalism is an issue dominated by scientific, technical & policy discourse. The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE 2974            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Exhibition Making           A studio course that combines multidisciplinary creative practices & scholarship through the framework of curating & exhibition making. Students will gain hands on experience through the mentorship of guest artists & curators who are presenting exhibitions, in conjunction with the course, at the Art Department\u2019s 80WSE Gallery. Additionally, students will collaborate with these guests on all aspects of production for their projects, including exhibition design, historical research, assembling an exhibition catalogue, borrowing art works from museums & private collections. The activities covered move beyond studio practice, offering primary information & unique insight into the many concerns that comprise any public presentation of artwork.

The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE 2986            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: The Line that Draws the Horizon           Is a class for experienced students constructed around a series of projects realized in any available media or medium. How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               45    3            ART-UE 1981            Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Sex and Contemporary Art           This interdisciplinary class combines studio practice & critique with slide lectures, readings, audiovisual material & visits to relevant exhibitions. The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.
