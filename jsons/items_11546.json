Professor Emily Apter and Professor Jacques Lezra's translation of Barbara Cassin's Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon is out now from Princeton University Press! This is an encyclopedic dictionary of close to 400 important philosophical, literary, and political terms and concepts that defy easy--or any--translation from one language and culture to another. Drawn from more than a dozen languages, terms such as Dasein (German), pravda (Russian), saudade (Portuguese), and stato (Italian) are thoroughly examined in all their cross-linguistic and cross-cultural complexities. Spanning the classical, medieval, early modern, modern, and contemporary periods, these are terms that influence thinking across the humanities.

Rimbaud, la commune de Paris et l'invention de l'histoire spatiale is published by Les Prairies Ordinaires.

Professor Cristina Vatulescu was promoted to the position of associate professor with tenure, effective 9/1/2013. Congratulations, Cristina!     Emily Apter 's Book Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability is out now from Verso Books! The book argues for a rethinking of comparative literature focusing on the problems that emerge when large-scale paradigms of literary studies ignore the politics of the \u201cUntranslatable\u201d\u2014the realm of those words that are continually retranslated, mistranslated, transferred from language to language, or especially resistant to substitution.      Hala Halim 's Book Alexandrian Cosmopolitanism: An Archive is forthcoming from Fordham University Press. Interrogating how Alexandria became enshrined as the exemplary cosmopolitan space in the Middle East, this book mounts a radical critique of Eurocentric conceptions of cosmopolitanism. The dominant account of Alexandrian cosmopolitanism elevates things European in the city's culture and simultaneously places things Egyptian under the sign of decline. The book goes beyond this civilization/barbarism binary to trace other modes of intercultural solidarity.      Visiting Scholars for 2013-2014 :  Alice Blackhurst is   in the second year of her PhD in the French department at the University   of Cambridge. Her dissertation centers around ideas of luxury in   contemporary French thought, art and film.

Sagi Cohen is a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of   Ottawa, supervised by Dr. Dalie Giroux. His Dissertation - Homo   Perfidus: An Antipathology - tries to construct a \"responsible\" concept   of betrayal; a methodology. His guide through this Inferno is an   appropriately unholy matrimony between Nietzsche and Levinas, which   helps approach the accusation of 'traitor' in a   trans-valuative/affirmative manner; not a persecution of prejudgment,   but a phenomenological erring toward its trace(s) (as an ethics, as   philosophia prima).    News for 2012-2013 Professors Kamau  Brathwaite, John Chioles, Daniel Javitch , and Timothy Reiss have recently retired and been named Professor  Emeriti of Comparative Literature.

New Faculty Members       We're happy to announce six(!) new faculty members.  Having long been \"associated faculty\" and valuable contributors to  the department and discipline of comparative literature, Professors Emily  Apter , Gabriela Basterra , Ulrich Baer , and Avital Ronell became  voting joint faculty in January, 2006. With one foot in their original  departments and one in Comp Lit, they now join fully in our comparative mix.  The exciting results of last year's faculty searches, Assistant Professors Cristina  Vatulescu and Hala Halim also join our department in 2006-07.  Professor Vatulescu's research interest include aesthetics and politics;  artistic and extra-artistic genres, in particular the novel, autobiography, and  the police file; Russian and Eastern European twentieth century culture; cinema  and visual culture.

Translated from the French, these two pieces are poetic explorations of  animals, humans and the origins of language. In addition, Sieburth has included  Michaux's ideogrammic ink drawings to illustrate the explosive and  contemplative nature of the writer's verbal and pictorial gestures.      Professor Mark Sanders 's book Gayatri Chakravorty  Spivak: Live Theory has recently been published by Continuum International  Publishing Group. Concentrating on the thought of one of the world's most  provocative and original theorists, this book delves into Spivak's theories on  deconstruction, Marxisim, feminism and issues of postcoloniality and  globalization.

Kamau Brathwaite Wins Griffin Poetry Prize!       At a gala event in Toronto, Ontario ,  Professor Kamau Brathwaite was awarded the prestigious Griffen Poetry Prize  for his new volume of widely-acclaimed poetry Born to Slow Horses . The  Canadian-based Griffin Prize is the world's most valuable prize for poetry. In  the course of his career as a major contemporary poet and voice of the  Caribbean, Professor Brathwaite has also been awarded the Neustadt  International Prize for Literature,   Cuba's Casa de  las Americas Premio, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Fulbright Fellowship.       We are pleased to announce the promotion of Professor Ana  Maria Dopico to Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and Associate  Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; of Professor Mikhail Iampolski to  Professor of Comparative Literature and Professor of Russian and Slavic  Studies; and of Professor Xudong Zhang to Professor of Comparative  Literature and Professor of East Asian Studies.

A collection of Professor Zhang's  essays since 1985, Traces of Criticism: Essays in Cultural Theory and  Cultural Criticism , has recently appeared, as has his Cultural Identity  in the Age of Globalization .           Professor Kamau Brathwaite 's latest book of poetry,  from Wesleyan University Press, Born to Slow Horses, is a collection of  poetic meditations on islands and exile, language and ritual, and the force of  personal and historical passion and grief. In addition to unearthing the roots  of the Carribean culture, Brathwaite's experiences with New York City and 9/11 provide a modern  influence on his work. The subject of Brathwaite's poems run the gamut from the  slave children to BMW luxury cars. This eclectic mix provides insight into the  author's experiences with the history of the Carribean and the modern western  world.          CHINA TRIP! Professor Xudong Zhang organized and led  a delegaton of ten NYU graduate students to Shenzhen, Shanghai,  and Beijing to  participate in Sino-US symposia on comparative literature.

Weaving philosophy and humanity, its twelve whimsical stories bring the likes  of Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer, Heliodorus, and Shakespeare into the lives of  street urchins, displaced persons, and haunted students. As the Kastaniotis  description of Romeo the Pothead and Juliet the Snitch notes, \"A  burning fire hovers over these short stories. The conflagration is both real  and figurative, as deportation, immigration, exile....\" The Department of English at Morehouse College  in Atlanta is  sponsoring a Caribbean Literary Studies Symposium , to be held April  13-14, whose focus, and one of whose participants, will be Professor Kamau  Brathwaite .

Professor   Richard Sieburth 's new translation of Georg B\u00fcchner's Lenz has  just been published, in a lovely edition, by Archipelago Books. Harold Bloom  has called the volume \"both a superb version and a startling  interpretation of a great and vital work\"; Michael Palmer writes that,  \"for the first time, thanks to Richard Sieburth's astonishing skills, we  have a version in English that respects and communicates the radical  inventiveness and stylistic singularity of the original.\"      Professor   Nancy Ruttenburg has been invited to deliver the prestigious Ian Watt  Lecture on the History and Theory of the Novel at Stanford University.  The lecture, entitled \"Simplifying the Novel,\" will be given on  January 18th at the Center for the Study of the Novel, which has recently  fallen under the direction of Professor Margaret Cohen.

King , both of whom received their Ph.D.s from  the Department, are participants in a conference entitled \"Yari Yari  Pamberi: Black Women Writers Dissecting Globalization\" to be held October  12-16. \"The goal of this conference,\" its organizers state,  \"is to expand and intensify debates around globalization, explore  possibilities and contradictions, continue strengthening ties among women of  African descent, promote their literature, create a platform for young emerging  writers and raise public awareness about global developments.\" Fulani will  be among those addressing the question of \"the impact of new technologies  and globalization on Literature, Publishing and Distribution\"; King will  take part in a reading and discussion at the Poets' House. Other speakers  include Professor Manthia Diawara , Maya Angelou, Lucille Clifton,  Octavia Butler, Gloria Naylor, Alice Walker, and Edwidge Danticat.      Professors   Andrew Ross and Kristin Ross are the editors of Anti-Americanism ,  a collection of essays published in October by NYU Press. The volume, whose  contributors include, in addition to its editors, Professor Ana Maria Dopico   and CompLit associated faculty member Mary Louise Pratt , offers  considerations of anti-American opinion and sentiment in Latin America, the  Middle East, Europe, East Asia, and the United States, and provides what Neil  Smith calls \"the best, most comprehensive and most critical survey of  anti-Americanism available.\"                                                                             Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

New Faculty Members       We're happy to announce six(!) new faculty members.  Having long been \"associated faculty\" and valuable contributors to  the department and discipline of comparative literature, Professors Emily  Apter , Gabriela Basterra , Ulrich Baer , and Avital Ronell became  voting joint faculty in January, 2006. With one foot in their original  departments and one in Comp Lit, they now join fully in our comparative mix.  The exciting results of last year's faculty searches, Assistant Professors Cristina  Vatulescu and Hala Halim also join our department in 2006-07.  Professor Vatulescu's research interest include aesthetics and politics;  artistic and extra-artistic genres, in particular the novel, autobiography, and  the police file; Russian and Eastern European twentieth century culture; cinema  and visual culture. A joint appointment with Middle Eastern and Islamic  Studies, Professor Halim will begin in January 2007. Her first Comp Lit course  will be a graduate seminar \"Postcoloniality and Translation\" and her  cross-listed undergraduate course from MEIS will be \"Topics in Modern  Arabic Culture: Globalization and the Middle East.\"            New Faculty Books       Professor Richard Sieburth 's latest book from Archipelago Books, Stroke  by Stroke, is a pairing of two of Henri Michaux's most suggestive texts.  Translated from the French, these two pieces are poetic explorations of  animals, humans and the origins of language. In addition, Sieburth has included  Michaux's ideogrammic ink drawings to illustrate the explosive and  contemplative nature of the writer's verbal and pictorial gestures.      Professor Mark Sanders 's book Gayatri Chakravorty  Spivak: Live Theory has recently been published by Continuum International  Publishing Group. Concentrating on the thought of one of the world's most  provocative and original theorists, this book delves into Spivak's theories on  deconstruction, Marxisim, feminism and issues of postcoloniality and  globalization. A concise, comprehensive and accessible text, Sanders's latest work  explores Spivak's own questions about literacy and intellectual responsibility,  and also includes a new interview with Spivak herself.          Kamau Brathwaite Wins Griffin Poetry Prize!       At a gala event in Toronto, Ontario ,  Professor Kamau Brathwaite was awarded the prestigious Griffen Poetry Prize  for his new volume of widely-acclaimed poetry Born to Slow Horses . The  Canadian-based Griffin Prize is the world's most valuable prize for poetry. In  the course of his career as a major contemporary poet and voice of the  Caribbean, Professor Brathwaite has also been awarded the Neustadt  International Prize for Literature,   Cuba's Casa de  las Americas Premio, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Fulbright Fellowship.       We are pleased to announce the promotion of Professor Ana  Maria Dopico to Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and Associate  Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; of Professor Mikhail Iampolski to  Professor of Comparative Literature and Professor of Russian and Slavic  Studies; and of Professor Xudong Zhang to Professor of Comparative  Literature and Professor of East Asian Studies.

Professor Iampolski received the Andrei Bely Prize in Literature for his Physiology  of the Symbolic , released last year. A collection of Professor Zhang's  essays since 1985, Traces of Criticism: Essays in Cultural Theory and  Cultural Criticism , has recently appeared, as has his Cultural Identity  in the Age of Globalization .           Professor Kamau Brathwaite 's latest book of poetry,  from Wesleyan University Press, Born to Slow Horses, is a collection of  poetic meditations on islands and exile, language and ritual, and the force of  personal and historical passion and grief. In addition to unearthing the roots  of the Carribean culture, Brathwaite's experiences with New York City and 9/11 provide a modern  influence on his work. The subject of Brathwaite's poems run the gamut from the  slave children to BMW luxury cars. This eclectic mix provides insight into the  author's experiences with the history of the Carribean and the modern western  world.          CHINA TRIP! Professor Xudong Zhang organized and led  a delegaton of ten NYU graduate students to Shenzhen, Shanghai,  and Beijing to  participate in Sino-US symposia on comparative literature.

We will read them in translation, but those with sufficient  Arabic competence are encouraged to read the original, or to work comparatively  between the Arabic and English versions.      Rather than a developmental model, in which  modern and contemporary Arabic literature are gauged by how far they have  advanced in relation to Western literary achievement, this course attends to  how literary works function as nodes around which cluster various consequences  \u2013 literary and extra-literary \u2013 and engage with the environments in which they  were written. Participants are encouraged to consider texts through the prisms  of their multiple contexts \u2013 the historical, the social and the cultural, as  well as gender and class \u2013 while attending to them, in contrapuntal fashion, as  works of art.      This course is reading intensive (about  150-200 pages per week) and requires thoughtful analysis of literary texts. We  will consider texts of varying pedigrees: our rallying point in all of our  readings will be the formal elements of the text, such as theme, plot, style  and character. As we discuss these elements, we will investigate how these  works represent modern and contemporary Arab experience, including issues of  modernity and tradition, displacement, migration and exile, oppression and  resistance as well as shifting notions of the nation. We will consider a  variety of perspectives and critical interventions; at all times, we will  consider how literature is, means and does.       Topics in French Literature: An Introduction to Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) Nouis      From Derrida\u2019s critique of  \u201cWestern\u201d categorizations of universality and rationality (logocentrism,  phallogocentrism, humanism, anthropocentrism), to his later reflections on  metaphoricity, translation, and performativity, this course will first explore  the question of \u201cwriting\u201d as it unfolds throughout the 1960\u2019s and beyond. We will  then focus on the more directly political and ethical dimension of Derrida\u2019s  thought, and carefully examine his use of concepts such as hos(ti)pitality,  gift, forgiveness, animality, friendship, faith, and \"\u00e9v\u00e9nement,\"  paying particular attention to his later conversation with Emmanuel Levinas.  Readings will include passages, chapters and essays taken from Writing and  difference (1967), On Grammatology  (1967), Psyche. Inventions of the other (1987), Points..., (1992); Force of Law  (1994); Politics of Friendship (1994); Monolinguism of the Other (1996) ; Of  Hospitality (1997) ; On Cosmopolitanism and Forgiveness (1997); Philosophy in a Time of Terror (2003); The  Beast and the Sovereign (2008), etc. The course and the readings will be in  English. Topics in Labor and the Global Market: Literature, Film &amp; History Forman Globalization has become a  much-debated and deeply controversial topic. In this class, we will focus on  the ways that labor has been represented and understood, especially in  relationship to the development of capitalism in its global form. We will  explore how the movement of capital, commodities, and workers across the globe  and with seeming indifference to national borders shapes the idea of work and  those who perform it. Of equal importance in our study will be the way that  work transforms the structure of the global economy. Some primary questions we  will explore are: How has the demand for labor required migration and imposed  geographical dislocations? How does labor create value within these new  locations? How do some gain control of the work of others? How do workers  organize themselves and develop community in new locations? How does this  relationship of power change over time? Some likely texts for the course  include: Shakespeare, The Tempest; Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s postcolonial play, I  will Marry When I Want; a Haitian novel about a sugar cane worker who migrates  to the Dominican Republic. We will place these fictional texts in conversation  with visual representations by Diego Rivera, works by Marx, by anthropologists  and narrative filmmakers on sex tourism and domestic labor, and by documentary  filmmakers and historians on global corporations and utopian economies.  Topics: What is Critique? Huber      The philosopher  and theorist Michel Foucault argued that critique is a powerful form of  insubordination and a crucial \u201cinstrument for those who fight, resist, and who  no longer want what is.\u201d But how might critical philosophy, which trades in  ideas, help us combat material and pervasive forms of injustice? What is  theory\u2019s relationship to praxis and to politics, and what kind of theory or  practice is critique? The seminar begins with a consideration of the uneasy  place of critique in the western philosophical tradition. We will read Kant,  Marx, Foucault, Butler, Mahmood and Mbembe among others, in order to establish  a sense of how critique emerges as a mode of radical questioning, an art of  unsettling self-evident answers and interfering with established relations of  power. We will consider what the practice of critique entails, and what it  means to suggest, as these authors do, that critique interrogates the  historically specific relationships between power, truth and the subject. In  the last third of the class, we will focus on queer of color critique (Mu\u00f1oz,  Ferguson, Reddy, and Chen), a relatively recent body of scholarship that  exemplifies the urgency, risk and daring of critique as a critical  practice.   Hellscapes and Elysia in the Renaissance and Beyond McHugh     This course explores various representations of otherworlds,  both infernal and paradisal: the realms of the afterlife, regions of marvel or  idyllic bliss, political utopias and dystopias. Readings and discussion focus  on how these imagined lands reflect, critique, and animate the real world, from  antiquity through our own times. The Age of  angst: German and Austrian Intellectual History, 1890-1938 George      This course  explores the profound sense of crisis, uncertainty, and anxiety that pervaded  German and Austrian experience in the late nineteenth and early twentieth  centuries. The era\u2019s radical changes\u2014among them the traumas of war, rapid  industrialization and urbanization, shifting gender roles, and the political  and economic instability of the interwar years\u2014seemed to shake the very bedrock  upon which society had been built. The intellectual responses to this pervasive  sense of upheaval and angst, as well as the challenges and changes themselves,  form the focus of this course, as we explore the relationship between modernity  and crisis in early twentieth-century Germany and Austria. Readings will  include Nietzsche, Freud, Simmel, Weber, Kracauer, Benjamin, and Heidegger.  Introduction  to Theory \u2013 German Media Theory: From Aesthetics to Cultural Techniques Smith      This course  presents a survey of the German strain of media theory from the perspective of  the persistent interchanges and parallels between it and social thought and  forms. We will follow a trajectory that can be roughly outlined by four  movements: 1) Media theory\u2019s ancestors in classical philosophy; 2) The boom in  aesthetic theory that took place in 18th-century German philosophy, one still  based in a humanistic understanding of the world; 3) late 20th-century  discussions of discourse networks and systems theory, which attempt to  de-center the human subject in favor of an understanding of the technical  forces that drive history; and 4) the contemporary understanding of the  intertwined nature of technical media and culture proposed in the school of  \u201ccultural techniques.\u201d Thus this course additionally addresses the ways in  which Media Studies provides a template for understanding the ethical, legal,  and social position of human subject in the \u201cdigital\u201d and technologically  mediated world.  Re-imagining Greek Tragedy: Context, Influence and Performance Taxidou The   encounters with Greek Tragedy throughout the ages have not only shaped   our understanding of theatre in the Western canon, but have also   informed basic concepts and theories of classicism, neo-classicism and   humanism more broadly. A privileged genre in aesthetic theory, its   powerful roles (like Clytemnestra, Oedipus, Antigone) have had a huge   impact on modern thinking, from psychoanalysis and philosophy to legal   and political theory. This course will take an interdisciplinary   approach to Greek Tragedy, bringing together critical languages from   Classics, Theatre Studies, Performance Theory, but also philosophy and   critical theory. Through a series of close readings of key   play-texts by the three tragedians--Aeschylus, Sophocles and   Euripes--this course will analyse the development of Greek tragedy as a   dramatic genre and vehicle for performance within the context of the   democratic city-state. It will also look at the ways these texts have   been re-written and re-imagined for performance within the broader   context of modernity. Literature &amp; Society in the Middle East Igsiz Examines selected works in translation of leading 20th-century poets,   novelists, and short story writers that reflect changing conditions and   mores within Middle Eastern and North African societies. Investigates   such topics as conflicts between traditionalists and modernists, the   impact of urbanization on rural societies, and the existential dilemmas   of men and women.
