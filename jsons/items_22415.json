The NYU School of Professional Studies High School Academy is now offering weekend workshops to provide high school students with programs of study that allow them to explore their professional options and to enhance their college portfolio.     These workshops are offered in condensed, weekend formats and are taught by top industry experts. They offer rigorous coursework and serve as an impressive addition on a college application.   Spring workshops begin in February, and the deadline to apply is February 16, 2015 . Space is limited.           In order to qualify for the program, students must be between the ages of 15-19.
