Emphasis is on literature, language, and civilization. Civilization is interpreted here as including broader cultural works affecting the study of literature, including the theater and the cinema. Recent departmental interests include German exile literature; war and literature; German critical theory; and immigrant writing in German.   The collection also supports course work and research in the following programs: Comparative Literature; Dramatic Literature, Theatre History, and the Cinema; Literature in Translation; Women's Studies; and the Foreign Language Education Program at the School of Education.   The interdisciplinary approach of courses and research within the German department are supported by the various pertinent collections in art, history, philosophy, and the social sciences.                 Scope       Language   The collection consists principally of literary texts and criticism in German. Works of major authors are also collected in English translation. Criticism, literary history, and theory are collected in German as well as in English. Works written  in other Western European languages are collected very selectively.       Geographical Areas   Coverage includes a major emphasis on German literature of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, and a representative body of German literature from the German immigrant (\"Ausl&auml;nder - Immigranten - Gastarbeiter\") community.       Chronological Periods   Coverage of German literature is from the medieval period to the present with current emphasis on the late 18th, and the 19th and 20th centuries.                     Types of Materials         Included    Monographs, monographic series, serials, newspapers, proceedings, facsimiles, reprints, microforms, audio-visual and electronic media (including electronic texts). Exhibition catalogs and dissertations are acquired very selectively.          Excluded    Dissertations when requested only for individual research, manuscripts, textbooks, ephemera, maps.                      Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   The retrospective collection of 19th-century literature is a strong research collection, especially for primary and secondary resources on Goethe and Schiller. More generally, special emphasis is placed on the literature dating from 1750 to the  present, as well as on the works of modern philosophers and theorists (e.g., Habermas) and sociologists (e.g., U. Jaeggi and R. Dahrendorf).   Recently, efforts have been made to retrospectively collect important critical editions not acquired in the past. Furthermore, special attention has been paid to World War I, Weimar, pacifist and emigr&eacute; literature. This included the  acquisition of a private library of German literature imprints from the 20s and 30s and special collection items relating to pacifism, and literature and war.   The teaching of German language and linguistics and faculty research in this area have decreased; therefore, works are now selected quite stringently. However, there is an interest in research on second language acquisition.   Works in literary criticism, history, and theory, as well as subsidiary works relating to broader aspects of German culture important to literary research, are carefully selected so as to reflect the Department's needs and to maintain a  representative collection of primary and secondary sources in all centuries.   Continuing efforts will focus on the development of a collection with particular strengths in the late 18th century and the 19th and 20th centuries, the acquisition of multiple copies of works in heavy demand, and the systematic identification  and replacement of missing or worn volumes of standard works.                 Other Resources      Erich Maria Remarque's library and papers are available in Special Collections.    Instructional materials (including language tapes acquired by the language lab) are available in the Lewis Levine Language Laboratory.

Organized around a crucial body of literary and philosophical texts, which includes canonical and non-traditional works, our department is both forward-looking and responsible to established scholarship. We offer students a challenging course of studies that opens up interdisciplinary initiatives and stresses theoretical sophistication. In offering students a curriculum that emphasizes the critical study of these discourses, we prepare our graduates for distinguished academic careers in an intellectually complex environment at a time when borderlines between disciplines are becoming increasingly permeable.    The departmental interest in critical thought formalizes this aspect of the program's orientation, for which it has become known. The activities of the department, courses, lectures, visiting professors, reflect the fact that the heritage of German theory, linguistic, aesthetic, philosophic and political, are the pivotal points out of which the widest range of twentieth and twenty-first century theory has grown, and without which they cannot be properly understood.    For students who choose to concentrate their work in the study of German literary texts we offer rigorous training in contemporary methods of interpretation. We also greatly welcome those whose interests include a more theoretical bent. Thus the program encourages taking German critical thought as a point of departure for a wide range of investigations. Because New York University is exceptionally strong in all areas of the humanities and because we have forged strong ties to other departments, we are pleased to see our students make full use of its exceptional resources. The graduate program has been conceived to encourage and guide each student in designing his or her individual course of study. At the same time we stress tailoring each program of study to make the student competitive in constantly evolving academic market.    The department consistently recruits highly distinguished faculty. Our faculty is widely published and internationally active in areas of scholarship that command the attention of colleagues and students across the disciplines. Internationally recognized scholars and thinkers play an active role in our department. The Department of German, along with the Departments of English and French, sponsored the fall semester visits of Jacques Derrida. Our current visiting professors are Elizabeth Bronfen and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek. Past visitors include Susan Bernstein, Hartmut Boehme, Ruediger Campe, Alexander Duettmann, Werner Hamacher, Vivian Liska, Jean-Luc Nancy, Laurence Rickels, Marianne Schuller, and others.    Resources    Our doctoral students are guaranteed generous funding for four to five years of graduate work. We generally support students for up to two years beyond this. Students are asked to teach for two of their first five years and have opportunities for additional teaching experience within and outside the department.    NYU is a member of the New York Consortium that enables students from NYU, Columbia, Princeton, Rutgers, the New School and CUNY to take courses for credit at another institution.
