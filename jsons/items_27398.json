A Future Theatre Artists Program final project presentation and reception will occur on May 9, 2015. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS: Students must be currently enrolled in High School as a Freshman, Sophomore, or Junior. Students must also be able to provide their own transportation to the free workshop each Saturday. This may suggest residence in one of the five boroughs of New York City, Westchester County, Long Island, New Jersey, Connecticut, or Pennsylvania. Applicants to the program hail from high schools in the five boroughs   of New York City, as well as from Westchester County, Long Island, New   Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. Approximately 12-16 students will   be selected to attend the program. The program focuses its   recruitment efforts on underrepresented groups, particularly students   from lower socio-economic backgrounds. ABOUT THE PROGRAM THIS YEAR: We are honored to host the alumni theatre company, The In-Between People who will serve as the guides for the 2015 program. The In-Between People seek to create a new understanding of the shared human experience through an investigation and exploration of performance, space and community. Topics explored during the program will be relevant issues to the company of emerging young artists. Program sessions will revolve around practical application of theatrical tools (voice, body, presence, and space) and how these tools relate to performance and craft. Theories will be discussed and analyzed through performance, conversation, written reflection, and personal ownership of the creative space. The program will end in a final presentation and performance on May 9, 2015 along with a reception for family and friends of participants. During the 14-week program with The In-Between People you will be exploring the collaborative nature of theatre and its integration into everyday life. Each week, students will focus on a different area of theatre-making, drawing parallels between theatre-making and the practical application of performance technique and artistic practice in everyday life. Students will be asked to explore theatre as a basis for social interaction while producing an ensemble-based live theatrical event to be shared with invited guests at the end of the program. The guiding questions and approach of the 2015 Future Theatre Artists Program guided by The In-Between People are: How do we identify performance space and what is the impact of performance in \u201cnon-traditional\u201d spaces? How do we create memory? How does memory affect us as performers? Where does memory lead us? What it means to be present as performers What defines the space between imagination and reality and how do we play in that space? How can we use these tools we have to affect someone/the audience/the world around us as performers? What leads to understanding? How do we use our art for empathy and change? What does this creative, understanding space look like now?

Please prepare a one-page statement outlining your interest and qualifications for enrolling in this course. Please submit statement to noel.rodriguez@nyu.edu by June 6, 2008.    East Coast Artists\u2019 training has been based on the principle that performers and directors can share a language of the body that not only bonds the group through the creation of ensemble, but also provides specific tools for rehearsal and composition. An important aspect of the work is concerned with the act of performance itself and with deep questions about self, identity and one\u2019s participation in groups. Based on training and performance techniques developed by Richard Schechner, daily practice includes rigorous yoga, breath and vocal exercises, employs text and personal material, as well as movement and sound as points of initiation for composition. Students work closely with East Coast Artists\u2019 accomplished performers and directors to create solo performances and group compositions.    A significant portion of the workshop is dedicated to the RasaBoxes\u2122exercises, devised by Schechner. The exercises comprise a psychophysical approach that begins with finding form for nine basic emotional-energetic archetypes through the use of body and the breath. The work then leads to sound and movement exercises, relating to objects and others, language and text exercises, and finally to scene work and the layering and scoring of rasas to create complex characters, to explore and compose scenes, to create choreography and entire performances. For more information, email: eca@nyu.edu . Paula Murray Cole served as Co-Director of Education for East Coast Artists (ECA), Richard Schechner, Artistic Director, and instructed the ECA Summer Workshop at NYU with colleague Michele Minnick from 1999 to 2005. She was the Program Coordinator and Instructor of ECA\u2019s Summer RasaBoxes Training Intensive at Ithaca College (2005-06) and at the Dell\u2019 Arte International School for Physical Theatre in Blue Lake, CA (2005-07). She has also conducted or co-taught RasaBoxes workshops at Dartmouth, Rutgers and Cornell and has presented the work at conferences at Concordia University in Montreal (2000), Ege University in Izmir, Turkey (2003), the International PSi conference in Singapore (2004), The International Society for Researchers on Emotion Conference (2004), and for the Association for Theatre Movement Educators Colloquium (2005) and the American College Theatre Festival, Region II in Milwaukee, WI (2007).

East Coast Artists\u2019 training has been based on the principle that performers and directors can share a language of the body that not only bonds the group through the creation of ensemble, but also provides specific tools for rehearsal and composition. An important aspect of the work is concerned with the act of performance itself and with deep questions about self, identity and one\u2019s participation in groups. Based on training and performance techniques developed by Richard Schechner, daily practice includes rigorous yoga, breath and vocal exercises, employs text and personal material, as well as movement and sound as points of initiation for composition. Students work closely with East Coast Artists\u2019 accomplished performers and directors to create solo performances and group compositions.    A significant portion of the workshop is dedicated to the RasaBoxes\u2122exercises, devised by Schechner. The exercises comprise a psychophysical approach that begins with finding form for nine basic emotional-energetic archetypes through the use of body and the breath. The work then leads to sound and movement exercises, relating to objects and others, language and text exercises, and finally to scene work and the layering and scoring of rasas to create complex characters, to explore and compose scenes, to create choreography and entire performances.
