PLEASE RSVP ON EVENTBRITE: http://www.eventbrite.com/e/arduino-introduction-workshop-tickets-15437398675   We will have Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino Leonardo boards for people to use. IMPORTANT: Please come with your own laptop and the Arduino software installed on your system: http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#toc2. If you have your own Arduino, please bring it as well, as we may not have enough and people will have to share.   No previous experience required, but basic programming knowledge (such as loops, if statements, variable declaration, and function declaration) would make understanding the C-based Arduino language a lot easier. However if you have no prior coding knowledge, this workshop would be a great intro!   Here&#39;s a bunch of cool things you can make with Arduino!   http://www.instructables.com/tag/type-id/category-technology/channel-arduino/   If you already have experience with Arduino and would like to help others or just talk to other enthusiasts and show them what you&#39;ve made, please come out and join us as well!
