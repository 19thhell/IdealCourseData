The concentration's goals are to prepare health professionals to:     Identify and assess preventable health problems among diverse population groups in the United States and internationally;   Identify the social, cultural, economic, environmental, and institutional factors that contribute to the risk of health problems among diverse populations;   Develop educational and other population-based intervention strategies to improve morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life;   Develop policies to reduce barriers to improved health status;   Apply population-based research findings to the development and implementation of health policies and programs in the United States and in low-income and developing countries; and   Apply principles of ethical reasoning and professional practice to advance health equity and social justice in the United States and in international settings.
