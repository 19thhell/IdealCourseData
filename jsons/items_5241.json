For this work, we use approaches that span systems biology, comparative functional genomics &amp; bioinformatic analysis focusing on model organisms and phylogenetically related species.

Gustavo Silva and Christine Vogel characterize a new mechanism to combat oxidative stress     The study appears in the latest issue of Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, in which the authors discover a new function for a nonstandard (K63) ubiquitin chain: K63 ubiquitin role is independent of protein degradation and conversely, aids the synthesis of antioxidant proteins and increases cell viability.
