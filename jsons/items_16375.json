We are interested in the analysis and representation of visual information, including empirical study of the structure of visual scenes, construction of mathematical theories for representation and processing of that structure, implementation and simulation of biologically plausible instantiations of these theories, and psychophysical or (through collaboration) physiological investigations designed to test these theories.
