Dr. Keefer is a published writer of fiction, a screenwriting  consultant, a licensed massage therapist, a certified personal trainer and aerobics  instructor, and a practicing kinesiologist.     Language and the Body is divided into two activities: the Keefer BRAINBODY   GYMNASIUM and nonverbal/verbal communication techniques and character analysis   in plays, screenplays, legal trials and psychophysical therapeutic exchanges.       The first half of the semester consists of physical and mental exercises using   all senses and modalities (Keefer brainbody gymnasium) to integrate language   and the body, followed by lectures, in-class writing and acting, and discussion   on nonverbal communication in the various disciplines. The midterm exam is a   21/2 hour in-class writing exam in the computer lab on communication/character   and how it relates to your individual project.     The second half of the semester consists of class presentations where you use   language and the body to illustrate the communication/character problems in the   discipline of your choice as well as the development of webfolios to be completed   the last day of class.   Early in the semester each student has a private conference with the professor   to determine the needs, boundaries, and characteristics of her/his project.   Thereafter, you will tailor in-class and weekly assignments, the midterm exam and   especially the class presentation and webfolio to fulfill the criteria of your particular   project.   THE KEEFER BRAINBODY GYMNASIUM consists of mental and physical exercises   to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture (focus, balance etc.) and   coordination (organization, dynamics, versatility, agility, speed etc.) You   should come to class in gym clothes prepared to move, but you will also be writing   and thinking passionately and furiously as all these categories apply to mental   exercises as well. You need not be a superathlete or an aerobics diva to move.   You are exploring your mindbody, not competing on ESPN. Although we will be   acting out, improvising and creating dramatic, therapeutic and legal scenes,   you need not have acting talent. In fact, shyness and embarrassment are fine.   Darwin spent pages discussing \"blushing\" in his book The Expression of Emotions   in Man and Animals!    Language and the Body is great for:    Creative writers who want to ground  their work in a deeper knowledge of language and the body, character and  communication;   Health care professionals who want to define and explore the  therapeutic relationship;   Social Science majors who want to study the nonverbal/verbal communication  in legal trials and write and perform opening and closing statements,  or work on a problem in cross-cultural communication;   Philosophers and Fitness professionals who want to explore the subtle relationships between   mind and body.     Reading Material    There will be weekly reading assignments from the required texts,  handouts of dramatic scenes and case studies, and material from the internet.   You are expected to add at least 5 more reading items of your choice to help you  with your webfolio and class presentation, including a biography for your characte  analysis. The biography can help you create a character in fiction or serve as  a model for investigation in criminology, disease, politics etc.  You pick whatever sources you want for your projects: for example, you can study a particular disease and add medical books and journals;  or compare two trials and add historical and legal books;  or study the body in cyberspace and submit hypertext;  or read books on screenwriting to help you with a dramatic project.    Under Professor Keefer at NYU Bookstore   The Anatomy Coloring Book   BodyMind by Ken Dychtwald  Perfume by Patrick Suskind ( a contemporary  thriller about monsters and the body in eighteenth century France)  The Natural History of the Senses by Diane Ackerman  Nonverbal Communication   The Psychology of Language and Communication (a psycho-sociological textbook synthesizing current theories on verbal and nonverbal communication)  Descartes' Error ( a scientific/philosophical book including the latest research on the brain) by Antonio R. Damasio   In this course we will explore the body itself, drawing on the sciences of anatomy,  kinesiology and physiology; the state of the body when creating language, (using exercises such as relaxation, breath control, ideokinesis, sense memory,  hypnosis, awareness of pain, posture);  the way the body reacts with the environment while  writing (silence, music, noise, pen, pencil, computer, tape recorder);  the ways the body communicates emotions and information without  language (in both dramatic and therapeutic scenes); words in the language that  refer to the body and bodily functions;  the effect of disease, injury, and health on characterisation; and the rhythms  of literature based on the biological experiences of birth, death, orgasms,   eating and eliminating.            Every 3 hour class will include:         Braingymnasium exercises to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture,   coordination and relaxation/stress reduction      Improvisation of fictional and therapeutic scenes using   Keefer's body parts technique      In-class writing about the body, and with body awareness      Readings of students' scenes, essays, monologues, poems and stories      Scientific presentations about the body from the social and   health science majors      Discussion of readings and how they relate to projects      Surfing the net and organization of newsgroups and webfolios.        COURSE REQUIREMENTS   The most important requirements are attendance and participation in the weekly assignments and readings which are graded Excellent, Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory. You cannot get an A if you miss more than one class; if you miss more than 3, you cannot even get a B. You must complete 4 main projects, (which can be related to the same area of interest), for which you will receive letter grades:     The MYfolio: Students prepare a MYfolio to be submitted the last day of class. The MYfolio is for you so it can be as messy, self-indulgent and cathartic as long as you include weekly assignments and in-class writing.  The WEBfolio: This is an html version of your best creative and research writing, graphics, photos, designs or even shockwave to be broadcast eternally in cyberspace for a global audience. The rough draft comes after the midterm; the final project the second to last day of class.  The Midterm Exam: There will be a midterm exam on nonverbal communication based on core lecture material  dealing with the analysis of body posture, gesture, image, facial expression,  musculoskeletal and tissue tonus and adhesions, vocal  resonance, timbre and pitch, effort-shape movement, posturing/ performing/ pretending profiles, vulnerability and the  individual and cultural relationship to time and space.   The Class Presentation: You take over the class for at least 90 minutes with the project of your choice, which should be a combination of physical, mental and multisensory stimuli.

Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees. Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty \u2013 and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.     The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder\u2019s vision, is \u201cin and of the city\u201d: the University \u2013 which has no walls and no gates \u2013 is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.     In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also located in Brooklyn with the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.     And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi \u2013 the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university \u2013 and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.        NYU Mission Statement   Great cities are engines of creativity, and New York University takes its name and spirit from one of the busiest, most diverse and dynamic cities of all. The University lives within New York and other great cities, from Abu Dhabi to Shanghai, Paris to Prague, Sydney to Buenos Aires\u2014all magnets for talented, ambitious people.   Thriving beyond borders and across academic disciplines, NYU has emerged as one of the most networked and extensive worldwide platform for learning, teaching, researching, building knowledge, and inventing new ways to meet humanity\u2019s challenges. Its students, faculty and alumni feed off the stimulating power of swirling intellectual and cultural experiences by mastering academic disciplines, expressing themselves in the arts, and excelling in demanding professions.   New York University\u2019s mission is to be a top quality international center of scholarship, teaching and research. This involves retaining and attracting outstanding faculty who are leaders in their fields, encouraging them to create programs that draw outstanding students, and providing an intellectually rich environment. NYU seeks to take academic and cultural advantage of its location and to embrace diversity among faculty, staff and students to ensure a wide range of perspectives, including international perspectives, in the educational experience.                                          Message From the President Under President Sexton's administration, the University has moved forward from being an institution that is \"in and of the city,\" to being one that is in and of the world.

Keefer--Fall1996, Spring 1997, Fall 1997              N.B. For those seeking to obtain life experience credit for this course,    the requirements are simple: Students submit a CREATIVE portfolio or webfolio    showing the unique ways they have brought language and the body together.    They can approach it from any discipline. In the past, a U.S. Marshall submitted    his personal journal including narratives of the verbal and nonverbal behavior    of felons, as well as a lecture/dem on verbal judo; a poet/yoga teacher    submitted a webfolio uniting her original poems with drawings of various    yoga postures; an au pair woman studying psychology did a nonverbal/verbal    case study of her manic depressive charge and devised an innovative system    of play therapy to help him; an actress documented her use of sound, movement    and nonverbal communication in the creation of specific characters; a businessman    studied the nonverbal communication of the Chinese in international business    deals during his trip to China. Search this web site for ideas as well as    the links to student projects in all disciplines.                   (A multi-disciplinary course for creative writing and social/health science majors. Dr. Keefer is a published writer of fiction, a screenwriting  consultant, a licensed massage therapist, a certified personal trainer and aerobics  instructor, and a practicing kinesiologist.     Language and the Body is divided into two activities: the Keefer BRAINBODY   GYMNASIUM and nonverbal/verbal communication techniques and character analysis   in plays, screenplays, legal trials and psychophysical therapeutic exchanges.       The first half of the semester consists of physical and mental exercises using   all senses and modalities (Keefer brainbody gymnasium) to integrate language   and the body, followed by lectures, in-class writing and acting, and discussion   on nonverbal communication in the various disciplines. The midterm exam is a   21/2 hour in-class writing exam in the computer lab on communication/character   and how it relates to your individual project.     The second half of the semester consists of class presentations where you use   language and the body to illustrate the communication/character problems in the   discipline of your choice as well as the development of webfolios to be completed   the last day of class.   Early in the semester each student has a private conference with the professor   to determine the needs, boundaries, and characteristics of her/his project.   Thereafter, you will tailor in-class and weekly assignments, the midterm exam and   especially the class presentation and webfolio to fulfill the criteria of your particular   project.   THE KEEFER BRAINBODY GYMNASIUM consists of mental and physical exercises   to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture (focus, balance etc.) and   coordination (organization, dynamics, versatility, agility, speed etc.) You   should come to class in gym clothes prepared to move, but you will also be writing   and thinking passionately and furiously as all these categories apply to mental   exercises as well. You need not be a superathlete or an aerobics diva to move.   You are exploring your mindbody, not competing on ESPN. Although we will be   acting out, improvising and creating dramatic, therapeutic and legal scenes,   you need not have acting talent. In fact, shyness and embarrassment are fine.   Darwin spent pages discussing \"blushing\" in his book The Expression of Emotions   in Man and Animals!    Language and the Body is great for:    Creative writers who want to ground  their work in a deeper knowledge of language and the body, character and  communication;   Health care professionals who want to define and explore the  therapeutic relationship;   Social Science majors who want to study the nonverbal/verbal communication  in legal trials and write and perform opening and closing statements,  or work on a problem in cross-cultural communication;   Philosophers and Fitness professionals who want to explore the subtle relationships between   mind and body.     Reading Material    There will be weekly reading assignments from the required texts,  handouts of dramatic scenes and case studies, and material from the internet.   You are expected to add at least 5 more reading items of your choice to help you  with your webfolio and class presentation, including a biography for your characte  analysis. The biography can help you create a character in fiction or serve as  a model for investigation in criminology, disease, politics etc.  You pick whatever sources you want for your projects: for example, you can study a particular disease and add medical books and journals;  or compare two trials and add historical and legal books;  or study the body in cyberspace and submit hypertext;  or read books on screenwriting to help you with a dramatic project.    Under Professor Keefer at NYU Bookstore   The Anatomy Coloring Book   BodyMind by Ken Dychtwald  Perfume by Patrick Suskind ( a contemporary  thriller about monsters and the body in eighteenth century France)  The Natural History of the Senses by Diane Ackerman  Nonverbal Communication   The Psychology of Language and Communication (a psycho-sociological textbook synthesizing current theories on verbal and nonverbal communication)  Descartes' Error ( a scientific/philosophical book including the latest research on the brain) by Antonio R. Damasio   In this course we will explore the body itself, drawing on the sciences of anatomy,  kinesiology and physiology; the state of the body when creating language, (using exercises such as relaxation, breath control, ideokinesis, sense memory,  hypnosis, awareness of pain, posture);  the way the body reacts with the environment while  writing (silence, music, noise, pen, pencil, computer, tape recorder);  the ways the body communicates emotions and information without  language (in both dramatic and therapeutic scenes); words in the language that  refer to the body and bodily functions;  the effect of disease, injury, and health on characterisation; and the rhythms  of literature based on the biological experiences of birth, death, orgasms,   eating and eliminating.            Every 3 hour class will include:         Braingymnasium exercises to develop strength, flexibility, endurance, posture,   coordination and relaxation/stress reduction      Improvisation of fictional and therapeutic scenes using   Keefer's body parts technique      In-class writing about the body, and with body awareness      Readings of students' scenes, essays, monologues, poems and stories      Scientific presentations about the body from the social and   health science majors      Discussion of readings and how they relate to projects      Surfing the net and organization of newsgroups and webfolios.        COURSE REQUIREMENTS   The most important requirements are attendance and participation in the weekly assignments and readings which are graded Excellent, Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory. You cannot get an A if you miss more than one class; if you miss more than 3, you cannot even get a B. You must complete 4 main projects, (which can be related to the same area of interest), for which you will receive letter grades:     The MYfolio: Students prepare a MYfolio to be submitted the last day of class. The MYfolio is for you so it can be as messy, self-indulgent and cathartic as long as you include weekly assignments and in-class writing.  The WEBfolio: This is an html version of your best creative and research writing, graphics, photos, designs or even shockwave to be broadcast eternally in cyberspace for a global audience. The rough draft comes after the midterm; the final project the second to last day of class.  The Midterm Exam: There will be a midterm exam on nonverbal communication based on core lecture material  dealing with the analysis of body posture, gesture, image, facial expression,  musculoskeletal and tissue tonus and adhesions, vocal  resonance, timbre and pitch, effort-shape movement, posturing/ performing/ pretending profiles, vulnerability and the  individual and cultural relationship to time and space.   The Class Presentation: You take over the class for at least 90 minutes with the project of your choice, which should be a combination of physical, mental and multisensory stimuli.
