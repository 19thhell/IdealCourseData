Solomon     Syllabus: Download PDF     Description     Although the First Amendment appears on its  face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on the press, the U.S. Supreme  Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests  of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious  libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won  in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in  1964. Students will examine freedom of the press through the prism of a rich  variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel, newsgathering problems,  the right of privacy, prior restraint, and the conflict between free press  and fair trial. Readings include a The First Amendment and  the Fourth Estate; Make No  Law by Anthony Lewis, The  Unwanted Gaze by Jeffrey Rosen, and Origins of the Bill of Rights by Leonard  Levy. Students write five papers during the semester.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

Solomon     Syllabus: Download PDF     Description     Although the First Amendment appears on its  face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on the press, the U.S. Supreme  Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests  of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious  libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won  in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in  1964. Students will examine freedom of the press through the prism of a rich  variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel, newsgathering problems,  the right of privacy, prior restraint, and the conflict between free press  and fair trial. Readings include a The First Amendment and  the Fourth Estate; Make No  Law by Anthony Lewis, The  Unwanted Gaze by Jeffrey Rosen, and Origins of the Bill of Rights by Leonard  Levy. Students write five papers during the semester.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

First Amendment rights and legal and ethical responsibilities and limitations will be examined and discussed. The course will look at these questions from five viewpoints: from (i) the practical view of a journalist doing his job with (ii) heavy consideration of ethical imperatives, and (iii) from a legal prospective, all the while (iv) considering the rules in a public policy context -- are they fair and appropriate in our society? -- while (v) noting the historical context in which they arise. Significant court cases and fundamental legal rules as well as past ethical scandals and issues will be explored in the context of political and historical realities, and in terms of journalistic standards and practices; contemporary media law issues and ethical problems and guidelines will also be focused on. Among the basic First Amendment issues which will be examined are libel, invasion of privacy, prior restraints, newsgathering and newsgathering torts, and the reporter's privilege; some of the ethical issues to be explored include objectivity in reporting, bias and transparency, conflicts of interest, and fair dealings with subjects, sources and advertisers.

Solomon     Syllabus: Download PDF     Description     Although the First Amendment appears on its  face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on the press, the U.S. Supreme  Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests  of society. This course begins by examining the struggle against seditious  libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won  in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in  1964. Students will examine freedom of the press through the prism of a rich  variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel, newsgathering problems,  the right of privacy, prior restraint, and the conflict between free press  and fair trial. Readings include a The First Amendment and  the Fourth Estate; Make No  Law by Anthony Lewis, The  Unwanted Gaze by Jeffrey Rosen, and Origins of the Bill of Rights by Leonard  Levy. Students write five papers during the semester.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

First Amendment rights and legal and ethical responsibilities and limitations will be examined and discussed. The course will look at these questions from five viewpoints: from (i) the practical view of a journalist doing his job with (ii) heavy consideration of ethical imperatives, and (iii) from a legal prospective, all the while (iv) considering the rules in a public policy context -- are they fair and appropriate in our society? -- while (v) noting the historical context in which they arise. Significant court cases and fundamental legal rules as well as past ethical scandals and issues will be explored in the context of political and historical realities, and in terms of journalistic standards and practices; contemporary media law issues and ethical problems and guidelines will also be focused on. Among the basic First Amendment issues which will be examined are libel, invasion of privacy, prior restraints, newsgathering and newsgathering torts, and the reporter's privilege; some of the ethical issues to be explored include objectivity in reporting, bias and transparency, conflicts of interest, and fair dealings with subjects, sources and advertisers.

Unlike other professionals, journalists must make their ethical decisions rapidly, often without clear guidelines, and on their own, and the results of their decisions are open to public view. Also unlike other professionals, violations of ethical precepts are not punished by professional discipline or revocation of a license. This makes it vital that journalists weigh the value of how and what they choose to report against the potential harm to subjects, sources and society as a whole. The objective of this course is to provide guidance, through consideration of hypothetical and actual situations and analysis of case decisions, in developing a framework to help you make ethical and legal professional choices and to suggest some criteria against which those decisions may be measured.
