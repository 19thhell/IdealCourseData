The emphasis will be on understanding general concepts that  are applicable to a wide range of operating systems, rather than a discussion of the features  of any one specific system. Topics that will be covered include:      OS histories, i.e. types of operating systems and what which one stuck,   protected kernels,   processes and threads,   concurrency and synchronization, deadlocks and preventions,   memory management, virtual memory and computer architecture facilitating it (pagetables, segmentation),   file systems,   secondary storage.      Examples will be from Unix/Linux.  Programming assignments will be based on C or C++ as Operatings Systems are implemented that way.    This course does not assume that you have taken an Operating Systems course as an undergraduate,  or that you have had extensive experience working with one. In fact, if you have taken such a  course or have a fair amount of practical experience with OS internals, this course is probably  too elementary for you. Please take a look at the course schedule to get a sense of the topics  that will be covered: if you can explain most of the terms contained there, you are likely looking  for a more advanced course. We will NOT be \"hacking\" on an operating system but will have  lab assignments that deal with the fundamental elements such as different process schedulers and memory management algorithms.

If you do not have one already, please get it asap.  Sign up for the Mailman mailing list for the course once it is setup.   You can do so by clicking mailing_list   If you want to send mail just to me, use my-last-name AT nyu DOT edu not  the mailing list.  Questions on the labs should go to the mailing list.  You may answer questions posed on the list as well.  Note that replies are sent to the list .  I will respond to all questions; if another student has answered the  question before I get to it, I will confirm if the answer given is  correct.     Several labs (programming assignments) across the semester will provide practical implementations of operating system concepts such as processor scheduling and memory management. These assignments are accepted in C or C++.   homeworks and Labs   I make a distinction between homeworks and labs. Both are required  and form part of your grade.   Labs (aka programming assignments) are     Due several lectures later (date given on assignment).   Graded and form part of your final grade.   Penalized for lateness.   The penalty is 2 points per day. Start your lab early and finish on time !!!   Computer programs YOU must write.    Homeworks are optional, they are there to help get through the material     Mostly from the book.   Please send softcopy to your TA marked as OS-Spring14 Homework   Graded and returned via softmail       Doing Labs on non-NYU Systems   You may solve lab assignments on any system you wish, but ...     You are responsible for any non-nyu machine.   I extend deadlines if the nyu machines are down, not if yours are.   Be sure to test your assignments on the nyu   systems.   In an ideal world, a program written in a high level language like   Java, C, or C++ that works on your system would also work on the   NYU system used by the grader.   Sadly, this ideal is not always achieved despite marketing claims   that it is achieved.   So, although you may develop your lab on any system, you   must ensure that it runs on the nyu system assigned to   the course.   If somehow your assignment is misplaced by me and/or a grader,   we need a to have some timestamp ON AN NYU SYSTEM     that can be used to verify the date the lab was completed.   So once the lab is completed and safely located on an NYU   system, do not touch it since that will change   the time stamps on the file. Best is   When you complete a lab and have it on an nyu system, email the   lab to the grader and copy yourself on that message.   Please use one of the following two methods of mailing the lab.       Send the mail from your CIMS account .    (Not all students have a CIMS account.)    Use the request receipt feature from home.nyu.edu    or mail.nyu.edu and select the when delivered option.       Keep the copy until you have received your grade on the   assignment.   I realize that I am being paranoid about this.   It is rare for labs to get misplaced, but they sometimes do and I   really don't want to be in the middle of an   I sent it ... I never received it debate.   Thank you.     Obtaining Help with the Labs   Good methods for obtaining help include     Asking me during office hours (see web page for my hours).   Asking the mailing list.   Asking another student, but ...    Your lab must be your own .    That is, each student must submit a unique lab.   Naturally, simply changing comments, variable names, etc. does   not produce a unique lab.
