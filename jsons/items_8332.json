Cell Signaling and Environmental Stress EHSC-GA 2043 (G48.2043)  Prerequisite: undergraduate biology or biochemistry. X. Huang, C. Huang. 4 points.  In the last few years, we have gained extensive knowledge of how cell surface receptors transmit signals to the nucleus, thereby controlling the expression of genetic programs involved in many cellular processes, including normal and aberrant cell growth. Signaling motifs (e.g., nuclear transcription receptors, kinase/phosphatase cascades, G-coupled protein receptors, etc.) are components of signaling webs, which are targets of disruption by environmental pollutants. This course covers various signal transduction pathways such as cytokine signaling and signal transduction to the nucleus by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Some of the known detailed mechanisms, such as regulation of MAPK by phosphatases (removal of phosphorylation) and dual phosphorylation of MAPK on the relevant threonine and tyrosine leading to the downstream activator protein-1 (AP-1) activation, are discussed. The course further illustrates that alteration of the pathways by environmental pollutants, such as transition metals and airborne particles, may be implicated in pathological processes, cancer, inflammation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. Students gain a basic understanding of principles emerging in the signaling field and how they serve as guiding tools for students engaged in basic, clinical, and translational medical research.

Research Activities   The faculty, post-doctoral trainees, and graduate students in this program area are addressing critical issues in the environmental health sciences. In recent research, they have made advances in exposure assessment including improved characterization of fine particles and their spatial variation within urban areas and in the regional northeastern U.S. background aerosol. They have also developed technologies and procedures to characterize the temporal day-to-day variations in ambient aerosol composition over extended periods of time in order to correlate such changes with observed daily variations in health-related cardiopulmonary responses. In terms of the characterization of health effects of particulate matter air pollution in human populations, this research group has extended its capabilities beyond studies that rely on non-specific mass concentrations of PM10\u00a0and/or PM2.5\u00a0to associations between mortality and morbidity and specific source-related pollution constituents and components for both acute and cumulative health effects. They have applied these approaches to populations of particular concern, including asthmatic children in the South Bronx region of New York City (NYC) and to residents of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn who were acutely exposed to dust and smoke following the collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on September 11, 2001. This involved utilization of air samples that we collected at the former NYU Downtown Hospital (5 blocks east of the WTC) on a daily basis beginning on September 14, 2001. Recent studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of components of PM2.5\u00a0vary greatly within NYC, with much higher concentrations of nickel in Bronx, Manhattan and northern Queens than in Brooklyn, Staten Island and southern Queens due to the combustion of much more residual oil in the northern parts of NYC.   Other notable strengths of the Program faculty include respiratory tract dosimetry and the modeling and analysis of temporal and spatial variations of air pollution exposure and other environmental variables that can influence, or confound, associations between measures of ambient air pollution and population based data on mortality and morbidity.   In summary, the mission of this Research Program is to identify the exposure related factors that play significant roles in the causation and/or exacerbation of disease associated with population exposures to air pollutants in community and/or work place settings. It also provides a forum and focus for innovative and multidisciplinary research directed at resolving the complex issues affecting both the exposure and response sides of the risk assessment paradigm. The opportunities for broadening the background knowledge and perspectives of the Program members are significantly enhanced by having frequent joint meetings with the members of the Systemic Toxicology Program of the Department, where opportunities are available to discuss hypotheses addressable by controlled inhalation exposures to concentrated ambient aerosols and/or realistic artificial atmospheres of suspect pollutant chemicals and mixtures.   Specific program goals for the next five years are to:   Pursue studies that determine the role of the components of ambient air PM that may account for the ability of such relatively low particle mass concentrations to elicit significant impacts on mortality and morbidity in the general population.   In collaboration with the Systemic Toxicology Program, to identify the specific ambient air constituents that correlate most closely with both the transient and persistent cardiac effects by subchronic exposures to particular matter.   Extend ongoing studies in New York City in order to determine the extent of the role that ambient air pollution (and especially traffic-related air pollution) plays in the high prevalence of pediatric asthma and its exacerbation.   Core Leadership   Dr. George D. Thurston , the Program Director for Human Exposure and Health Effects, received an Sc.D.\u00a0in environmental health science from Harvard University's School of Public Health, and did further research on mortality associated with air pollution at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government before joining NYU in 1988. His research on air pollution and its health effects at NYU has focused on ozone and particulate matter through studies on panels of children in summer camps, in schools in the South Bronx, and adults with pre-existing chronic diseases, as well as on time-series analyses of hospital admissions and excess daily mortality, and on the influence of chronic exposures on longevity in numerous U.S. communities. He has numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications, and has chaired, or been a member of numerous scientific committees for the National Research Council, NIEHS, and EPA. He recently served on the Outdoor Air Polution Working Group for the WHO Global Burden of Disease 2010 Report release in December 2012. Professor Thurston is presently a standing member of the NIH Study Section on Cardiovascular and Sleep Epidemiology (CASE).

Research Activities   The faculty, post-doctoral trainees, and graduate students in this program area are addressing critical issues in the environmental health sciences. In recent research, they have made advances in exposure assessment including improved characterization of fine particles and their spatial variation within urban areas and in the regional northeastern U.S. background aerosol. They have also developed technologies and procedures to characterize the temporal day-to-day variations in ambient aerosol composition over extended periods of time in order to correlate such changes with observed daily variations in health-related cardiopulmonary responses. In terms of the characterization of health effects of particulate matter air pollution in human populations, this research group has extended its capabilities beyond studies that rely on non-specific mass concentrations of PM10\u00a0and/or PM2.5\u00a0to associations between mortality and morbidity and specific source-related pollution constituents and components for both acute and cumulative health effects. They have applied these approaches to populations of particular concern, including asthmatic children in the South Bronx region of New York City (NYC) and to residents of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn who were acutely exposed to dust and smoke following the collapse of the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings on September 11, 2001. This involved utilization of air samples that we collected at the former NYU Downtown Hospital (5 blocks east of the WTC) on a daily basis beginning on September 14, 2001. Recent studies have demonstrated that the concentrations of components of PM2.5\u00a0vary greatly within NYC, with much higher concentrations of nickel in Bronx, Manhattan and northern Queens than in Brooklyn, Staten Island and southern Queens due to the combustion of much more residual oil in the northern parts of NYC.   Other notable strengths of the Program faculty include respiratory tract dosimetry and the modeling and analysis of temporal and spatial variations of air pollution exposure and other environmental variables that can influence, or confound, associations between measures of ambient air pollution and population based data on mortality and morbidity.   In summary, the mission of this Research Program is to identify the exposure related factors that play significant roles in the causation and/or exacerbation of disease associated with population exposures to air pollutants in community and/or work place settings. It also provides a forum and focus for innovative and multidisciplinary research directed at resolving the complex issues affecting both the exposure and response sides of the risk assessment paradigm. The opportunities for broadening the background knowledge and perspectives of the Program members are significantly enhanced by having frequent joint meetings with the members of the Systemic Toxicology Program of the Department, where opportunities are available to discuss hypotheses addressable by controlled inhalation exposures to concentrated ambient aerosols and/or realistic artificial atmospheres of suspect pollutant chemicals and mixtures.   Specific program goals for the next five years are to:   Pursue studies that determine the role of the components of ambient air PM that may account for the ability of such relatively low particle mass concentrations to elicit significant impacts on mortality and morbidity in the general population.   In collaboration with the Systemic Toxicology Program, to identify the specific ambient air constituents that correlate most closely with both the transient and persistent cardiac effects by subchronic exposures to particular matter.   Extend ongoing studies in New York City in order to determine the extent of the role that ambient air pollution (and especially traffic-related air pollution) plays in the high prevalence of pediatric asthma and its exacerbation.   Core Leadership   Dr. George D. Thurston , the Program Director for Human Exposure and Health Effects, received an Sc.D.\u00a0in environmental health science from Harvard University's School of Public Health, and did further research on mortality associated with air pollution at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government before joining NYU in 1988. His research on air pollution and its health effects at NYU has focused on ozone and particulate matter through studies on panels of children in summer camps, in schools in the South Bronx, and adults with pre-existing chronic diseases, as well as on time-series analyses of hospital admissions and excess daily mortality, and on the influence of chronic exposures on longevity in numerous U.S. communities. He has numerous peer-reviewed scientific publications, and has chaired, or been a member of numerous scientific committees for the National Research Council, NIEHS, and EPA.

Overview   The Integrative Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) was initially organized in November, 2007 and is now composed of four sub service cores and one well-developed international partnership. The overall mission of our IHFSC is to promote the use of human samples by bench researchers. The NYU Center has a plethora of outstanding basic science research, and our vision, with the active participation of the IHSFC, is to translate our basic research results into human health studies. Since its inception about three years ago, the IHSFC has been very active in implementing this new vision for the Center, expanding on the knowledge gained from prior research using cell culture or animal models. Another goal of this facility core is to promote interactions and productive collaborations between Center investigators with research focusing on mechanistic studies of environmental health hazards and Center members involved in clinical and population-based epidemiologic studies. To achieve this goal, the IHSFC has been providing and will continue to offer comprehensive services to all Center investigators who are planning to conduct translational research through its 4 sub facility cores and the international partner, including: 1) environmental epidemiology services; 2) ethical issues and QC/QA support; 3) exposure sampling and assessment; 4) clinical facility for research of environmental hazards; and 5) Lanzhou University School of Public Health (See Figure below).   \u00a0   2. Services Provided According to the Sub-Facility Cores   Environmental Epidemiology Services  The leadership of this sub-core has substantial experience in observational epidemiologic studies with a focus on environmental exposure. Services provided include the following:   Consultation for appropriate study design (case-control, case-cohort, cohort, or cross-sectional) and related methodology issues.   Assistance on epidemiology questionnaire design for new studies that will capture key confounding factors, risk factors for disease of interest, and exposure information.   Referrals to the Environmental Health Statistics and Bioinformatics core for statistics and bioinformatics, which would include management of high throughput data such as genomics, ChIP-seq, etc.   Identification of appropriate and existing study populations.   Referrals to appropriate epidemiologists as potential collaborators with basic scientists to promote interdisciplinary projects and translational studies.   Consultation on the methods and pilot studies to evaluate reproducibility and validity of the exposure and effect measures including biomarkers of disease and environmental exposures.   Ethical Issues and QC/QA Support  The leadership and personnel of this sub facility core have extensive experience in human population research, and therefore, will be able to assist Center investigators directly or to make referrals to other Center members for assistance and collaborations. The following specific services are provided:   Assistance in the preparation of Human Subject Protocols, Consent Forms, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) applications.   Consultation for QA and QC procedures in biomarker measurements and human population studies.\u00a0   Consultation for methods related to sample collection, processing, storage, and labeling.\u00a0   Assistance in maintenance of archived biological samples in the Center and with active searches to identify existing well-characterized populations for Center members.   Exposure Sampling and Assessment  In order to provide services outlined below, this sub core of the IHSFC is structured with expertise in environmental exposure monitoring and equipped with both ambient and personal exposure sampling devices and analytical instrument. The leadership of this sub core has expertise to effectively support Center investigators' research activities in relation to:   Ambient and personal exposure sampling and monitoring   Analysis for pollutants of interest in the collected samplers\u00a0   Clinical Facility for Environmental Research  The leadership and personnel related to this sub-core will provide the following services to the Center investigators:\u00a0   Consultation for studies that aim to identify and validate biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer.   Consultation for studies that investigate the interaction between genetic susceptibility and smoking and asbestos exposure in lung cancer risk or biomarkers for lung cancer.   Assistance to identify a clinical epidemiologist or a physician that can work with a basic scientist in recruiting new participants or using existing samples collected at the NYU Lung Cancer Biomarker Center.   Clinical services to the Center investigators whose research projects require special clinical examination or laboratory tests related to lung diseases for his/her study subjects.   3. Existing Biological Samples that can be used for New Collaborations\u00a0     4. Operational Policies   In general, the resources and services of the Facility Core will be made available to all faculty and staff in the Department and other schools, however, Center members are given priority over non-members. Furthermore, among all potential research projects, the Center Pilot Projects planning to collect human preliminary data for grant applications are given a special priority for consideration.\u00a0  Request for using existing biospecimens to develop preliminary results needs to be first approved by and collaborated with the original source PIs. The director and Co-directors of the Core will be responsible for assuring that all initiated collaborations comply with all applicable federal regulations and IRB policies.
