Global Content at Global Sites, in One Year   The Global EMPA program is a one-year, full-time program. Students spend the first semester (August - December) at NYU Wagner in New York City and the spring semester (January - May) at UCL in London.\u00a0 Students spend the summer (June - August) in locations across the globe working on a client-based Capstone project.   A Call for Experienced Leaders   The Global EMPA is intended for experienced leaders \u2013 analysts, decision makers, and managers \u2013 in domestic and international organizations, and in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors. The program equips public service leaders with the knowledge and skills they need to design and implement effective and sustainable solutions to unprecedented global challenges.   A Fulbright award is available to British and US citizens.   \u00a0   Addressing Challenges at the Intersections   Whatever their chosen field, today's global leaders need to be able to develop and implement creative, cross-sector policies in a complex environment in which many communities and organizations have a stake. They may also find themselves moving across a variety of public, nonprofit and private sector institutions in different locations during their careers.   During their year in the Global EMPA, students improve their ability to craft effective solutions to problems in the face of global and local policy and management challenges. They learn to balance advantages of public and private sector actors; promote successful inter-governmental cooperation at all levels; more effectively link policy analysis with policy implementation; and broadly ensure that policy is meeting its intended objectives and improving human welfare.

Global Content at Global Sites, in One Year   The Global EMPA program is a one-year, full-time program. Students spend the first semester (August - December) at NYU Wagner in New York City and the spring semester (January - May) at UCL in London.\u00a0 Students spend the summer (June - August) in locations across the globe working on a client-based Capstone project.   A Call for Experienced Leaders   The Global EMPA is intended for experienced leaders \u2013 analysts, decision makers, and managers \u2013 in domestic and international organizations, and in the public, nonprofit, and private sectors. The program equips public service leaders with the knowledge and skills they need to design and implement effective and sustainable solutions to unprecedented global challenges.   A Fulbright award is available to British and US citizens.   \u00a0   Addressing Challenges at the Intersections   Whatever their chosen field, today's global leaders need to be able to develop and implement creative, cross-sector policies in a complex environment in which many communities and organizations have a stake. They may also find themselves moving across a variety of public, nonprofit and private sector institutions in different locations during their careers.   During their year in the Global EMPA, students improve their ability to craft effective solutions to problems in the face of global and local policy and management challenges. They learn to balance advantages of public and private sector actors; promote successful inter-governmental cooperation at all levels; more effectively link policy analysis with policy implementation; and broadly ensure that policy is meeting its intended objectives and improving human welfare.
