The degree requirements for a BFA in Drama include a minimum of three years of professional training, but many choose to continue beyond that. Professional training is deeply intertwined with a substantial academic curriculum throughout your entire career here at NYU. There are two phases of professional training in the Drama department: a primary training phase and an advanced training phase. The primary training phase occurs in your first two years and gives students a strong foundation in the skills needed to proceed onto an advanced level of training. Upon acceptance into the department, students are placed into one of seven different primary training studios where they begin intensive conservatory training towards a strong foundation in technique. Students remain in their primary training studio for four consecutive semesters to complete a progressive curriculum. Each semester builds upon the last. The advanced training phase begins once primary training is completed. Students may take advantage of a variety of additional professional training options, which include advanced training at their own or other primary studios, more specialized training, study abroad and internships.

The degree requirements for a BFA in Drama include a minimum of three years of professional training, but many choose to continue beyond that. Professional training is deeply intertwined with a substantial academic curriculum throughout your entire career here at NYU. There are two phases of professional training in the Drama department: a primary training phase and an advanced training phase. The primary training phase occurs in your first two years and gives students a strong foundation in the skills needed to proceed onto an advanced level of training. Upon acceptance into the department, students are placed into one of seven different primary training studios where they begin intensive conservatory training towards a strong foundation in technique. Students remain in their primary training studio for four consecutive semesters to complete a progressive curriculum. Each semester builds upon the last. The advanced training phase begins once primary training is completed. Students may take advantage of a variety of additional professional training options, which include advanced training at their own or other primary studios, more specialized training, study abroad and internships.
