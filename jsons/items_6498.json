First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.

Description       From Velazquez\u2019s enigmatic Spanish Baroque painting \u201cLas Meninas,\u201d which depicts the artist himself in the presence of the royal family, to the current moment when the digital \u201cselfie\u201d functions as a gauge of cultural narcissism, this writing-intensive class will examine \u201cthe portrait\u201d and its prominent and peculiar place as a visual and textual object in pre-modern and modern global contexts through written description, formal analysis and contextualization. The practice of portraiture indicates the ways that a society classifies human beings, establishes hierarchies and reveals its value systems. Beyond portraiture as an art form, we will explore it as a vernacular and/or ritual practice as well as a treatment of identity and personhood in diverse time periods and geographical locations. We will devote attention to Vietnamese altar portraits used for ancestor worship as well as the iconic images and representational politics of pictures of Hitler, Che Guevara and Chairman Mao. We will consider the influences that different and transforming media technologies have on representing people and the self. Through an analysis of Italo Calvino\u2019s essay about Mussolini\u2019s official portrait, we will consider the relationship between text and image and apply some of his innovative literary techniques to class writing assignments. In two five-page essays and three drafts of a 10-12 page final essay, students will develop their academic writing and rhetorical skills through an engagement with visual and textual material. Beyond Calvino, readings may include essays by George Simmel, Mette Siggstedt, Geoffrey Batchen, Oscar Wilde, James Elkins, Joanne Woodall, Claudia Schmolders, Roland Barthes and Maurizio Peleggi.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Description       From Velazquez\u2019s enigmatic Spanish Baroque painting \u201cLas Meninas,\u201d which depicts the artist himself in the presence of the royal family, to the current moment when the digital \u201cselfie\u201d functions as a gauge of cultural narcissism, this writing-intensive class will examine \u201cthe portrait\u201d and its prominent and peculiar place as a visual and textual object in pre-modern and modern global contexts through written description, formal analysis and contextualization. The practice of portraiture indicates the ways that a society classifies human beings, establishes hierarchies and reveals its value systems. Beyond portraiture as an art form, we will explore it as a vernacular and/or ritual practice as well as a treatment of identity and personhood in diverse time periods and geographical locations. We will devote attention to Vietnamese altar portraits used for ancestor worship as well as the iconic images and representational politics of pictures of Hitler, Che Guevara and Chairman Mao. We will consider the influences that different and transforming media technologies have on representing people and the self. Through an analysis of Italo Calvino\u2019s essay about Mussolini\u2019s official portrait, we will consider the relationship between text and image and apply some of his innovative literary techniques to class writing assignments. In two five-page essays and three drafts of a 10-12 page final essay, students will develop their academic writing and rhetorical skills through an engagement with visual and textual material. Beyond Calvino, readings may include essays by George Simmel, Mette Siggstedt, Geoffrey Batchen, Oscar Wilde, James Elkins, Joanne Woodall, Claudia Schmolders, Roland Barthes and Maurizio Peleggi.
