Our mission  is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global  citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for  student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly  communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced  Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished  faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we  think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the  intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They  challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and  beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual  responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world.      In spring 2005, the College of Arts and  Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends  the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to  upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and, if space  allows, seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the  College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and  from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental  leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars  are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes  toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count  only as electives.      Advanced Honors Seminars have three  central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between  exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students  intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking,  writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in  and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant  or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly  insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of  students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year!        G. Gabrielle Starr Acting Dean of the College        Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs          Course  Descriptions Winter 2012 The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Case  Study in Literary Research AHSEM-UA 126 Instructor: Marvin Taylor Monday through Friday, 12:30-3:20 p.m. Winter Session runs January 3-21, 2012      Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel, The  Picture of Dorian Gray , is a cultural lightning rod. When it was  first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the  newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as \u201cmorbid\u201d  and \u201cunhealthy\u201d\u2014coded language that suggested homosexuality to  the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication  history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the  U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel  provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in  its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the  novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s  correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text.  Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s  London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere  Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement  philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d  late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian  ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do  in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these  topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The  goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how  vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 001.      Marvin Taylor is Director of the Fales  Library and Special Collections at NYU. He holds degrees from Indiana  University in Comparative Literature and Library Science, and in  English Literature from NYU.

Taylor has taught literary methodology, queer theory,  Victorian literature, and contemporary art history all from the  perspective of primary research in archives. His research about, and  interest in, Oscar Wilde led to his inclusion in the dramatis  personae of Moises Kaufman\u2019s play, Gross Indecency: The Three  Trials of Oscar Wilde.          Spring 2012            A History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will take up an extended  history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of  religion). It will begin with references to anthropology, the Hebrews  and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of  disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then will follow the uneven  progress of this idea and its consequences in Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the  19th century, when disbelief was allied with radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course  will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the  most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief.  Readings may include selections from the Bible, as well as work by  Cicero, Hume, Mill, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Derrida, among  others.      Mitchell Stephens is Professor of  Journalism. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of  the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His  articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and  other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , Washington  Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. He is  currently writing books on the future of journalism and on the  history of disbelief.            \u201c Varieties of Religious  Experience\u201d Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will utilize but also  update William James\u2019s pioneering approach to interpreting and  understanding religion in psychological rather than theological  terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing  than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of  utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of  cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon  of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism,  apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort  modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the  vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral,  legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost  their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the  political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and  contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding and experience that are  consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being  reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this  is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both  culture and personality will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the  population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the  pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two  centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced  with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time  of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march  forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular  languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence  for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest  periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of  the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and  Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who  transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who  informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many  historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible  of all the centuries before the 21st. Cross-listed with History as  HIST-UA 105.

The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.      Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.

Edmund Wilson and the Art of  Cultural Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Instructor: Paul Berman Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic , the New  Yorker , the New York Review of Books and other magazines.  Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a  series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of  Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary  modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War;  and various traditions of American thought and literature over the  centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of  journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational  ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply  Wilson\u2019s principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an  extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a  better writer.

Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Instructor: Michael Nash Monday, 2:00-4:45 p.m.      Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and  read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students  will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly  basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources,  interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research  questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664.

Political Cinema and Representation  of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is  viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be  eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternately,  reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus  primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most  conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also  explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United  States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will  explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically  and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in  filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history,  especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and  violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.

Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014 novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s  \u201cWhat is Literature.\u201d Cross-listed with Comparative Literature  as COLIT-UA 181.

He earned an OBIE award for achievement in  Off-Broadway Theatre.            Mimesis and Mimicry AHSEM-UA 172 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This course will center on the concepts  of mimesis and its poor relation, mimicry. Mimesis refers to the way  in which aesthetic works refer: that is, it is about the  representation of reality in art. Mimicry is about closely imitating  the superficial characteristics of something or someone: it tends to  be less about art and more about life. Together, these concepts  provoke anxiety and interest about the ways in which reality and the  people and things in it can be reproduced, copied, faked, and  fictionalized. We will explore the related concepts of denotation,  appropriation, reference, plagiarism, and repetition. Texts may  include: Plato\u2019s Phaedrus ; Aristotle\u2019s Poetics ;  Michael Taussig\u2019s Mimesis and Alterity ; Derrida\u2019s   Dissemination ; Svetlana Alper\u2019s The Art of Describing ;  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Reality Effect;\u201d Homi Bhabha, \u201cOf Mimicry  and Man;\u201d Luce Irigary, Speculum of the Other Woman ; Eric  Lott, Love and Theft ; Theodor Adorno, \u201cThe Radio Voice.\u201d   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 002.

She is currently working on a book about fictionality,  reference and metalepsis.            The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:15 p.m.      In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth\u201d. While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late fifteenth  through the late seventeenth centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism  (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and  Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those  accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and  sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about  the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read  transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations,  historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an  Inquisitor\u2019s manual with instructions for torture, a witch hunting  treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more  contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers  Karamazov , Monty Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish  Inquisition\u201d skit, and the film adaptation of J.K.

Mapping AHSEM-UA 174 Instructor: Hilary Ballon Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      Maps are complex artifacts, both  pictorial and abstract, technical and symbolic, works of art and  science. This course will consider maps as ways of understanding,  picturing and abstracting the world, with examples from ancient Egypt  to Google Earth. Over time maps have become increasingly accurate,  built with precise measurements and rich with data, but they are also  ways of representing the world and conveying particular values and  ideas. With maps fast becoming a preferred scaffolding to organize  and access data\u2014witness, for example, the many applications of  Google Maps\u2014the rich history and complex nature of mapping has  particular relevance today. Topics to be covered in the seminar  include: Ptolemy\u2019s Geography ; world maps ( mappa mundi )  and cosmographical diagrams; mapping and geographic exploration; the  development of world atlases; the invention of true city plans;  warfare, state building and mapmaking; mapping as a tool of empire;  surveying and land ownership; Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  and spatial analysis; and experimental maps in contemporary art.   Cross-listed with Wagner as UPADM-GP 281.      Hilary Ballon is a University  Professor, and a professor of architecture and urban studies at NYU\u2019s  Robert F.

Ballon\u2019s scholarship focuses on  cities and the intersection of architecture, politics, and social  life in two fields of research, 20th-century America (in particular,  New York City) and 17th-century Europe (in particular, Paris). Her  current project concerns the grid plan of Manhattan, which is  celebrating its bicentennial in 2011. She is curating an exhibition  \u201cThe Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan,\u201d opening in  December 2011 at the Museum of the City of New York, and is editor of  the related book (Columbia University Press, 2011).    Ancient Egyptian Funerary Literature  and the Book of the Dead AHSEM-UA 175 Instructor: Rita Lucarelli Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.      This seminar gives an overview on the  religion of Pharaonic Egypt, on the basis of the numerous textual and  iconographical sources decorating tombs, coffins, papyri and other  funerary objects. In particular, the focus will be on the so-called  Book of the Dead, a collection of illustrated magical spells that  were in use in Egypt from about 1500 BCE until the Greco-Roman  period. The students will read a selection of spells (in translation)  from the Book of the Dead and analyze the illustrations related to  these texts, and will discuss aspects of the ancient Egyptian beliefs  in death and the netherworld. The ancient Egyptian pantheon of the  gods occurring in the sources will be presented and the complex  relationship among official religion, creation myths, personal piety  and everyday magical practices will be outlined and discussed in the  light of the most recent studies on the mortuary and magical  literature of ancient Egypt.      Rita Lucarelli is a Visiting Research  Scholar at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World  (ISAW). She studied at the University of Naples \u201cL\u2019Orientale,\u201d  Italy, where she took her MA degree in Classical Languages and  Egyptology. She holds her Ph.D. from Leiden University, The  Netherlands (2005) and her Ph.D. thesis was published in 2006 as The  Book of the Dead of Gatseshen: Ancient Egyptian Funerary Religion in  the 10th Century BC . Currently she works as Research Scholar at  the Book of the Dead Project of the University of Bonn, Germany. Her  primary research interests are the magical and funerary compositions  of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman Egypt, in particular those of the  so-called \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d papyri whose contents aimed at the  protection of the dead during his journey in the netherworld. She is  also currently preparing a monograph on demonology in ancient Egypt.  During her stay at the ISAW she will develop her research on  demonology on an interdisciplinary level, by comparing the beliefs in  demons in ancient Egypt with those in Mesopotamia during the 1st  Millennium BCE.            The NYU Mediation Lab: Sci-Fi  Edition AHSEM-UA 176 Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      MIT has its famous Media Lab \u201cto  envision the impact of emerging technologies.\u201d NYU now has its own  laboratory/workshop\u2014The Mediation Lab\u2014where we will scale up our  visions to include \u201cmedia\u201d of every kind. As our shorthand for  the work done by tools, \u201cmediation\u201d embraces all forms of  agency\u2014technological and human\u2014everything that intervenes,  enables, supplements, or acts in and on the world. This lab is thus  for students across the disciplines who want to participate in the  making of new knowledge\u2014knowledge that anticipates a future. Our  choice of project(s) for this edition of the Lab will be guided by  the genre best known for envisioning futures: science fiction. Our  selection of SF texts will be framed by turns to both the past\u2014Sir  Francis Bacon\u2019s arguments about new tools and new knowledge\u2014and  the present\u2014the physicist David Deutsch\u2019s new book The  Beginning of Infinity . The point of working together as a \u201clab\u201d  rather than a \u201cseminar\u201d is that we will do as well as think\u2014and  do so collaboratively rather than solely as individuals. Cross-listed  with English as ENGL-UA 800, section 002.      Clifford Siskin is the Henry W. and  Alfred A. Berg Professor of English and American Literature and the  Director of The Re:Enlightenment Project. His subject is the  interrelations of literary, social, and technological change. Links  between past and present inform all of his work, from his sequencing  of the genres of subjectivity ( The Historicity of Romantic  Discourse ) to his recovery of literature\u2019s role in the  formation of the modern disciplines ( The Work of Writing ). He  is also co-editor, with William Warner, of This Is Enlightenment ,  and a forthcoming monograph that asks when and how the central genre  of Enlightenment became the thing that we now love to blame: the  SYSTEM.    Irish History: Famine, Empire, and  Colonialism AHSEM-UA 177 Instructor: Joe Lee Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      The Great Famine of 1845-1851 was an  immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people and was the  catalyst for substantial changes\u2014positive and negative\u2014in Irish  society and culture; it also provoked a long history of debates about  the causes and solutions to global hunger that continue to resonate  today. This course explores the relationship between politics, power  and famine, with particular reference to the influence of political  cultures and institutions on decision making in the modern world,  through a number of case studies over the past two centuries. It  analyses the debates on the Amartya Sen thesis, that famines in the  modern world are due less to the failure of food-supply as such, and  more to the failure of non-democratic political systems. We will  explore a series of case\u2013studies of specific famines, including  Ireland (1845-52), Finland (1868), Bengal (1943-44, 1974-75) Russia  /USSR (1893, 1920-1, 1932-4), China (1964), and Ethiopia (1983-5).   Cross-listed with Irish Studies as IRISH-UA 185, and with History  as HIST-UA 799. Please note that this course does not satisfy the  advanced research seminar requirement for the history major.

Casey. Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others. Films to be screened and discussed include \u201cCrows and Sparrows\u201d and \u201cThe World.\u201d Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts &amp; Science and the Department of East Asian Studies.

Love, Prophecy and Madness in Arabic Literature and Islamic Culture, 7th-16th century AHSEM-UA 179 Instructor: Maurice Pomerantz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. In this course we will consider the important role that conceptions of love, prophecy and madness have played in religion, literature and culture in the Muslim world and its neighbors from the 7th-16th century. We will first consider earlier Ancient Near Eastern conceptions of the triad found in the Hebrew Bible, Ancient Greek thought (Plato, Aristotle, and later commentators). We will then address major works of Arabic literature and Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thought from the 7th-15th centuries, including the following topics/texts: Pre-Islamic Poetry; Qur'anic conceptions of prophecy/poetry/madness; Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q's \"Life of the Prophet\"; the themes of lovesickness and madness in early Arabic Love Poetry (Ghazal); stories of early wise fools and sufi mystics; the Maq\u0101m\u0101t of al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (11th century); the Arabian Nights; the Hebrew Poet Ibn Gabriol; the Persian Romance, Layli and Majnun_(madman); and Troubador Poetry. We will also read accounts of these themes in the works of the Muslim physicians, philosophers, and theologians (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b), and discuss the ways in which concepts of Love, Madness and Prophecy were received in the Medieval West and during the Renaissance and beyond.

Our mission  is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global  citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for  student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly  communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced  Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished  faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we  think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the  intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They  challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and  beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual  responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world.      In spring 2005, the College of Arts and  Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends  the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to  upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and, if space  allows, seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the  College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and  from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental  leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars  are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes  toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count  only as electives.      Advanced Honors Seminars have three  central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between  exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students  intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking,  writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in  and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant  or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly  insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of  students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year!        G. Gabrielle Starr Acting Dean of the College        Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs          Course  Descriptions Winter 2012 The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Case  Study in Literary Research AHSEM-UA 126 Instructor: Marvin Taylor Monday through Friday, 12:30-3:20 p.m. Winter Session runs January 3-21, 2012      Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel, The  Picture of Dorian Gray , is a cultural lightning rod. When it was  first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the  newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as \u201cmorbid\u201d  and \u201cunhealthy\u201d\u2014coded language that suggested homosexuality to  the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication  history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the  U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel  provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in  its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the  novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s  correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text.  Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s  London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere  Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement  philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d  late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian  ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do  in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these  topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The  goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how  vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 001.      Marvin Taylor is Director of the Fales  Library and Special Collections at NYU. He holds degrees from Indiana  University in Comparative Literature and Library Science, and in  English Literature from NYU. He has held positions at the Lilly  Library, Indiana University and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library,  and the Health Sciences Library at Columbia University before coming  to NYU. Taylor has taught literary methodology, queer theory,  Victorian literature, and contemporary art history all from the  perspective of primary research in archives. His research about, and  interest in, Oscar Wilde led to his inclusion in the dramatis  personae of Moises Kaufman\u2019s play, Gross Indecency: The Three  Trials of Oscar Wilde.          Spring 2012            A History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will take up an extended  history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of  religion). It will begin with references to anthropology, the Hebrews  and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of  disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then will follow the uneven  progress of this idea and its consequences in Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the  19th century, when disbelief was allied with radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course  will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the  most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief.  Readings may include selections from the Bible, as well as work by  Cicero, Hume, Mill, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Derrida, among  others.      Mitchell Stephens is Professor of  Journalism. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of  the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His  articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and  other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , Washington  Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. He is  currently writing books on the future of journalism and on the  history of disbelief.            \u201c Varieties of Religious  Experience\u201d Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will utilize but also  update William James\u2019s pioneering approach to interpreting and  understanding religion in psychological rather than theological  terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing  than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of  utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of  cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon  of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism,  apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort  modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the  vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral,  legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost  their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the  political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and  contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding and experience that are  consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being  reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this  is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both  culture and personality will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the  population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the  pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two  centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced  with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time  of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march  forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular  languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence  for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest  periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of  the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and  Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who  transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who  informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many  historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible  of all the centuries before the 21st. Cross-listed with History as  HIST-UA 105.

The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.      Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.

Edmund Wilson and the Art of  Cultural Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Instructor: Paul Berman Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic , the New  Yorker , the New York Review of Books and other magazines.  Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a  series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of  Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary  modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War;  and various traditions of American thought and literature over the  centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of  journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational  ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply  Wilson\u2019s principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an  extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a  better writer.

He has received fellowships from the MacArthur and  Guggenheim foundations, among other awards.            Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Instructor: Michael Nash Monday, 2:00-4:45 p.m.      Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and  read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students  will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly  basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources,  interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research  questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664. Please note  that this course does not satisfy the advanced research seminar  requirement for the history major.      Michael Nash is the Director of the  Tamiment Library and teaches in the History Department. He is  co-director of NYU\u2019s Center for the United States and the Cold War  and the Frederic Ewen Academic Freedom Center.

Political Cinema and Representation  of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is  viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be  eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternately,  reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus  primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most  conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also  explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United  States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will  explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically  and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in  filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history,  especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and  violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.   Cross-listed with Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies as MEIS-UA  170.

His film Hot House won the Special  Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. Dotan has taught filmmaking and film  studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University  in Montreal, and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of  America.            Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014 novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s  \u201cWhat is Literature.\u201d Cross-listed with Comparative Literature  as COLIT-UA 181.

His most recent book is From the Left Bank:  Reflections on Contemporary French Theater and Fiction . He has  organized many literary conferences and festivals in New York and  Paris, and was the Artistic Director of the six-month long \u201cBeckett  100\u201d centennial event in Paris. He has received numerous  decorations from the French government as well as the Grand Prize of  the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. He earned an OBIE award for achievement in  Off-Broadway Theatre.            Mimesis and Mimicry AHSEM-UA 172 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This course will center on the concepts  of mimesis and its poor relation, mimicry. Mimesis refers to the way  in which aesthetic works refer: that is, it is about the  representation of reality in art. Mimicry is about closely imitating  the superficial characteristics of something or someone: it tends to  be less about art and more about life. Together, these concepts  provoke anxiety and interest about the ways in which reality and the  people and things in it can be reproduced, copied, faked, and  fictionalized. We will explore the related concepts of denotation,  appropriation, reference, plagiarism, and repetition. Texts may  include: Plato\u2019s Phaedrus ; Aristotle\u2019s Poetics ;  Michael Taussig\u2019s Mimesis and Alterity ; Derrida\u2019s   Dissemination ; Svetlana Alper\u2019s The Art of Describing ;  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Reality Effect;\u201d Homi Bhabha, \u201cOf Mimicry  and Man;\u201d Luce Irigary, Speculum of the Other Woman ; Eric  Lott, Love and Theft ; Theodor Adorno, \u201cThe Radio Voice.\u201d   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 002.      Elaine Freedgood is the author of   Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a  Dangerous World (Cambridge 2000) and The Ideas in Things:  Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago 2006), and also  the editor of Factory Production in Victorian Britain (Oxford  2003). She is currently working on a book about fictionality,  reference and metalepsis.            The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:15 p.m.      In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth\u201d. While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late fifteenth  through the late seventeenth centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism  (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and  Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those  accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and  sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about  the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read  transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations,  historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an  Inquisitor\u2019s manual with instructions for torture, a witch hunting  treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more  contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers  Karamazov , Monty Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish  Inquisition\u201d skit, and the film adaptation of J.K. Rowling\u2019s 2003   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Cross-listed with  Spanish as SPAN-UA 952.

Mapping AHSEM-UA 174 Instructor: Hilary Ballon Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      Maps are complex artifacts, both  pictorial and abstract, technical and symbolic, works of art and  science. This course will consider maps as ways of understanding,  picturing and abstracting the world, with examples from ancient Egypt  to Google Earth. Over time maps have become increasingly accurate,  built with precise measurements and rich with data, but they are also  ways of representing the world and conveying particular values and  ideas. With maps fast becoming a preferred scaffolding to organize  and access data\u2014witness, for example, the many applications of  Google Maps\u2014the rich history and complex nature of mapping has  particular relevance today. Topics to be covered in the seminar  include: Ptolemy\u2019s Geography ; world maps ( mappa mundi )  and cosmographical diagrams; mapping and geographic exploration; the  development of world atlases; the invention of true city plans;  warfare, state building and mapmaking; mapping as a tool of empire;  surveying and land ownership; Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  and spatial analysis; and experimental maps in contemporary art.   Cross-listed with Wagner as UPADM-GP 281.      Hilary Ballon is a University  Professor, and a professor of architecture and urban studies at NYU\u2019s  Robert F.

Ballon\u2019s scholarship focuses on  cities and the intersection of architecture, politics, and social  life in two fields of research, 20th-century America (in particular,  New York City) and 17th-century Europe (in particular, Paris). Her  current project concerns the grid plan of Manhattan, which is  celebrating its bicentennial in 2011. She is curating an exhibition  \u201cThe Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan,\u201d opening in  December 2011 at the Museum of the City of New York, and is editor of  the related book (Columbia University Press, 2011).    Ancient Egyptian Funerary Literature  and the Book of the Dead AHSEM-UA 175 Instructor: Rita Lucarelli Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.      This seminar gives an overview on the  religion of Pharaonic Egypt, on the basis of the numerous textual and  iconographical sources decorating tombs, coffins, papyri and other  funerary objects. In particular, the focus will be on the so-called  Book of the Dead, a collection of illustrated magical spells that  were in use in Egypt from about 1500 BCE until the Greco-Roman  period. The students will read a selection of spells (in translation)  from the Book of the Dead and analyze the illustrations related to  these texts, and will discuss aspects of the ancient Egyptian beliefs  in death and the netherworld. The ancient Egyptian pantheon of the  gods occurring in the sources will be presented and the complex  relationship among official religion, creation myths, personal piety  and everyday magical practices will be outlined and discussed in the  light of the most recent studies on the mortuary and magical  literature of ancient Egypt.      Rita Lucarelli is a Visiting Research  Scholar at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World  (ISAW). She studied at the University of Naples \u201cL\u2019Orientale,\u201d  Italy, where she took her MA degree in Classical Languages and  Egyptology. She holds her Ph.D. from Leiden University, The  Netherlands (2005) and her Ph.D. thesis was published in 2006 as The  Book of the Dead of Gatseshen: Ancient Egyptian Funerary Religion in  the 10th Century BC . Currently she works as Research Scholar at  the Book of the Dead Project of the University of Bonn, Germany. Her  primary research interests are the magical and funerary compositions  of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman Egypt, in particular those of the  so-called \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d papyri whose contents aimed at the  protection of the dead during his journey in the netherworld. She is  also currently preparing a monograph on demonology in ancient Egypt.  During her stay at the ISAW she will develop her research on  demonology on an interdisciplinary level, by comparing the beliefs in  demons in ancient Egypt with those in Mesopotamia during the 1st  Millennium BCE.            The NYU Mediation Lab: Sci-Fi  Edition AHSEM-UA 176 Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      MIT has its famous Media Lab \u201cto  envision the impact of emerging technologies.\u201d NYU now has its own  laboratory/workshop\u2014The Mediation Lab\u2014where we will scale up our  visions to include \u201cmedia\u201d of every kind. As our shorthand for  the work done by tools, \u201cmediation\u201d embraces all forms of  agency\u2014technological and human\u2014everything that intervenes,  enables, supplements, or acts in and on the world. This lab is thus  for students across the disciplines who want to participate in the  making of new knowledge\u2014knowledge that anticipates a future. Our  choice of project(s) for this edition of the Lab will be guided by  the genre best known for envisioning futures: science fiction. Our  selection of SF texts will be framed by turns to both the past\u2014Sir  Francis Bacon\u2019s arguments about new tools and new knowledge\u2014and  the present\u2014the physicist David Deutsch\u2019s new book The  Beginning of Infinity . The point of working together as a \u201clab\u201d  rather than a \u201cseminar\u201d is that we will do as well as think\u2014and  do so collaboratively rather than solely as individuals. Cross-listed  with English as ENGL-UA 800, section 002.      Clifford Siskin is the Henry W. and  Alfred A. Berg Professor of English and American Literature and the  Director of The Re:Enlightenment Project. His subject is the  interrelations of literary, social, and technological change. Links  between past and present inform all of his work, from his sequencing  of the genres of subjectivity ( The Historicity of Romantic  Discourse ) to his recovery of literature\u2019s role in the  formation of the modern disciplines ( The Work of Writing ). He  is also co-editor, with William Warner, of This Is Enlightenment ,  and a forthcoming monograph that asks when and how the central genre  of Enlightenment became the thing that we now love to blame: the  SYSTEM.    Irish History: Famine, Empire, and  Colonialism AHSEM-UA 177 Instructor: Joe Lee Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      The Great Famine of 1845-1851 was an  immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people and was the  catalyst for substantial changes\u2014positive and negative\u2014in Irish  society and culture; it also provoked a long history of debates about  the causes and solutions to global hunger that continue to resonate  today. This course explores the relationship between politics, power  and famine, with particular reference to the influence of political  cultures and institutions on decision making in the modern world,  through a number of case studies over the past two centuries. It  analyses the debates on the Amartya Sen thesis, that famines in the  modern world are due less to the failure of food-supply as such, and  more to the failure of non-democratic political systems. We will  explore a series of case\u2013studies of specific famines, including  Ireland (1845-52), Finland (1868), Bengal (1943-44, 1974-75) Russia  /USSR (1893, 1920-1, 1932-4), China (1964), and Ethiopia (1983-5).

Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others. Films to be screened and discussed include \u201cCrows and Sparrows\u201d and \u201cThe World.\u201d Jing Wang is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts &amp; Science and the Department of East Asian Studies.

Love, Prophecy and Madness in Arabic Literature and Islamic Culture, 7th-16th century AHSEM-UA 179 Instructor: Maurice Pomerantz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. In this course we will consider the important role that conceptions of love, prophecy and madness have played in religion, literature and culture in the Muslim world and its neighbors from the 7th-16th century. We will first consider earlier Ancient Near Eastern conceptions of the triad found in the Hebrew Bible, Ancient Greek thought (Plato, Aristotle, and later commentators). We will then address major works of Arabic literature and Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thought from the 7th-15th centuries, including the following topics/texts: Pre-Islamic Poetry; Qur'anic conceptions of prophecy/poetry/madness; Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q's \"Life of the Prophet\"; the themes of lovesickness and madness in early Arabic Love Poetry (Ghazal); stories of early wise fools and sufi mystics; the Maq\u0101m\u0101t of al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (11th century); the Arabian Nights; the Hebrew Poet Ibn Gabriol; the Persian Romance, Layli and Majnun_(madman); and Troubador Poetry. We will also read accounts of these themes in the works of the Muslim physicians, philosophers, and theologians (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b), and discuss the ways in which concepts of Love, Madness and Prophecy were received in the Medieval West and during the Renaissance and beyond.

Our mission  is to prepare students to be thought leaders and successful global  citizens. We do this by creating unique academic opportunities for  student and faculty engagement that emphasize research and scholarly  communication. Part of the College\u2019s Honors Program, the Advanced  Honors Seminars place students in small classes with distinguished  faculty to study topics that have the potential to change how we  think and how we work. As such, they are ideal gateways for the  intellectually stimulating discussions we aim to foster. They  challenge students and faculty to engage intensively within and  beyond their fields of study, and they inspire intellectual  responsibility towards the scholarly community and the wider world.      In spring 2005, the College of Arts and  Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends  the basic principles behind the Freshman Honors Seminars to  upper-level courses (open to sophomores, juniors, and, if space  allows, seniors). Distinguished professors drawn not only from the  College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools, and  from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental  leaders, teach these small classes. In many instances, the seminars  are cross-listed with departments and students may count the classes  toward their majors or minors; in some cases, the classes will count  only as electives.      Advanced Honors Seminars have three  central goals: to create close mentoring relationships between  exceptional faculty and students; to challenge students  intellectually through honors-level work in critical thinking,  writing, and conversing; and to strengthen students\u2019 interest in  and aptitude for conducting independent research (e.g. a DURF grant  or a Senior Honors Thesis). They are designed to foster scholarly  insight and debate and to nurture the intellectual passions of  students and faculty alike. We encourage you to try one this year!        G. Gabrielle Starr Acting Dean of the College        Patrick Deer Director of College Honors Programs          Course  Descriptions Winter 2012 The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Case  Study in Literary Research AHSEM-UA 126 Instructor: Marvin Taylor Monday through Friday, 12:30-3:20 p.m. Winter Session runs January 3-21, 2012      Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel, The  Picture of Dorian Gray , is a cultural lightning rod. When it was  first published in England, a firestorm of criticism hit the  newspapers and literary magazines, decrying the work as \u201cmorbid\u201d  and \u201cunhealthy\u201d\u2014coded language that suggested homosexuality to  the late-Victorian public. The novel has a complicated publication  history. It survives in two versions: the first was published in the  U. S., six months before it appeared in England. Wilde\u2019s novel  provides a perfect case study in how to approach a literary text in  its historical context. This three-week course will focus on the  novel\u2019s various manuscript and print versions, Wilde\u2019s  correspondence about the work, and critical responses to the text.  Various themes of the work will be addressed, such as Wilde\u2019s  London, yellow journalism, British jurisprudence, the Labouchere  Amendment, the language of flowers, opium dens, Aesthetic Movement  philosophy, East End theater, 1890s fashion, \u201cinversion,\u201d  late-Victorian portraiture, bibliophilia, book design, Victorian  ghost stories, and French decadence. Students will be required to do  in-depth research with the Fales Library\u2019s holdings exploring these  topics and their relevance to our understanding of the novel. The  goal will be to allow students to do primary research and to see how  vital original sources are for the study of literary texts.   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 001.      Marvin Taylor is Director of the Fales  Library and Special Collections at NYU. He holds degrees from Indiana  University in Comparative Literature and Library Science, and in  English Literature from NYU. He has held positions at the Lilly  Library, Indiana University and the Rare Book and Manuscript Library,  and the Health Sciences Library at Columbia University before coming  to NYU. Taylor has taught literary methodology, queer theory,  Victorian literature, and contemporary art history all from the  perspective of primary research in archives. His research about, and  interest in, Oscar Wilde led to his inclusion in the dramatis  personae of Moises Kaufman\u2019s play, Gross Indecency: The Three  Trials of Oscar Wilde.          Spring 2012            A History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will take up an extended  history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of  religion). It will begin with references to anthropology, the Hebrews  and India, before discussing the skeptics and the development of  disbelief in Greece and Rome. The course then will follow the uneven  progress of this idea and its consequences in Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  Romantic period. Time will be spent in England and America in the  19th century, when disbelief was allied with radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course  will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the  most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief.  Readings may include selections from the Bible, as well as work by  Cicero, Hume, Mill, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Derrida, among  others.      Mitchell Stephens is Professor of  Journalism. He is the author of, among other books, the rise of  the image the fall of the word and A History of News . His  articles on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and  other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , Washington  Post , Los Angeles Times , and other publications. He is  currently writing books on the future of journalism and on the  history of disbelief.            \u201c Varieties of Religious  Experience\u201d Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This seminar will utilize but also  update William James\u2019s pioneering approach to interpreting and  understanding religion in psychological rather than theological  terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing  than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of  utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of  cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon  of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism,  apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort  modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the  vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral,  legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost  their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the  political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and  contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding and experience that are  consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being  reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this  is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both  culture and personality will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was a time of the Black Death and the decimation of the  population on an enormous scale; a time of recession that changed the  pattern of prosperity that had existed in the preceding two  centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman Church were faced  with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious authority; a time  of wars and rebellions. Yet, in the same era, there was a march  forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms, vernacular  languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense consequence  for all of Europe\u2026 and for our own culture. Through the darkest  periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the beginnings of  the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of Petrarch and  Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian painters who  transformed the nature and conception of literature and art and who  informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century that many  historians have understood as the most creative and the most terrible  of all the centuries before the 21st. Cross-listed with History as  HIST-UA 105.

The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Instructor: Deborah Willis Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.      Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums and galleries. Each week students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.

Edmund Wilson and the Art of  Cultural Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Instructor: Paul Berman Tuesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic , the New  Yorker , the New York Review of Books and other magazines.  Reading a substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a  series of large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of  Greenwich Village early in the 20th century; the rise of literary  modernism; the influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War;  and various traditions of American thought and literature over the  centuries. We will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of  journalistic writing: his emphases on clarity, on conversational  ease, and on emotional forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply  Wilson\u2019s principles of writing to their own compositions\u2014an  extremely useful thing to do for any student who seeks to become a  better writer.

Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Instructor: Michael Nash Monday, 2:00-4:45 p.m.      Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It will explore  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, oral memoirs, view films, and  read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, will be our laboratory. Students  will work with archives and other special collections on a weekly  basis. They will learn how to use and evaluate these primary sources,  interpret evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research  questions. Cross-listed with History as HIST-UA 664.

Political Cinema and Representation  of the \u2018Other\u2019 AHSEM-UA 170 Instructor: Shimon Dotan Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.      In contemporary war, the \u2018Other\u2019 is  viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be  eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against or, alternately,  reinforce, such deadly representations? This seminar will focus  primarily, though not exclusively, on one of the world\u2019s most  conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East\u2014though it will also  explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, France and the United  States. Through selected readings and film screenings, we will  explore how the \u2018Other\u2019 is constructed politically, aesthetically  and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in  filmmaking and film criticism, in contemporary politics and history,  especially those of the Middle East, in cinema of conflict and  violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.

Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014 novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s  \u201cWhat is Literature.\u201d Cross-listed with Comparative Literature  as COLIT-UA 181.

He earned an OBIE award for achievement in  Off-Broadway Theatre.            Mimesis and Mimicry AHSEM-UA 172 Instructor: Elaine Freedgood Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.      This course will center on the concepts  of mimesis and its poor relation, mimicry. Mimesis refers to the way  in which aesthetic works refer: that is, it is about the  representation of reality in art. Mimicry is about closely imitating  the superficial characteristics of something or someone: it tends to  be less about art and more about life. Together, these concepts  provoke anxiety and interest about the ways in which reality and the  people and things in it can be reproduced, copied, faked, and  fictionalized. We will explore the related concepts of denotation,  appropriation, reference, plagiarism, and repetition. Texts may  include: Plato\u2019s Phaedrus ; Aristotle\u2019s Poetics ;  Michael Taussig\u2019s Mimesis and Alterity ; Derrida\u2019s   Dissemination ; Svetlana Alper\u2019s The Art of Describing ;  Roland Barthes, \u201cThe Reality Effect;\u201d Homi Bhabha, \u201cOf Mimicry  and Man;\u201d Luce Irigary, Speculum of the Other Woman ; Eric  Lott, Love and Theft ; Theodor Adorno, \u201cThe Radio Voice.\u201d   Cross-listed with English as ENGL-UA 252, section 002.

She is currently working on a book about fictionality,  reference and metalepsis.            The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:15 p.m.      In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth\u201d. While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late fifteenth  through the late seventeenth centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism  (the conversos), Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and  Illuminati, witches, Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those  accused of sexual or religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and  sodomy). We close the semester considering what finally brought about  the definitive abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read  transcripts from Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations,  historical chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an  Inquisitor\u2019s manual with instructions for torture, a witch hunting  treatise, and devotional literature. We also will examine more  contemporary reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers  Karamazov , Monty Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish  Inquisition\u201d skit, and the film adaptation of J.K. Rowling\u2019s 2003   Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Cross-listed with  Spanish as SPAN-UA 952.

Mapping AHSEM-UA 174 Instructor: Hilary Ballon Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.      Maps are complex artifacts, both  pictorial and abstract, technical and symbolic, works of art and  science. This course will consider maps as ways of understanding,  picturing and abstracting the world, with examples from ancient Egypt  to Google Earth. Over time maps have become increasingly accurate,  built with precise measurements and rich with data, but they are also  ways of representing the world and conveying particular values and  ideas. With maps fast becoming a preferred scaffolding to organize  and access data\u2014witness, for example, the many applications of  Google Maps\u2014the rich history and complex nature of mapping has  particular relevance today. Topics to be covered in the seminar  include: Ptolemy\u2019s Geography ; world maps ( mappa mundi )  and cosmographical diagrams; mapping and geographic exploration; the  development of world atlases; the invention of true city plans;  warfare, state building and mapmaking; mapping as a tool of empire;  surveying and land ownership; Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  and spatial analysis; and experimental maps in contemporary art.   Cross-listed with Wagner as UPADM-GP 281.      Hilary Ballon is a University  Professor, and a professor of architecture and urban studies at NYU\u2019s  Robert F.

Ballon\u2019s scholarship focuses on  cities and the intersection of architecture, politics, and social  life in two fields of research, 20th-century America (in particular,  New York City) and 17th-century Europe (in particular, Paris). Her  current project concerns the grid plan of Manhattan, which is  celebrating its bicentennial in 2011. She is curating an exhibition  \u201cThe Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan,\u201d opening in  December 2011 at the Museum of the City of New York, and is editor of  the related book (Columbia University Press, 2011).    Ancient Egyptian Funerary Literature  and the Book of the Dead AHSEM-UA 175 Instructor: Rita Lucarelli Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.      This seminar gives an overview on the  religion of Pharaonic Egypt, on the basis of the numerous textual and  iconographical sources decorating tombs, coffins, papyri and other  funerary objects. In particular, the focus will be on the so-called  Book of the Dead, a collection of illustrated magical spells that  were in use in Egypt from about 1500 BCE until the Greco-Roman  period. The students will read a selection of spells (in translation)  from the Book of the Dead and analyze the illustrations related to  these texts, and will discuss aspects of the ancient Egyptian beliefs  in death and the netherworld. The ancient Egyptian pantheon of the  gods occurring in the sources will be presented and the complex  relationship among official religion, creation myths, personal piety  and everyday magical practices will be outlined and discussed in the  light of the most recent studies on the mortuary and magical  literature of ancient Egypt.      Rita Lucarelli is a Visiting Research  Scholar at NYU\u2019s Institute for the Study of the Ancient World  (ISAW). She studied at the University of Naples \u201cL\u2019Orientale,\u201d  Italy, where she took her MA degree in Classical Languages and  Egyptology. She holds her Ph.D. from Leiden University, The  Netherlands (2005) and her Ph.D. thesis was published in 2006 as The  Book of the Dead of Gatseshen: Ancient Egyptian Funerary Religion in  the 10th Century BC . Currently she works as Research Scholar at  the Book of the Dead Project of the University of Bonn, Germany. Her  primary research interests are the magical and funerary compositions  of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman Egypt, in particular those of the  so-called \u201cBook of the Dead\u201d papyri whose contents aimed at the  protection of the dead during his journey in the netherworld. She is  also currently preparing a monograph on demonology in ancient Egypt.  During her stay at the ISAW she will develop her research on  demonology on an interdisciplinary level, by comparing the beliefs in  demons in ancient Egypt with those in Mesopotamia during the 1st  Millennium BCE.            The NYU Mediation Lab: Sci-Fi  Edition AHSEM-UA 176 Instructor: Clifford Siskin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      MIT has its famous Media Lab \u201cto  envision the impact of emerging technologies.\u201d NYU now has its own  laboratory/workshop\u2014The Mediation Lab\u2014where we will scale up our  visions to include \u201cmedia\u201d of every kind. As our shorthand for  the work done by tools, \u201cmediation\u201d embraces all forms of  agency\u2014technological and human\u2014everything that intervenes,  enables, supplements, or acts in and on the world. This lab is thus  for students across the disciplines who want to participate in the  making of new knowledge\u2014knowledge that anticipates a future. Our  choice of project(s) for this edition of the Lab will be guided by  the genre best known for envisioning futures: science fiction. Our  selection of SF texts will be framed by turns to both the past\u2014Sir  Francis Bacon\u2019s arguments about new tools and new knowledge\u2014and  the present\u2014the physicist David Deutsch\u2019s new book The  Beginning of Infinity . The point of working together as a \u201clab\u201d  rather than a \u201cseminar\u201d is that we will do as well as think\u2014and  do so collaboratively rather than solely as individuals. Cross-listed  with English as ENGL-UA 800, section 002.      Clifford Siskin is the Henry W. and  Alfred A. Berg Professor of English and American Literature and the  Director of The Re:Enlightenment Project. His subject is the  interrelations of literary, social, and technological change. Links  between past and present inform all of his work, from his sequencing  of the genres of subjectivity ( The Historicity of Romantic  Discourse ) to his recovery of literature\u2019s role in the  formation of the modern disciplines ( The Work of Writing ). He  is also co-editor, with William Warner, of This Is Enlightenment ,  and a forthcoming monograph that asks when and how the central genre  of Enlightenment became the thing that we now love to blame: the  SYSTEM.    Irish History: Famine, Empire, and  Colonialism AHSEM-UA 177 Instructor: Joe Lee Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m.      The Great Famine of 1845-1851 was an  immediate and long-term catastrophe for the Irish people and was the  catalyst for substantial changes\u2014positive and negative\u2014in Irish  society and culture; it also provoked a long history of debates about  the causes and solutions to global hunger that continue to resonate  today. This course explores the relationship between politics, power  and famine, with particular reference to the influence of political  cultures and institutions on decision making in the modern world,  through a number of case studies over the past two centuries. It  analyses the debates on the Amartya Sen thesis, that famines in the  modern world are due less to the failure of food-supply as such, and  more to the failure of non-democratic political systems. We will  explore a series of case\u2013studies of specific famines, including  Ireland (1845-52), Finland (1868), Bengal (1943-44, 1974-75) Russia  /USSR (1893, 1920-1, 1932-4), China (1964), and Ethiopia (1983-5).

Country and City in Modern Chinese Literature and Film AHSEM-UA 178 Instructor: Jing Wang Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. This Seminar focuses on the tension and mutual dependency between the country and the city in modern China through the prism of modern Chinese fiction and Chinese film. The story of modern China, in a sense, is the story of the transformation of a rural society into an urban, industrial one. This profound change in the socioeconomic sphere has produced equally profound changes in people\u2019s experience and consciousness, which in turn produce their cultural visions and artistic expressions. The story of modern China is also a story about an organic member of an intimate social setting (say the family or the village) who becomes an enlightened, independent but lonely and alienated \u201cindividual\u201d amidst the crowd of strangers in the modern city. Or, conversely, it is about this cosmopolitan intellectual or professional\u2019s uneasy return to the hometown, to the countryside, about his or her confrontation with an embarrassing past, which can be disengaged rationally but not emotionally. These issues, to be sure, are not unique or particular to China; rather, they speak to contemporary men and women worldwide. To study the particular historical experience and cultural formations of modern China may help us better grapple with many central concerns of contemporary life as well as our understanding of it. The compressed temporality in China\u2019s rapid metamorphosis from a sleepy rural giant to the \u201cworkshop of the world\u201d not only means the mushrooming of Chinese cities, but also, and more importantly, an intense drama of social change, moral conflict, cultural diversity, and emotional strain. All of these have found their representation in literature and film: the rural-urban relationship offers us an excellent opportunity to examine and rethink the epic experience of modern China as exemplary of the human experience of modernity. Writers and works to be discussed include Lu Xun\u2019s \u201cHometown\u201d and \u201cNew Year\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d; Lao She\u2019s \u201cCamel Xiangzi\u201d; Mao Dun\u2019s \u201cSpring Silkworm\u201d; Shen Congwen\u2019s \u201cVegetable Garden\u201d; Ailing Chang\u2019s \u201cSealed Off\u201d, among others.

Love, Prophecy and Madness in Arabic Literature and Islamic Culture, 7th-16th century AHSEM-UA 179 Instructor: Maurice Pomerantz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. In this course we will consider the important role that conceptions of love, prophecy and madness have played in religion, literature and culture in the Muslim world and its neighbors from the 7th-16th century. We will first consider earlier Ancient Near Eastern conceptions of the triad found in the Hebrew Bible, Ancient Greek thought (Plato, Aristotle, and later commentators). We will then address major works of Arabic literature and Islamic, Christian, and Jewish thought from the 7th-15th centuries, including the following topics/texts: Pre-Islamic Poetry; Qur'anic conceptions of prophecy/poetry/madness; Ibn Is\u1e25\u0101q's \"Life of the Prophet\"; the themes of lovesickness and madness in early Arabic Love Poetry (Ghazal); stories of early wise fools and sufi mystics; the Maq\u0101m\u0101t of al-Hamadh\u0101n\u012b (11th century); the Arabian Nights; the Hebrew Poet Ibn Gabriol; the Persian Romance, Layli and Majnun_(madman); and Troubador Poetry. We will also read accounts of these themes in the works of the Muslim physicians, philosophers, and theologians (al-F\u0101r\u0101b\u012b, Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 and al-Ghaz\u0101l\u012b), and discuss the ways in which concepts of Love, Madness and Prophecy were received in the Medieval West and during the Renaissance and beyond.
