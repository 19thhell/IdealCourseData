Mandatory Check-in The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires F-1 and NYU-sponsored J-1 students to check in with the Office of Global Services. For details, click here . Failure to attend a check-in workshop may jeopardize your ability to remain legally in the U.S.    You are responsible for maintaining your immigration status. Report any change in your local address immediately. For questions regarding your visa status, permission to work, and traveling outside the United States, contact: Alison Jackson in NYU's Office of Global Services , 561 LaGuardia Place, 212-998-4720, ogs@nyu.edu .    English Proficiency You are required to take the English proficiency exam at the American Language Institute (ALI) if English is not your first language or if you did not graduate from a college or university where English was the language of instruction. A TOEFL score does not exempt you from the ALI English proficiency exam.    Your academic department may require the exam regardless of your English proficiency. It is your responsibility to be proficient in English in order to meet academic course requirements.    Space at ALI exams is limited, so you must sign up for a test. Registration will be available by May.    Students may complete the ALI exam only once within any 12-month period. If you take the test twice, your second set of scores will be discarded.    Exams are given at the American Language Institute: 7 East 12th Street, Room 821 (phone number: 212 998 7040). A $20 testing fee must be paid on the day of your exam. The evaluation will take approximately two hours.    Review ALI Results with Student Services Staff Students who take the ALI English Proficiency Exam must meet with a Steinhardt Student Services staff member to review the results. Registration will be available by May.    ALI Class Registration Students who are matriculated in NYU Steinhardt will register for ALI courses in Albert along with their other courses. Students may only register for ALI courses approved for their proficiency level.    PLEASE NOTE: If your visa status is F-1 or J-1, you are required to register for full-time study, 12 credits or more unless you are taking courses at ALI. If you are required to take classes at the ALI, it may take more time than you had originally expected to finish your required studies and there will be additional tuition charges. Courses taken at ALI are designed to improve your proficiency in English; they do not count as credits toward degree requirements. If you are attending NYU as an F-1 or J-1 student, you must obtain permission from OGS in order to register for an ALI course in your first semester while you are also registered for at least 6 academic credits in your program. After your first semester (if an F-1 or J-1 visa holder) you must register for at least 12 credits as well as whatever ALI course your academic program requires.    New Student Seminar New Student Seminar for International Graduate Students (SAHS-GE 2003) is an opportunity to connect with other new students and obtain valuable information about working on- and off-campus, conducting library research, New York City, NYU Steinhardt, your academic experience, and more. ( Required of NYU Steinhardt international graduate students during their first semester of study. )    Please enroll yourself in one of the following fall 2014 sections:    The seminar runs for eight weeks and does not meet during the first week of classes; the first meeting will be during the second week of classes (Tuesday, September 9 through Monday, September 15).
