This new major enables a small number of very capable and highly motivated students to pursue a plan of study that brings together courses from more than one CAS department or program. During their sophomore year, students compose their academic plan for the major in consultation with their two faculty advisers for their self-designed program of study as well as with the Associate Director of Interschool Programs and the Director of College Honors, who serves as the Director of Undergraduate Studies. By Spring of the sophomore year, the plan of study must be submitted to and approved by the Honors Committee. The self-designed honors major differs from the individualized major that the Gallatin School offers in several ways: These two NYU schools have distinct admissions criteria, general education curricula, and other requirements This CAS major serves students who can realize their interdisciplinary goals within CAS (except for the 16 credits of non-CAS courses that CAS already permits), whereas Gallatin students draw heavily on courses from several NYU schools This CAS major is an honors major, which has prerequisites for entry (e.g., 3.75 GPA; students must maintain a 3.65 GPA to remain in the major) and entails a heavy commitment to honors-level work, including independent research under faculty supervision                 CAS Bulletin 2014-2016       An Introduction to New York University       Administration       A Brief History of the College of Arts and Science       College Directory       Calendar 2014&ndash;2016       The College Core Curriculum       College of Arts and Science Seminars       Departments and Programs       Cross-School Minors       Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs       Arts and Science Summer and Winter Programs       New York University Study Away       Admission       Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid       Registration, Advisement, and Counseling       Degree Requirements       Academic Policies       Honors and Awards       Student Activities, University Services and Community Service       Faculty of Arts and Science       Standing Committees in CAS and FAS       Majors and Minors as Registered by the New York State Education Department       Travel Directions to the Washington Square Campus       Archived Bulletins                    Back to List of Departments and Programs                     Contact Us                             Contact Us"}]},

This service enables you to checkout materials 24 hours a day and avoid lines at the circulation desk. Self-Service Checkout is available to current students or faculty members of NYU, New School, Cooper Union, NYSID, and patrons who otherwise have valid borrowing privileges at Bobst Library.     To use this service, you must have registered your library card at your home library's circulation desk. If you have previously checked out materials then you are registered. You must also be in good standing with the library - meaning you should not have any blocks on you circulation record, or owe more than $5 in fines.   Once you have checked out your materials, be sure to take the Date Due sticker receipt that prints, peel off the back, and affix it to the Bobst Library circulation sticker located in the back cover of the item. You will need this Date Due sticker in place to exit the library with your materials.   The Self-checkout machines are located on the far south end of the circulation desk in the Bobst Library atrium. If you have any questions while using the Self-Checkout machines during circulation desk hours, please ask a circulation staff member. If you are unable to checkout and it is after hours, please place your items on the day shelf, and inquire at the circulation desk when the department reopens. See Library Hours   We appreciate your feedback about this service. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Bobst Library Circulation Desk .
