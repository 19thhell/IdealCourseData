Open House / Information Session    To learn more about the program and the admissions process, please come to one of information sessions.    RSVP for an Information Session     Global Programs             Program Description    The MA programs in Counseling and Guidance are designed to provide education and clinical training that prepare students to become professional counselors working in either schools or colleges and community agencies. The program aims to develop professionals committed to the growth and development of the persons with whom they work. Students learn to understand clients in socio-historical contexts, including but not limited to gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. They examine issues of power and authority, and analyze their own role in counselor-client relationships.    School Counseling focuses on procedures and techniques for fostering healthy development in school-age children and their families. Bilingual School Counseling has a similar focus but with special attention paid to issues relevant to a bilingual student population.       See the required coursework.           The MA in Counseling and Guidance Program is accredited by the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC) for the period of January, 2015 through January, 2025.

RSVP for an Information Session     Global Programs             Program Description    The MA programs in Counseling and Guidance are designed to provide education and clinical training that prepare students to become professional counselors working in either schools or colleges and community agencies. The program aims to develop professionals committed to the growth and development of the persons with whom they work. Students learn to understand clients in socio-historical contexts, including but not limited to gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexual orientation. They examine issues of power and authority, and analyze their own role in counselor-client relationships.    School Counseling focuses on procedures and techniques for fostering healthy development in school-age children and their families. Bilingual School Counseling has a similar focus but with special attention paid to issues relevant to a bilingual student population.       See the required coursework.           The MA in Counseling and Guidance Program is accredited by the Masters in Psychology and Counseling Accreditation Council (MPCAC) for the period of January, 2015 through January, 2025.
