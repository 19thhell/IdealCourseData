We will examine how scientists convince themselves that these unseen things, such as atoms and molecules, are real. Many things cannot be seen or held in one\u2019s hand, but scientists claim to have detected and to understand them. We ask probing questions about what it means to \u201csee\u201d or \u201cobserve\u201d the world around us, and grapple with the basic question of how we gain scientific knowledge at all. Topics include telescopes and microscopes, atomic theory, the unconscious and psychoanalysis, human consciousness and intelligence, dark matter, and the nature of objectivity. We will pay special attention to how scientists are trained to see in particular ways, and how culture and worldview can shape, restrict, or enhance the way we observe. Readings include Galileo, Ernst Mach, Henry Adams, Stephen J. Gould, Peter Galison, T.S. Kuhn, Freud, Edward Tufte.

Visualizing something as complex as the history of the atomic bomb, however&mdash;from its scientific mechanics to its devastating history&mdash;can prove to be difficult. Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, the creator of Trinity: A Graphic History of the First Atomic Bomb , is a graphic novelist whose subjects are the bomb and its history. Fetter-Vorm illuminated the difficulties behind portraying this topic in his lecture, &ldquo;How to Draw the Invisible,&rdquo; held on November 11th and part of the Technology and Society Lecture Series, sponsored by the Technology, Culture and Society Department at the NYU School of Engineering.   After reading a brief excerpt from his book, Fetter-Vorm addressed three fundamental issues unique to creating a historic work based on a deadly scientific process that very few people have witnessed.   The first issue&mdash;&ldquo;How do I draw something I can&rsquo;t see?&rdquo;&mdash;addresses the fact that people who actually witness an atomic explosion usually don&rsquo;t survive it and that many of its processes are invisible to us. While photo reference exists of the explosions themselves that Fetter-Vorm was able to utilize, he also drew on analogies to explain the scientific designs behind atomic energy. &ldquo;I wanted to portray how difficult the science was without being too scientific,&rdquo; said Fetter-Vorm. In one example, he had illustrated intricate lines of falling dominoes in order to assist in visualizing the chain reaction needed for an atomic explosion to occur.   &ldquo;How do I draw something I didn&rsquo;t see?&rdquo; is the second issue, referring to the historical elements of the story that Fetter-Vorm was unable to witness himself. To explain his approach, he described the use of negative space. An example of negative space is the famous &ldquo;Rubin&rsquo;s vase&rdquo;&mdash;an optical illusion in which the positive space (the vase itself) also has a &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; image in its negative space (two people facing each other). What this idea implies is that the surrounding space around an object can assist in describing the object itself. This principle can be applied to storytelling when an author is writing about a historical figure. J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was central to the infamous Manhattan Project, apparently did not keep a memoir while employed there. Fetter-Vorm, however, was able to use the &ldquo;negative space&rdquo; in Oppenheimer&rsquo;s life to get a bigger sense of the picture by researching the histories of the people around him and studying contemporary schematics, maps, films, and photos.   The final issue is &ldquo;How do I draw something I don&rsquo;t want to see?&rdquo; This is arguably the most difficult as it deals with the real human cost of the atomic bomb. The author turned to Japanese post-war photographer Shomei Tomatsu, who, as part of a series, took photographs of everyday objects that were caught in the bomb blasts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and, as a result, were twisted beyond recognition. As described by Fetter-Vorm, it&rsquo;s a way of &ldquo;not looking at the damage done to people that would otherwise be too traumatic.&rdquo; He further demonstrated this point by showing an example from his book where a house is dramatically blown from its foundation while being caught in a blast; the imagery succeeds in portraying a visceral effect without gore.   An audience member asked Fetter-Vorm how he dealt with the overall mood of the country at the time in his piece. The artist responded that at the first part of the book, he wanted to reflect the excitement for the sciences, &ldquo;a great microcosm of exuberance.&rdquo; He also ironically noted that most scientists who worked on the atomic bomb were unaware of what their research was being applied to.   Trinity is Fetter-Vorm&rsquo;s first graphic novel, which was selected as the Best Graphic Novel for Teens in 2013 by the American Library Association. He is currently pursuing his MFA in creative non-fiction at Columbia University.

We will examine how scientists convince themselves that these unseen things, such as atoms and molecules, are real. Many things cannot be seen or held in one\u2019s hand, but scientists claim to have detected and to understand them. We ask probing questions about what it means to \u201csee\u201d or \u201cobserve\u201d the world around us, and grapple with the basic question of how we gain scientific knowledge at all. Topics include telescopes and microscopes, atomic theory, the unconscious and psychoanalysis, human consciousness and intelligence, dark matter, and the nature of objectivity. We will pay special attention to how scientists are trained to see in particular ways, and how culture and worldview can shape, restrict, or enhance the way we observe. Readings include Galileo, Ernst Mach, Henry Adams, Stephen J. Gould, Peter Galison, T.S. Kuhn, Freud, Edward Tufte.

The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine.   The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, esthetics, and indeed self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathematical descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embryonic stem cell research? How do machines shape esthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history?   This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellectual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine.            Program of Study          The minor in Science and Society requires four 4-point courses (16 points). All minors take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 94), and then choose three other courses from an approved list. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology ; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics ; and Nature and Technology in Modern America .   Students are also strongly encouraged to take courses in the various schools throughout NYU contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learning. CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the Minor in Science and Society must file a petition in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140.    NYU students from outside of CAS are welcome to declare a minor in Science and Society. Students should consult their home-school advisor for policies on their cross-school credit limit.            Required Course in CAS          HIST-UA 94 (4 points)   Introduction to Science &amp; Society  Introduces techniques and approaches used by the humanities and social sciences in studying science, technology, and medicine. Investigates how historians, philosophers, sociologists, and anthropologists apply their methodological toolkit in investigating scientific, technological, and medical knowledge. Invites students to think synthetically, organically, and creatively across several disciplines.
