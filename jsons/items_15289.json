I was very excited to land in London on September 4, 2012. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery. I flew red-eye and was greeted with a warm welcome from my host, a fellow London Business School MBA 2013 student. He gave me a tour of the school, and I got my photo taken for my ID. From the grin of my face in the photo, I was extremely happy to become a part of the LBS community.  London Business School has a small self-contained campus, but it happens to border one of London&rsquo;s largest and most beautiful parks, Regent&rsquo;s Park:  London pubs offer some of the tastiest ciders around. The cider (below) is an exotic combination of apple &amp; black current. Apparently, some ciders are seasonal, and the one pictured is a very popular summer cider:  I had about 2 weeks to spend travelling before school started, so I used this time to visit my family in Paris. Immediately after getting off the Eurostar, I was lifted into a gastronomic heaven and feasted on fois gras, escargot, steak tartare, French onion soup and a whole host of wines and cheeses during my stay:  Macarons are very popular in Paris &ndash; they are a staple on the McDonald&rsquo;s menu (below). Although these macarons may look as good as those offered in Parisian patisseries, they did not have the same consistency or taste.  From Paris, I travelled by train to Cannes, where I was greeted by fancy yachts and upscale shops. I felt a bit star-struck, and in the photo (below), I am beside Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s handprint:  Next, I travelled to Cinque Terre, &ldquo;The Five Lands,&rdquo; which comprises of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare. The beauty of Cinque Terre left me speechless.  There is an option to travel by boat, train or hike from one city to another. I travelled by boat to the furthest city, Monterroso al Mare and spent a day soaking up the sun on the beach. That evening, I walked the &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore&rdquo; (the Way of Love), a pedestrian street overlooking the sea, which links the villages of Riomaggiore and Manarola. This was an easy 25-minute walk on a paved road that offered some amazing costal views. On this route, young lovers, wanting to seal their love, write their names on the padlocks and attach them to wire mesh:  Thinking that all hikes would be as easy as the one from the day before, I decided to hike from Monterosso to Vernazza. I was not properly equipped for this hike, as it turned out to be a fairly strenuous 1.5-2 hour hike, with steep inclines. On this route, I also found some padlocks reminding me of &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore.&rdquo; As the hike drew to an end, I was greeted by Vernazza&rsquo;s colorful harbor:  I continued with my obsession of coastal towns and took the train down through southern Italy, where I explored Positano, Sorrento, Pompeii and Capri. Positano was also very beautiful; however, its landscape was marred by a recent drought, leaving much of the land arid:  I absolutely loved the coastal town of Sorrento, known for its sea cliffs and limoncello liqueur. I only had a few hours to spend here, but plan to re-visit in the near future:   Having spent several years devoted to the study of Latin scriptures, I was very excited to explore the ruins of Pompeii, a city destructed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79:  In the last leg of my journey, I took a boat to Capri, which offered spectacular views, wonderful hikes, high-end shops and delicious granite (ice-slush).   From Capri, I took a bus to Anacapri, which sits at a much higher elevation. At Anacapri, I took a chair lift, not uncommon to those offered at ski resorts, and soaked in its beauty:  I ended my trip with a glass of limoncello &ndash; it was a perfect ending to a wonderful vacation.

I also accomplished two long-time goals in September: learning to drive on the opposite side of the road, and touring Scotland.                  I\u2019ve been waiting for the opportunity to return to London for an extended stay since I moved back to New York at the age of nine. The chance to study at London Business School (LBS), a school that shares Stern\u2019s global approach and academic rigor, made this decision an easy one \u2013 so in late August I set out for the scepter\u2019d isle.    I\u2019ll be spending the term in a flat in Chelsea overlooking the River Thames. The sunset behind Battersea Bridge on my first night provided a warm welcome.       View of Battersea Bridge    I took full advantage of LBS\u2019s verdant lawns during breaks from the two intensive courses I completed in September.       London Business School Facade  Source: Wikimedia Commons    There\u2019s always something happening in London; a recent event was the Tall Ships Festival at Greenwich \u2013 of Greenwich-Mean-Time fame \u2013 just up the Thames. In addition to the impressive boats on display, the views from the Royal Observatory to Canary Wharf (one of London\u2019s financial hubs) were spectacular.       Tall Ships at Greenwich       Royal Naval College and Canary Wharf viewed from the Royal Observatory. Spot the tall ships in the middle distance.    I also accomplished two long-time goals in September: learning to drive on the opposite side of the road, and touring Scotland. The day after visiting Greenwich, I loaded up my backpack and hopped a train for Edinburgh.       The Royal Scotsman \u2013 sadly, not the train I rode.    Edinburgh is a wonderful city to visit \u2013 extremely welcoming, vibrant, and full of interesting things to see and do. Built on the site of an extinct volcano, it has a unique, hilly topography that encourages exploration. It was a particularly exciting time to be there, just days before the Scottish referendum on Independence.       \u201cYes\u201d campaign sign on The Royal Mile.    While in Edinburgh, I took a boat trip to Inchcolm, an island in the Firth of Forth which is home to both a remarkably well-preserved medieval abbey and a number of World War II-era fortifications.

I was very excited to land in London on September 4. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery.                  I was very excited to land in London on September 4, 2012. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery. I flew red-eye and was greeted with a warm welcome from my host, a fellow London Business School MBA 2013 student. He gave me a tour of the school, and I got my photo taken for my ID. From the grin of my face in the photo, I was extremely happy to become a part of the LBS community.  London Business School has a small self-contained campus, but it happens to border one of London&rsquo;s largest and most beautiful parks, Regent&rsquo;s Park:  London pubs offer some of the tastiest ciders around. The cider (below) is an exotic combination of apple &amp; black current. Apparently, some ciders are seasonal, and the one pictured is a very popular summer cider:  I had about 2 weeks to spend travelling before school started, so I used this time to visit my family in Paris. Immediately after getting off the Eurostar, I was lifted into a gastronomic heaven and feasted on fois gras, escargot, steak tartare, French onion soup and a whole host of wines and cheeses during my stay:  Macarons are very popular in Paris &ndash; they are a staple on the McDonald&rsquo;s menu (below). Although these macarons may look as good as those offered in Parisian patisseries, they did not have the same consistency or taste.  From Paris, I travelled by train to Cannes, where I was greeted by fancy yachts and upscale shops. I felt a bit star-struck, and in the photo (below), I am beside Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s handprint:  Next, I travelled to Cinque Terre, &ldquo;The Five Lands,&rdquo; which comprises of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare. The beauty of Cinque Terre left me speechless.  There is an option to travel by boat, train or hike from one city to another. I travelled by boat to the furthest city, Monterroso al Mare and spent a day soaking up the sun on the beach. That evening, I walked the &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore&rdquo; (the Way of Love), a pedestrian street overlooking the sea, which links the villages of Riomaggiore and Manarola. This was an easy 25-minute walk on a paved road that offered some amazing costal views. On this route, young lovers, wanting to seal their love, write their names on the padlocks and attach them to wire mesh:  Thinking that all hikes would be as easy as the one from the day before, I decided to hike from Monterosso to Vernazza. I was not properly equipped for this hike, as it turned out to be a fairly strenuous 1.5-2 hour hike, with steep inclines. On this route, I also found some padlocks reminding me of &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore.&rdquo; As the hike drew to an end, I was greeted by Vernazza&rsquo;s colorful harbor:  I continued with my obsession of coastal towns and took the train down through southern Italy, where I explored Positano, Sorrento, Pompeii and Capri. Positano was also very beautiful; however, its landscape was marred by a recent drought, leaving much of the land arid:  I absolutely loved the coastal town of Sorrento, known for its sea cliffs and limoncello liqueur. I only had a few hours to spend here, but plan to re-visit in the near future:   Having spent several years devoted to the study of Latin scriptures, I was very excited to explore the ruins of Pompeii, a city destructed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79:  In the last leg of my journey, I took a boat to Capri, which offered spectacular views, wonderful hikes, high-end shops and delicious granite (ice-slush).   From Capri, I took a bus to Anacapri, which sits at a much higher elevation. At Anacapri, I took a chair lift, not uncommon to those offered at ski resorts, and soaked in its beauty:  I ended my trip with a glass of limoncello &ndash; it was a perfect ending to a wonderful vacation. I am looking forward to my semester at LBS!

I also accomplished two long-time goals in September: learning to drive on the opposite side of the road, and touring Scotland.                  I\u2019ve been waiting for the opportunity to return to London for an extended stay since I moved back to New York at the age of nine. The chance to study at London Business School (LBS), a school that shares Stern\u2019s global approach and academic rigor, made this decision an easy one \u2013 so in late August I set out for the scepter\u2019d isle.    I\u2019ll be spending the term in a flat in Chelsea overlooking the River Thames. The sunset behind Battersea Bridge on my first night provided a warm welcome.       View of Battersea Bridge    I took full advantage of LBS\u2019s verdant lawns during breaks from the two intensive courses I completed in September.       London Business School Facade  Source: Wikimedia Commons    There\u2019s always something happening in London; a recent event was the Tall Ships Festival at Greenwich \u2013 of Greenwich-Mean-Time fame \u2013 just up the Thames. In addition to the impressive boats on display, the views from the Royal Observatory to Canary Wharf (one of London\u2019s financial hubs) were spectacular.       Tall Ships at Greenwich       Royal Naval College and Canary Wharf viewed from the Royal Observatory. Spot the tall ships in the middle distance.    I also accomplished two long-time goals in September: learning to drive on the opposite side of the road, and touring Scotland. The day after visiting Greenwich, I loaded up my backpack and hopped a train for Edinburgh.       The Royal Scotsman \u2013 sadly, not the train I rode.    Edinburgh is a wonderful city to visit \u2013 extremely welcoming, vibrant, and full of interesting things to see and do. Built on the site of an extinct volcano, it has a unique, hilly topography that encourages exploration. It was a particularly exciting time to be there, just days before the Scottish referendum on Independence.       \u201cYes\u201d campaign sign on The Royal Mile.    While in Edinburgh, I took a boat trip to Inchcolm, an island in the Firth of Forth which is home to both a remarkably well-preserved medieval abbey and a number of World War II-era fortifications.

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.
