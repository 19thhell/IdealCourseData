At NYU in Florence, you'll experience a different culture, acquire or improve your Italian language skills, while earning credit toward your major, minor, and general requirements.   Florence is a city where bankers, tradesmen, and religious people came together and sponsored and celebrated some of the great feats of human endeavor in the arts, architecture, music, sciences, and drawing.   New York University in Florence is located just north of the city center. Its 57 acres of tended grounds includes five historic and meticulously restored villas (for classrooms and student residences), outdoor recreation space, manicured formal gardens, and a vast olive grove allowing students to experience a comfortable and breathtaking home for the semester. The campus-like environment gives students a unique opportunity to experience a small campus environment while studying as a major American university.   Everyday Florence is a modern city with a strong Renaissance past. The Florentine population is multicultural, but the city\u2019s urban design is based on its medieval and renaissance history. The blend of a modern urban setting with an historic past makes Florence a unique study in contrasts which is at once energizing and inspiring. As a participant of NYU in Florence, you will have the opportunity to experience Florentine life like an insider. You won\u2019t want to miss the world renowned museums and historic landmarks while also exploring ordinary Italian life in the winding streets, tiny restaurants, and unique stores off the beaten path. Florence\u2019s location permits easy travel to other nearby cities: the beach at Cinque Terre, the leaning tower at Pisa, the famous town square in Siena, and many of the picturesque and charming Tuscan towns and villages that elude the short-term visitor.   Some of your classes will take you into the city\u2019s museums to study art first-hand, and some faculty members will provide as part of your course a behind-the-scenes tour of major historical locations (e.g. La Pergola, one of Europe\u2019s oldest opera houses). NYU also offers classes inside Villa La Pietra, an impressive mansion, dating back to the 15th century, home to one of Europe\u2019s first house museums. You\u2019ll study objects that elsewhere can only be seen behind glass, and have experts explore with you how the 21st century can benefit from some of the thoughts first developed in Florence.

Innovative, site-specific offerings in art history, history, literature and cinema are featured alongside a vibrant curriculum in sociology, politics and economics. These courses not only take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources provided by the city of Florence, and its strategic position within Italy and Europe, but also of a unique array of co-curricular lectures and activities that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly exchange and global policy discussions.   What can study abroad in Florence mean to students? An encounter with the city of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio; direct examination of world-famous masterpieces of art in the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Renaissance; to consider contemporary social issues at a campus where encounters for students with major European and American protagonists of world social and economic policy are a regular occurrence.   Throughout the year, students at NYU Florence benefit from the opportunity to participate directly in the high-level political, social and cultural policy dialogues organized on our campus. In previous years, we have hosted both Republican and Democrat presidential campaign managers, had a three-way dialogue with leading local Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders, and held a student-organized contemporary poetry slam. Through La Pietra Dialogues, interested students also have the opportunity to participate directly in the organization of the events that bring these outstanding figures to NYU Florence.   NYU Florence provides the atmosphere of a small college campus while studying abroad. An extremely low student to faculty ratio ensures small class size; many courses are organized partly or entirely as seminars. Our 57-acre estate, with olive groves and gardens, has five villas that provide a home to NYU Florence. These include Villa La Pietra with its house museum, and formal gardens. Students enjoy the opportunity to &quot;live&quot; Villa La Pietra during: visits to the collection; poetry readings, concerts, performances and lectures that take place inside or in the gardens of the villa               Learn     Courses   Special Programs   Freshman Program   Facilities   Faculty   Community Service                 Live     Housing &amp; Meals   Getting Around   Cost &amp; Budgeting   Language   Culture &amp; Customs   Safety   Health &amp; Wellness     Staff                 Explore     Restaurants   Nightlife   Things to do   Local Travel   Regional Travel   Shopping                                                                       Info for Parents                                                                                                Info for External Advisers                                                                                                Visit Other NYU Global Centers                                                      La Pietra Dialogues LPD convenes some of the world\u2019s foremost scholars, policy makers, practitioners, business leaders, public intellectuals and artists whose ideas and work have made a significant cultural or intellectual contribution to global society and the revival of the spirit of humanism for which Florence is known.

At NYU in Florence, you'll experience a different culture, acquire or improve your Italian language skills, while earning credit toward your major, minor, and general requirements.   Florence is a city where bankers, tradesmen, and religious people came together and sponsored and celebrated some of the great feats of human endeavor in the arts, architecture, music, sciences, and drawing.   New York University in Florence is located just north of the city center. Its 57 acres of tended grounds includes five historic and meticulously restored villas (for classrooms and student residences), outdoor recreation space, manicured formal gardens, and a vast olive grove allowing students to experience a comfortable and breathtaking home for the semester. The campus-like environment gives students a unique opportunity to experience a small campus environment while studying as a major American university.   Everyday Florence is a modern city with a strong Renaissance past. The Florentine population is multicultural, but the city\u2019s urban design is based on its medieval and renaissance history. The blend of a modern urban setting with an historic past makes Florence a unique study in contrasts which is at once energizing and inspiring. As a participant of NYU in Florence, you will have the opportunity to experience Florentine life like an insider. You won\u2019t want to miss the world renowned museums and historic landmarks while also exploring ordinary Italian life in the winding streets, tiny restaurants, and unique stores off the beaten path. Florence\u2019s location permits easy travel to other nearby cities: the beach at Cinque Terre, the leaning tower at Pisa, the famous town square in Siena, and many of the picturesque and charming Tuscan towns and villages that elude the short-term visitor.   Some of your classes will take you into the city\u2019s museums to study art first-hand, and some faculty members will provide as part of your course a behind-the-scenes tour of major historical locations (e.g. La Pergola, one of Europe\u2019s oldest opera houses). NYU also offers classes inside Villa La Pietra, an impressive mansion, dating back to the 15th century, home to one of Europe\u2019s first house museums. You\u2019ll study objects that elsewhere can only be seen behind glass, and have experts explore with you how the 21st century can benefit from some of the thoughts first developed in Florence.

Innovative, site-specific offerings in art history, history, literature and cinema are featured alongside a vibrant curriculum in sociology, politics and economics. These courses not only take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources provided by the city of Florence, and its strategic position within Italy and Europe, but also of a unique array of co-curricular lectures and activities that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly exchange and global policy discussions.   What can study abroad in Florence mean to students? An encounter with the city of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio; direct examination of world-famous masterpieces of art in the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Renaissance; to consider contemporary social issues at a campus where encounters for students with major European and American protagonists of world social and economic policy are a regular occurrence.   Throughout the year, students at NYU Florence benefit from the opportunity to participate directly in the high-level political, social and cultural policy dialogues organized on our campus. In previous years, we have hosted both Republican and Democrat presidential campaign managers, had a three-way dialogue with leading local Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders, and held a student-organized contemporary poetry slam. Through La Pietra Dialogues, interested students also have the opportunity to participate directly in the organization of the events that bring these outstanding figures to NYU Florence.   NYU Florence provides the atmosphere of a small college campus while studying abroad. An extremely low student to faculty ratio ensures small class size; many courses are organized partly or entirely as seminars.
