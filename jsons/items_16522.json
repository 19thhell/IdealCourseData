Since 1905 our physicians have pioneered a range of treatments that have improved the lives of people with musculoskeletal and neurological disorders. NYU Langone Medical Center and the Hospital for Joint Diseases (HJD) share a rich history, spanning HJD\u2019s academic affiliation with the NYU School of Medicine in 1986, its clinical association with NYU Langone Medical Center in 1994, the fusion of the two orthopaedic departments in 1997, and the integration of the rheumatology programs in 2001. On January 1, 2006, NYU Langone Medical Center and HJD merged, becoming the NYU Langone Medical Center\u2019s Hospital for Joint Diseases.
