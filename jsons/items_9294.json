Duke by the Philadelphia architect, Horace Trumbauer. In 1958, Mrs. James B. Duke and her daughter Miss Doris Duke donated the structure to New York University to house the Institute of Fine Arts. Architect Robert Venturi was charged with adapting the house for the Institute&rsquo;s use, which he did without altering its original architecture (for more information click here ).           The Institute has observed this anniversary with programs that explored the Duke House in the context of architecture, urbanism and the social history of New York. On February 1-2, 2013 we will mark the close of the centennial celebrations with the conference Duke House: A Case Study in Architecture, Decoration, and Art History . The conference will consider the IFA&rsquo;s presence at the Duke House by looking at the building &ndash; from its commissioning by the Dukes to its eventual transformation into an educational and research facility (Friday, February 1), as well as the work and influence of some of the professors who have been its inhabitants (Saturday, February 2) &ndash; Donald Hansen, Richard Krautheimer, Erwin Panofsky, and Kirk Varnedoe.

Duke by the Philadelphia architect, Horace Trumbauer. In 1958, Mrs. James B. Duke and her daughter Miss Doris Duke donated the structure to New York University to house the Institute of Fine Arts. Architect Robert Venturi was charged with adapting the house for the Institute&rsquo;s use, which he did without altering its original architecture (for more information click here ).           The Institute has observed this anniversary with programs that explored the Duke House in the context of architecture, urbanism and the social history of New York. On February 1-2, 2013 we will mark the close of the centennial celebrations with the conference Duke House: A Case Study in Architecture, Decoration, and Art History . The conference will consider the IFA&rsquo;s presence at the Duke House by looking at the building &ndash; from its commissioning by the Dukes to its eventual transformation into an educational and research facility (Friday, February 1), as well as the work and influence of some of the professors who have been its inhabitants (Saturday, February 2) &ndash; Donald Hansen, Richard Krautheimer, Erwin Panofsky, and Kirk Varnedoe.
