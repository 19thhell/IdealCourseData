Because it's filled with violence  So we like to go out dancing  And knock ourselves devoid of sense    Everybody kill kill kill  Everybody maim maim maim  Everybody slash thrash bash  Prove you have no brain    Who would up the killer children  We don't ask the girls to dance  We're afraid of independence  So we kick them in the pants  Who tied up the pounding puppets  Who the fuck wants boring music  This is not what we originally want  All we do now is abuse it    Anarchy is not roller derby  We must fight against the enemy  Whoever the fuck that might be   All we want is good clean fun!        FUNCTIONAL  Well I've been working hard  But it ain't coming now  Please won't you reach inside  And coax it out of me  Through all the seart and strain  Through manufactured pain  One night's commotion  Two day's devotion    When does the sexual  Become the functional  A tired piston  Goes through the system  When does the sexual  Become the frictional  The satisfactional  Become the functional    i've lived in locker rooms  I've lived in bedrooms  I've slept on dungeon floors  But they're just playrooms  Through all the sweat and strain...    Although all love is complex  It ends in herpes simplex  Avoid it like a bear trap  If you've got the reflex  Through all the sweat and strain...    When does the sexual become the  Functional, fictional, actual  Frictional, beneficial, attractional           BACK to False Prophets page     KILL FROM THE HEART Home"}]}]
