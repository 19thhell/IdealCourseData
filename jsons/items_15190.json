An anal fissure is a small tear or cut in the skin lining the anus which can    cause pain and/or bleeding.        Figure 1. A simple acute fissure, transanal view.    What Are The Symptons of An Anal Fissure?       The typical symptoms of an anal fissure are extreme pain during defecation and    red blood streaking the stool. Patients may try to avoid defecation because    of the pain.       What Causes An Anal Fissure?       A hard, dry bowel movement can cause a tear in the anal lining, resulting in    a fissure. Other causes of a fissure include diarrhea and inflammation of the    anorectal area.       Anal    fissures may be acute (recent onset) or chronic (present for a long time or    recurring frequently). An acute fissure is usually due to altered bowel habits    while a chronic fissure may be either due to poor bowel habits, overly tight    or spastic anal sphincter muscles, scarring or an underlying medical problem.    How Can A Fissure Be Treated?       An acute fissure is managed with non-operative treatments and over 90% will    heal without surgery. Bowel habits are improved with a high fiber diet, bulking    agents (fiber supplements), stool softeners, and plenty of fluids to avoid    constipation and promote the passage of soft stools. Warm baths for 10-20 minutes    several times each day are soothing and promote relaxation of the anal muscles.    Occasionally, special medicated creams may be recommended.       A chronic fissure (lasting greater than one month) may require additional treatment.    Depending on the appearance of the fissure, other medical problems such as    inflammatory bowel disease or infections may be considered and testing may    be recommended. A manometry test may be performed to determine if anal sphincter    pressures are high. An examination under anesthesia may be recommended to determine    if a definite reason exists for lack of healing.       What Can Be Done If A Fissure Doesn't Heal?       A fissure that fails to respond to treatment should be re-examined to determine    if a definitive reason exists for lack of healing. Such reasons can include    scarring or muscle spasm of the internal anal sphincter muscle. Those which    continue to cause pain and/or bleeding can be corrected by surgery.       What Does Surgery Involve?       Surgery usual consists of a small operation to cut a portion of the internal    anal sphincter muscle. This helps the fissure to heal by decreasing pain and    spasm. Cutting this muscle rarely interferes with the ability to control bowel    movements and can usually be performed without an overnight hospital stay.              Figure 2. A chronic fissure with a skin tag and a hypertrophied anal papilla,    coronal view.     How Long Does the Healing Process Take After Surgery?       Complete healing occurs in a few weeks, although pain often disappears after    a few days.       Will The Problem Return?       More than 90% of patients who require surgery for this problem have no further    trouble from fissures. If the problem returns without an obvious cause, the    person may need further assessment including anal manometry testing or an exam    under anesthesia.       Can Fissures Lead to Colon Cancer?       No! Persistent symptoms need careful evaluation, however, since conditions    other than fissure can cause similar symptoms.

Cancer describes a set of diseases in which normal cells       in the body, through a series of genetic changes, lose the ability       to control their growth and to respect their neighbors. As cancers       grow, they invade the tissues around them (local invasion).       They may also spread to other locations in the body via the       blood vessels or lymphatic channels where they may implant and       grow (metastases). Tumors, or growths in the body, may be benign       or malignant (cancerous). When they are benign they may grow       but they do not spread to other locations. Malignant tumors       have the ability to invade deeply and to spread (metastasize).      Anal cancer arises from the cells around the anal opening (verge) or within the  anal canal (1-2 inches long) up to its junction with the rectum. Most anal cancers  arise from skin cells and are called squamous cell carcinomas. Some arise from the  special mucosal cells lining the upper anal canal and are called cloacogenic carcinomas.  Although several other types of cancer may occur in this area, these two are the  most common. They behave similarly and are treated in the same fashion. Cells that  are becoming malignant but have not invaded below the surface are \"pre-cancerous\" (carcinoma-in-situ).  This condition is called Bowen's disease.       How Common IS Anal Cancer?      Anal cancer is fairly uncommon. It accounts for about 1-2% of gastrointestinal  cancers. About 3,400 new cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S.A.,  and about 500 people will die of the disease each year. This may be compared to  140,000 new cases of colorectal cancer with 50,000 deaths per year.      Who Is At Risk?      We do not know the exact cause of most anal cancers. But we do know that certain  risk factors are linked to anal cancer. A risk factor is something that increases  a person's chance of getting a disease.                     Age - Most people with anal cancer are over 50 years old.       Anal warts - Infection with the human papilloma virus      (HPV) which causes condyloma (warts) may increase the chance of      developing anal cancer.   Anal sex - Persons who participate in anal sex are at an increased risk.   Smoking - Harmful chemicals from smoking increase the risk of most cancers including anal cancer.   Immunosuppression - People with weakened immune systems, such as transplant patients who must take drugs to suppress their immune systems and patients with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, are at a somewhat higher risk.   Chronic local inflammation - People with long-standing anal fistulas or open wounds are at a slightly higher risk.   Pelvic radiation - People who have had pelvic radiation therapy for rectal, prostate, bladder or cervical cancer are at an increased risk.           Can Anal Cancer Be Prevented?             Few cancers can be totally prevented but your risk may be decreased      significantly by reducing your risk factors and by getting regular      checkups. Avoid anal sex and infection with HPV and HIV. Use condoms      whenever having any kind of intercourse. Although condoms do not      eliminate the risk of infection, they do reduce it. Stopping smoking      lowers the risk of many types of cancer, including anal cancer.     What Are The Symptoms Of Anal Cancer?    Many cases of anal cancer can be found early. Anal cancers form in a part of the digestive tract that the doctor can see and reach easily. Anal cancers often cause symptoms such as:      Bleeding from the rectum or anus   The feeling of a lump or mass at the anal opening   Pain in the anal area   Persistent or recurrent itching   Change in bowel habits (having more or fewer bowel movements) or increased straining during a bowel movement   Narrowing of the stools   Discharge (mucous or pus) from the anus   Swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the anal or groin areas.    These symptoms can also be caused by less serious conditions such as hemorrhoids but you should never assume this. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor.     How Is Anal Cancer Diagnosed?    Finding cancers early is the key to cure. Regular checkups with a digital (finger) exam of the rectum and anus will find many problems which are easy to treat when found early. Routine screening for colorectal and anal cancer in people without any symptoms includes a digital rectal exam and test for blood in the stool yearly and a flexible endoscopy exam (lighted probe) every 5-10 years starting at 50 years of age.    If anal cancer is suspected based on your doctor's exam, a biopsy will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, additional tests to determine the extent of the cancer may be recommended.     How Are Anal Cancers Treated?    Treatment for most cases of anal cancer is very effective. There are 3 basic types of treatment used for anal cancer:    surgery - an operation to remove the cancer   radiation therapy - high-dose x-rays to kill cancer cells   chemotherapy - giving drugs to kill cancer cells.     I including radiation therapy and chemotherapy is now considered the standard  treatment for most anal cancers. Occasionally a very small or early tumor may be  removed surgically ( local excision ), with minimal damage to the anal sphincter  muscles.       Will I Need A Colostomy?      The majority of patients treated for anal cancer will not need a colostomy. If  the tumor does not respond completely to combination therapy, if it recurs after  treatment, or if it is an unusual type, an abdomino-perineal resection (APR) removal  of the rectum and anus and creation of a colostomy may be necessary.       What Happens After Treatment For Anal Cancer?      Follow-up care to assess the results of treatment and to check for recurrence  is very important. Most anal carcinomas are effectively treated. In addition, many  tumors that recur may be successfully treated if they are caught early. A careful  examination by an experienced physician at regular intervals is the most important  method of follow-up. Additional studies may be recommended. You should report any  symptoms or problems to your doctor right away.       Conclusion      Anal cancers are unusual tumors arising from the skin or mucosa of the anal canal.  As with most cancers, early detection is associated with excellent survival. Most  tumors are well treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation. Recurrences  may often be treated successfully. Follow the recommended screening examinations  for anal and colorectal cancer and consult your doctor early when any anorectal  symptoms occur.

A fissure that fails to respond to treatment should be re-examined to determine    if a definitive reason exists for lack of healing. Such reasons can include    scarring or muscle spasm of the internal anal sphincter muscle. Those which    continue to cause pain and/or bleeding can be corrected by surgery.       What Does Surgery Involve?       Surgery usual consists of a small operation to cut a portion of the internal    anal sphincter muscle. This helps the fissure to heal by decreasing pain and    spasm. Cutting this muscle rarely interferes with the ability to control bowel    movements and can usually be performed without an overnight hospital stay.              Figure 2.

Complete healing occurs in a few weeks, although pain often disappears after    a few days.       Will The Problem Return?       More than 90% of patients who require surgery for this problem have no further    trouble from fissures. If the problem returns without an obvious cause, the    person may need further assessment including anal manometry testing or an exam    under anesthesia.       Can Fissures Lead to Colon Cancer?       No! Persistent symptoms need careful evaluation, however, since conditions    other than fissure can cause similar symptoms.

Cancer describes a set of diseases in which normal cells       in the body, through a series of genetic changes, lose the ability       to control their growth and to respect their neighbors. As cancers       grow, they invade the tissues around them (local invasion).       They may also spread to other locations in the body via the       blood vessels or lymphatic channels where they may implant and       grow (metastases). Tumors, or growths in the body, may be benign       or malignant (cancerous). When they are benign they may grow       but they do not spread to other locations. Malignant tumors       have the ability to invade deeply and to spread (metastasize).      Anal cancer arises from the cells around the anal opening (verge) or within the  anal canal (1-2 inches long) up to its junction with the rectum. Most anal cancers  arise from skin cells and are called squamous cell carcinomas. Some arise from the  special mucosal cells lining the upper anal canal and are called cloacogenic carcinomas.  Although several other types of cancer may occur in this area, these two are the  most common. They behave similarly and are treated in the same fashion. Cells that  are becoming malignant but have not invaded below the surface are \"pre-cancerous\" (carcinoma-in-situ).  This condition is called Bowen's disease.       How Common IS Anal Cancer?      Anal cancer is fairly uncommon. It accounts for about 1-2% of gastrointestinal  cancers. About 3,400 new cases of anal cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S.A.,  and about 500 people will die of the disease each year. This may be compared to  140,000 new cases of colorectal cancer with 50,000 deaths per year.      Who Is At Risk?      We do not know the exact cause of most anal cancers. But we do know that certain  risk factors are linked to anal cancer. A risk factor is something that increases  a person's chance of getting a disease.                     Age - Most people with anal cancer are over 50 years old.       Anal warts - Infection with the human papilloma virus      (HPV) which causes condyloma (warts) may increase the chance of      developing anal cancer.   Anal sex - Persons who participate in anal sex are at an increased risk.   Smoking - Harmful chemicals from smoking increase the risk of most cancers including anal cancer.   Immunosuppression - People with weakened immune systems, such as transplant patients who must take drugs to suppress their immune systems and patients with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection, are at a somewhat higher risk.   Chronic local inflammation - People with long-standing anal fistulas or open wounds are at a slightly higher risk.   Pelvic radiation - People who have had pelvic radiation therapy for rectal, prostate, bladder or cervical cancer are at an increased risk.           Can Anal Cancer Be Prevented?             Few cancers can be totally prevented but your risk may be decreased      significantly by reducing your risk factors and by getting regular      checkups. Avoid anal sex and infection with HPV and HIV. Use condoms      whenever having any kind of intercourse. Although condoms do not      eliminate the risk of infection, they do reduce it. Stopping smoking      lowers the risk of many types of cancer, including anal cancer.     What Are The Symptoms Of Anal Cancer?    Many cases of anal cancer can be found early. Anal cancers form in a part of the digestive tract that the doctor can see and reach easily. Anal cancers often cause symptoms such as:      Bleeding from the rectum or anus   The feeling of a lump or mass at the anal opening   Pain in the anal area   Persistent or recurrent itching   Change in bowel habits (having more or fewer bowel movements) or increased straining during a bowel movement   Narrowing of the stools   Discharge (mucous or pus) from the anus   Swollen lymph nodes (glands) in the anal or groin areas.    These symptoms can also be caused by less serious conditions such as hemorrhoids but you should never assume this. If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor.     How Is Anal Cancer Diagnosed?    Finding cancers early is the key to cure. Regular checkups with a digital (finger) exam of the rectum and anus will find many problems which are easy to treat when found early. Routine screening for colorectal and anal cancer in people without any symptoms includes a digital rectal exam and test for blood in the stool yearly and a flexible endoscopy exam (lighted probe) every 5-10 years starting at 50 years of age.    If anal cancer is suspected based on your doctor's exam, a biopsy will be performed to confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis of cancer is confirmed, additional tests to determine the extent of the cancer may be recommended.     How Are Anal Cancers Treated?    Treatment for most cases of anal cancer is very effective. There are 3 basic types of treatment used for anal cancer:    surgery - an operation to remove the cancer   radiation therapy - high-dose x-rays to kill cancer cells   chemotherapy - giving drugs to kill cancer cells.     I including radiation therapy and chemotherapy is now considered the standard  treatment for most anal cancers. Occasionally a very small or early tumor may be  removed surgically ( local excision ), with minimal damage to the anal sphincter  muscles.       Will I Need A Colostomy?      The majority of patients treated for anal cancer will not need a colostomy. If  the tumor does not respond completely to combination therapy, if it recurs after  treatment, or if it is an unusual type, an abdomino-perineal resection (APR) removal  of the rectum and anus and creation of a colostomy may be necessary.       What Happens After Treatment For Anal Cancer?      Follow-up care to assess the results of treatment and to check for recurrence  is very important. Most anal carcinomas are effectively treated. In addition, many  tumors that recur may be successfully treated if they are caught early. A careful  examination by an experienced physician at regular intervals is the most important  method of follow-up. Additional studies may be recommended. You should report any  symptoms or problems to your doctor right away.       Conclusion      Anal cancers are unusual tumors arising from the skin or mucosa of the anal canal.  As with most cancers, early detection is associated with excellent survival. Most  tumors are well treated with combination chemotherapy and radiation. Recurrences  may often be treated successfully. Follow the recommended screening examinations  for anal and colorectal cancer and consult your doctor early when any anorectal  symptoms occur.
