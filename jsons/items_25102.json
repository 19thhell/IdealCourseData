Living in NYU Paris assigned housing is a condition of enrollment. All students will complete an online housing application where they will express their interest in the type of housing assignment that is preferred. Housing assignments will be made based on availability of each housing type and may take into consideration if the student is enrolled in the Program II (Francophone) coursework or not. Keep in mind that assignments may not be the top preference but a placement in NYU approved housing is guaranteed. Housing options include:     Residence Montsouris     Homestays   Apartments                                           Housing Assignments            Online Housing Application   During the pre-departure process the NYU Paris adviser will direct you to an online housing application. The application will allow you to submit your preference for an assignment in the type of housing that is available. NYU Paris housing staff will review your responses to questions from the application, consider your program of study, and also the availability of styles of housing before making assignments.   Placement   Once housing assignments are finalized, typically about two weeks before arrival in Paris, NYU Paris will inform students via email of their assignment.   Housing Check-in and Payment   Residence Montsouris or R\u00e9publique Apartments: If you are assigned to live in the Montsouris student residence, or in the R\u00e9publique apartments, you will be instructed to go directly to the building from the airport to check in. Housing charges will appear on the NYU Bursar bill in US dollars. Scholarships and aid awards in excess of tuition and fees will credit against the cost of housing. Payments are to be made to the University Bursar in the e-suite online payment tool.   Homestay or Privately Owned Apartment: If you are assigned to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment, you will be informed of an address of a hotel where you should proceed from the airport. The cost of the hotel is paid for by NYU on your behalf. Within a few days of your arrival, you will meet individually with a member of the NYU Paris staff to receive the exact address of your housing assignment. You will be given an appointment to meet your French host or to see your apartment. This assignment is final and cannot be changed. (Note: housing details will NOT be communicated to students before this occasion). Before moving in, you will be required to complete a written agreement with your landlord concerning rent, utilities, security deposit, payment methods accepted by your landlord, and the length of your stay.   Note regarding security deposits: In accordance with French law, you will be required upon move-in to give a security deposit equivalent to one month\u2019s rent and the first month's rent in its entirety. Please plan to have access to this amount of funds upon arrival. Note: French bank accounts will not yet be available when you move in. You will be advised as to how to exchange traveler's checks during orientation.                NYU Paris Housing FAQ's:       Students who live in the Montsouris residence will live with other students enrolled at NYU Paris, have kitchen and bathroom facilities in the room, and will receive support from live-in NYU student resident assistants. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.&amp;nbsp;   The R\u00e9publique building offers single studios to NYU students but the majority of residents are local French or international students enrolled in the French university system. The apartments have equipped kitchenettes and bathrooms. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.     Students who live in homestays and privately owned apartments must understand that NYU does not control these units. Rather, NYU Paris puts students in contact with independent Parisian landlords, and hosts whom have rented to NYU students in the past and are willing to rent their apartments or rooms on a short-term basis. NYU Paris has no financial relationship with landlords/home owners. NYU Paris receives no financial gain in exchange.   The NYU Paris housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between the residence manager, property owners, and students. All accommodations have been visited and approved by NYU Paris staff.   Homestays and privately owned apartments are located in neighborhoods in all twenty arrondissements of Paris and its immediate suburbs. Average commute time from these student housing types to the NYU Paris academic center and Parisian universities ranges from 30 to 50 minutes.   There is no &quot;average&quot; room. Every apartment, homestay, etc. differs in size and prices range from $600 to $1,400 or more per student per month.   According to French law, rent for all months in which a unit is occupied is due in its entirety and landlords may legally keep security deposits for up to two months after the student vacates the housing. The charge for living in Montsouris or the R\u00e9publique apartments is constant for fall and spring semester, whereas the cost to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment is greater in the spring semester due to the extra length of the spring semester academic calendar.

The University of Paris   Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne was founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, and is one of the oldest universities in Europe. In 1808 the Sorbonne expanded to become the University of Paris. In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities with separate locations around Paris.

In the new location, students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural, artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood, as well as to get to know the city through faculty-led visits and walking tours. The program offers regular day trips to places outside of the city, such as Chantilly, Giverny, and Versailles, and weekend excursions to locations that have included Avignon, the Loire Valley, Mont-Saint-Michel, and La Rochelle. These trips allow students to further embrace the richness, depth, and diversity of French history and civilization.

Living in NYU Paris assigned housing is a condition of enrollment. All students will complete an online housing application where they will express their interest in the type of housing assignment that is preferred. Housing assignments will be made based on availability of each housing type and may take into consideration if the student is enrolled in the Program II (Francophone) coursework or not. Keep in mind that assignments may not be the top preference but a placement in NYU approved housing is guaranteed. Housing options include:     Residence Montsouris     Homestays   Apartments                                           Housing Assignments            Online Housing Application   During the pre-departure process the NYU Paris adviser will direct you to an online housing application. The application will allow you to submit your preference for an assignment in the type of housing that is available. NYU Paris housing staff will review your responses to questions from the application, consider your program of study, and also the availability of styles of housing before making assignments.   Placement   Once housing assignments are finalized, typically about two weeks before arrival in Paris, NYU Paris will inform students via email of their assignment.   Housing Check-in and Payment   Residence Montsouris or R\u00e9publique Apartments: If you are assigned to live in the Montsouris student residence, or in the R\u00e9publique apartments, you will be instructed to go directly to the building from the airport to check in. Housing charges will appear on the NYU Bursar bill in US dollars. Scholarships and aid awards in excess of tuition and fees will credit against the cost of housing. Payments are to be made to the University Bursar in the e-suite online payment tool.   Homestay or Privately Owned Apartment: If you are assigned to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment, you will be informed of an address of a hotel where you should proceed from the airport. The cost of the hotel is paid for by NYU on your behalf. Within a few days of your arrival, you will meet individually with a member of the NYU Paris staff to receive the exact address of your housing assignment. You will be given an appointment to meet your French host or to see your apartment. This assignment is final and cannot be changed. (Note: housing details will NOT be communicated to students before this occasion). Before moving in, you will be required to complete a written agreement with your landlord concerning rent, utilities, security deposit, payment methods accepted by your landlord, and the length of your stay.   Note regarding security deposits: In accordance with French law, you will be required upon move-in to give a security deposit equivalent to one month\u2019s rent and the first month's rent in its entirety. Please plan to have access to this amount of funds upon arrival. Note: French bank accounts will not yet be available when you move in. You will be advised as to how to exchange traveler's checks during orientation.                NYU Paris Housing FAQ's:       Students who live in the Montsouris residence will live with other students enrolled at NYU Paris, have kitchen and bathroom facilities in the room, and will receive support from live-in NYU student resident assistants. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.&amp;nbsp;   The R\u00e9publique building offers single studios to NYU students but the majority of residents are local French or international students enrolled in the French university system. The apartments have equipped kitchenettes and bathrooms. NYU graduate and undergraduate students serve as resident assistants.     Students who live in homestays and privately owned apartments must understand that NYU does not control these units. Rather, NYU Paris puts students in contact with independent Parisian landlords, and hosts whom have rented to NYU students in the past and are willing to rent their apartments or rooms on a short-term basis. NYU Paris has no financial relationship with landlords/home owners. NYU Paris receives no financial gain in exchange.   The NYU Paris housing coordinator serves as an intermediary between the residence manager, property owners, and students. All accommodations have been visited and approved by NYU Paris staff.   Homestays and privately owned apartments are located in neighborhoods in all twenty arrondissements of Paris and its immediate suburbs. Average commute time from these student housing types to the NYU Paris academic center and Parisian universities ranges from 30 to 50 minutes.   There is no &quot;average&quot; room. Every apartment, homestay, etc. differs in size and prices range from $600 to $1,400 or more per student per month.   According to French law, rent for all months in which a unit is occupied is due in its entirety and landlords may legally keep security deposits for up to two months after the student vacates the housing. The charge for living in Montsouris or the R\u00e9publique apartments is constant for fall and spring semester, whereas the cost to live in a homestay or a privately owned apartment is greater in the spring semester due to the extra length of the spring semester academic calendar.

The University of Paris   Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne was founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, and is one of the oldest universities in Europe. In 1808 the Sorbonne expanded to become the University of Paris. In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities with separate locations around Paris. Since that division, the system has grown to include 13 different university complexes throughout the city and beyond. The original Sorbonne, located in the Latin Quarter, has become a complex of buildings serving the needs of these universities.
