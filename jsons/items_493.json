The simulations are based on mathematical models,   numerical methods, and Matlab programming techniques that will   be taught in class. The use of animations (and sound where   appropriate) to present the results of simulations will be   emphasized.

Cannot apply both Calculus courses and Math for Economics   courses towards your major.     This course is only open to Economics Majors and prospective    majors. If an Economics Major decides to double or joint major    in Math these courses will replace Calculus I - III, along    with Math for Economics III.     To be offered in fall 2011 and spring 2012 and every fall    and spring thereafter. Elements of calculus and linear algebra    are important to the study of economics.
