For additional information visit the Italian Studies Department .   NYU London   Sponsored by the Urban Design and Architecture Studies program of the Art History Department the M.A. program in Historical and Sustainable Architecture is offered in conjunction with The Sir John Soane Museum, the program operates within the framework of NYU London. In an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable --and profitable. This program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research with experiential learning opportunities.   For additional information visit the Art History Department .   NYU Madrid   The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers unique one-year graduate program leading to an M.A. in with a concentration in either Spanish and Latin American Literatures, or Spanish Language and Translation . Students are admitted to enroll at NYU Madrid for the academic year with courses taught by distinguished NYU and Spanish university faculty, poets, writers, and filmmakers.   For detailed information visit the Department of Spanish and Portuguese .   NYU Paris   The Department of French offers five distinct programs at NYU Paris. The Master of Arts degree in French Literature is a one year program which culminates in the successful completion of the Master\u2019s exam. The Master of Arts degree in French Language and Civilization is offered as a one year program or as a summers only program (courses are completed over the course of three or four consecutive summers) and concludes with a Master\u2019s essay. Our new collaborative two-year dual degree program combines the MA in French Language and Civilization and Advanced Certificate in Museum Studies . Students will spend their first year in Paris and the second in New York. This two-year, 48 credit interdisciplinary program, is open to students interested in developing expertise in French culture and society along with the theory and practice of museum work in two of the greatest museum cities of the world: Paris and New York. The fourth degree in Teaching French as a Foreign Language is a joint degree in conjunction with the Department of Teaching and Learning of the Steinhardt Graduate School of Education, leading to New York State initial certification as a teacher of French for grades 7\u201312. The M.A. in TFFL is a two-year degree program, with the first year spent in Paris, and the second year at the Steinhardt School in New York. Students interested in creative writing may pursue the MFA Writers Workshop in Paris. Over two years, students and faculty convene regularly in Paris for five intensive ten-day residency periods (held biannually in January and July). While in residency students participate in a vibrant community engaged in workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, a diverse series of readings, special events and professional development panels.

NYU London   Sponsored by the Urban Design and Architecture Studies program of the Art History Department the M.A. program in Historical and Sustainable Architecture is offered in conjunction with The Sir John Soane Museum, the program operates within the framework of NYU London. In an era when the demolition of older buildings has been recognized, not just as a loss to the urban fabric but also as a major source of environmental pollution, retaining historic structures and using them for new purposes is increasingly desirable --and profitable. This program explores innovative ways to reconcile real estate development with historical preservation and environmental protection by recycling existing structures. The course of study combines academic training and research with experiential learning opportunities.   For additional information visit the Art History Department .   NYU Madrid   The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers unique one-year graduate program leading to an M.A. in with a concentration in either Spanish and Latin American Literatures, or Spanish Language and Translation .

The Master of Arts degree in French Literature is a one year program which culminates in the successful completion of the Master\u2019s exam. The Master of Arts degree in French Language and Civilization is offered as a one year program or as a summers only program (courses are completed over the course of three or four consecutive summers) and concludes with a Master\u2019s essay. Our new collaborative two-year dual degree program combines the MA in French Language and Civilization and Advanced Certificate in Museum Studies . Students will spend their first year in Paris and the second in New York. This two-year, 48 credit interdisciplinary program, is open to students interested in developing expertise in French culture and society along with the theory and practice of museum work in two of the greatest museum cities of the world: Paris and New York. The fourth degree in Teaching French as a Foreign Language is a joint degree in conjunction with the Department of Teaching and Learning of the Steinhardt Graduate School of Education, leading to New York State initial certification as a teacher of French for grades 7\u201312. The M.A. in TFFL is a two-year degree program, with the first year spent in Paris, and the second year at the Steinhardt School in New York. Students interested in creative writing may pursue the MFA Writers Workshop in Paris. Over two years, students and faculty convene regularly in Paris for five intensive ten-day residency periods (held biannually in January and July). While in residency students participate in a vibrant community engaged in workshops, craft talks, lectures, individual conferences and manuscript consultations, a diverse series of readings, special events and professional development panels.
