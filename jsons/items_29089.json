Dolan Music Recording Studio and 6th Floor Spaces                        Photos by Cheryl Fleming Photography The brand new James Dolan Music Recording Studio is a 7,500 square foot multifunctional teaching, recording, and research space designed by Gensler and the Walters-Storyk Design Group. One of the most technologically advanced audio teaching facilities in the United States, the new facility greatly enhances the existing 12 studios which house the Music Technology program of NYU&rsquo;s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. The studio is located on the sixth floor of 35 West 4th Street. To see pictures, click here .    The new complex is distinguished by a 25-seat control/classroom which features a fully automated 48 channel SSL console and the first Dangerous Music 10.2 surround installation in New York City. In addition to a live room large enough to accommodate a small orchestra, the floor includes several research laboratories, offices, a conference/seminar room and a large iso/drum booth. Multiple windows and a full line of sight provide natural light throughout. A unique research lab dedicated to 3D audio experimentation is equipped with an innovative, reconfigurable grid outfitted with sixteen Genelec speakers, two Genelec subs and multi-channel micing, tracking and playback options. The lab also boasts extremely low (.2 second) reverb time. Since its opening, the new studio has been featured in many online publications. Below is a partial list of recent press coverage.
