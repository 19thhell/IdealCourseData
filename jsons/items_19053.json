Typically, a student taking a CORE production is involved in every aspect of creating a project - the scriptwriting, producing, directing, shooting, and editing. (A \"Craft\" course, by comparison, concentrates on only one aspect of the project creation as just the directing, just the producing, just the editing, etc.)    All courses are arranged by subject areas and by level: Introductory, Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advanced. Some courses may not be offered in a given academic year. Consult each semester\u2019s schedule for specific information.    Students must complete 4 Core Production courses for a minimum of 20 points. However, only one CORE production course may be taken each semester due to the strenuous nature of these courses.

The Film Production Fund may provide production grants to student projects. Student producers and directors solicit funds for their productions as tax deductible donations to the University. This is done by carefully observing the guidelines listed below.    Rules Governing Fundraising and the Production Fund       You must understand, and your donor should be advised, that your fundraising effort is necessarily characterized by an all for one, one for all spirit on behalf of all students here, in which there is no obligation on the part of the school to restrictively award the proceeds of your effort directly to you or your project. This does not preclude your donor noting special interest in your project, as accounted for in the transmittal letter.       All contributions must be accompanied by the transmittal letter.       No donations should be solicited from family members or close family friends. No relative of the director or of any crew member may make a donation to a specific film project through the Production Fund. The tax-deductible gift status cannot be granted in such situations.       You must be a TSOA Film/TV major and you must be matriculated. The only exception to the requirement of matriculation is if you graduate. The Fund is available for use for three months from the date of graduation. Any money received by or remaining in the Fund after you graduate is forfeited to the Fund three months from that date.       You must obtain written approval from your production instructor, addressed to Mr. Derrick Bethune, before embarking on your fund raising activities. These activities must be on behalf of a particular project in that instructors class. No outside unofficial projects may solicit funds.       Aggregate donations must total at least $500 for your project to be eligible for a potential production grant from the Film Production Fund. Please allow at least 2 weeks for the processing of the donation check.       Once a donation has been solicited and submitted to the Department of Film and Television Budget Office, it is the students responsibility to notify that office when he/she wishes to have a production grant check processed. It will take four weeks from the time a donation is submitted until the money may be received. It requires two weeks from the time the check is received by the Budget Office until it may be requested as grant money, and it requires an additional two weeks until a check from that money may be issued by the University.       Once in receipt of monies from The Film Production Fund, the student is strongly advised to retain all appropriate receipts against your allotment.       Each production will receive no more than 80% of the contributed funds. The remaining 20% will be used for Departmental Post-Production Awards.
