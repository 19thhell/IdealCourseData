These programs are online adaptations of curriculum developed and currently offered by the NYU-SCPS Paul McGhee Division, the University\u2019s esteemed undergraduate program specifically for adult students.   Adults who have completed at least 40 to 64 credits at a regionally-accredited university may be eligible for admission. Applications to the fall 2009 semester are being accepted this summer.   Offered through NYU-SCPS Online, students will access the same courses, faculty, and student resources (including the NYU library, academic advisement, and the like) as those attending in-person classes. NYU-SCPS Online also delivers the School\u2019s online master\u2019s degree programs in Management and Systems and Human Resource Management and Technology and several non-credit programs in business, writing, and other subjects.   The McGhee online courses maximize student-to-faculty and student-to-student interactions with a variety of communications and technological tools. Further, explains Kinsey, the online classes use the same proven educational tools used in McGhee\u2019s on-site courses\u2014such as team projects, research papers, and peer-to-peer learning\u2014to create a rich learning environment.
