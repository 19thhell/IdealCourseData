Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh,      by contrast, strove for greater emotional and symbolic content in      their paintings. Both artists viewed the city as alienating rather      than utopian. They each sought creative inspiration in the pre-      industrial world, Van Gogh in the South of France and Gauguin in      Brittany and Tahiti.

The Neoclassical paintings of Jacques-Louis David,      for instance, are characterized by their exceptional clarity and      order and their frieze-like compositions, which recall ancient relief      sculpture and even Greek vase painting.

Both Neoclassicism and Romanticism coincided with the democratic      movements of the late 1770s, and both artistic styles placed value      on emotional content and the idea of \"natural man\". While Neoclassicism      celebrated heroism in service of the State and human reason and      rationality, Romanticism emphasized imagination, intuition, and      the extremes of subjective experience. The Romantic movement fostered      the emergence of the modern idea of the artist as anti-authoritarian      rebel genius. Romantic works depict a range of human emotions from      joy and awe to terror and agony, and artists like Gericault and      Turner expressed moral outrage over contemporary events in history      paintings and landscape.      Realist artists also responded to contemporary events, but instead      of painting from the imagination, they presented the subject matter      of everyday life scenes that they observed and restaged  on a      grand scale formerly reserved for history painting. The consummate      Realist painter in mid-nineteenth-century France, Gustave Courbet      painted unsentimental canvasses that featured the provincial citizens      of his native Ornans in works like Burial at Ornans and Young Ladies      of the Village. Edouard Manet scandalized both the critics and public      with works that flouted middle class morality (Le Djeuner sur l'Herbe;      Olympia). Manet's use of broad areas of flat color with little shading      or modeling (the \"color patch\") reasserted the two-dimensionality      of painting on canvas and influenced the work of the Impressionists.           Building on the achievements of Realist artists, the Impressionists      painted scenes of modern life and middle class leisure in and around      Paris. They often painted directly from nature, creating canvasses      \"en plein air,\" or out-of-doors, in front of the urban or suburban      landscape. They attempted to capture the transitory and ephemeral      character of the modern city and landscape, with special attention      to the effects of light and optical theory, as is especially clear      in the serial paintings of Claude Monet. Impressionist canvasses      reject traditional means of illusionism such as linear perspective,      foreshortening, contour shading and modeling. Instead of creating      the illusion of depth, the Impressionists reinforced the flatness      of the canvas through the build-up of individual brushstrokes of      pure, unblended color (optical color mixture).      The Post-Impressionists emerged as critics of the seeming lack      of structure and symbolic content in Impressionist painting. They      rejected the Impressionists' goal of capturing the momentary and      sought to convey the permanent, but they remained indebted to the      Impressionists' individualized brushstrokes and liberated color.      Paul  Cezanne and Georges Seurat took a more intellectual approach      to painting. While Seurat utilized color theory and the Divisionist      style to depict scenes of Parisian nightlife and outdoor leisure,      Cezanne used cubic, \"axe-cut\" brushstrokes, geometricized forms,      and pure color to reinterpret the \"grand\" themes of Western painting      such as landscape and still life. Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh,      by contrast, strove for greater emotional and symbolic content in      their paintings. Both artists viewed the city as alienating rather      than utopian. They each sought creative inspiration in the pre-      industrial world, Van Gogh in the South of France and Gauguin in      Brittany and Tahiti. While both artists employ anti-naturalistic      colors, Van Gogh's compositions also rely for expressive effect      on his characteristic gestural brushstroke and impasto surface.
