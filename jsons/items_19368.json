The program has 3 separate, entry-level pathways to accommodate students entering with a bachelor&#39;s degree in any of the following disciplines:     Chemical engineering   Mechanical engineering   Electrical engineering   Computer science engineering   Physics   Chemistry   Biology   Premedical studies     Accommodating students with a variety of academic backgrounds is in keeping with the interdisciplinary nature of biomedical engineering.    Advanced PhD BME students select one from the following 2 thesis tracks:     Biomaterials and Polymer Therapeutics | track description   Bioimaging and Neuroengineering | track description     Additional tracks may be added in the future. In the event that a student wishes to transfer between tracks during the first 2 years of the program, the Program Director will review the student&#39;s request.    The required PhD thesis research may be conducted under the supervision of a faculty member from either the School of Engineering or SUNY Downstate. It is expected that these students need 6 years after their bachelor&#39;s degree to complete the doctoral program.    Students are required to complete 2 laboratory rotations, each of 3 to 4 months&#39; duration, prior to selection of a thesis laboratory. In keeping with the goal of preparing graduates for the changing career marketplace, it is recommended that 1 rotation be in an industrial setting; the other should be in an academic setting, i.e., in a basic science laboratory of either the School of Engineering or Downstate, or in a laboratory of a Downstate clinical department engaged in translational research.    Both types of settings provide mentor-based, individualized training of the highest quality. Both basic science and clinical faculty with active research and graduate school appointments may supervise rotations, and ultimately, thesis projects. Senior scientists in companies of Downstate&#39;s Advanced Biotechnology Park, located adjacent to the Downstate campus, are eligible for adjunct faculty status and, as such, may be supervisors of rotations and co-supervisors of thesis projects. In order to become a thesis supervisor, a sufficient level of extramural funding (i.e., grants, contracts, or clinical revenues) must be demonstrated.    Students whose thesis research advisors are the School of Engineering faculty are required to register at Polytechnic, whereas those whose thesis research advisors are Downstate faculty are required to register at Downstate. The same joint PhD is conferred regardless of the campus at which the student registers; the requirements for all graduate students in the program are identical.    While the PhD BME curriculum is designed to enroll students who have completed only a bachelor&#39;s degree, the program can accommodate students who have already completed a MS in Biomedical Engineering.    A qualifying examination, scheduled for no later than the end of the second year, is required to advance to candidacy for the PhD.   Tracks   Biomaterials and Polymer Therapeutics   Research in this area focuses on the development of new generation biomaterials and structures. Polytechnic has for long been an international leader in polymer chemistry. In one approach, materials are being designed to stimulate specific cellular responses at the molecular level. Examples are bioresorbable materials that cue specific biological responses to activate genes, guide cell growth and differentiation, and alter extracellular matrix production and organization. The ability to &quot;tailor&quot; polymer structures, analyze the physical properties of new biomaterials, and then process these polymers into various forms allows collaborative intercampus teams to pursue a wide range of applications. These applications include synthesis of materials for tissue engineering, drug delivery, bone screws, and more. Other research focuses on the development of biosensors for rapid detection and analysis of biological markers, ranging from single nucleotide polymorphisms to anthrax spores. Through their collaborations, investigators have developed low molar mass and high molecular weight glycolipids. Results have demonstrated the potential of the new glycolipid analogs to function as effective modulators of the immune response, anticancer agents, and as adjuvants in vaccine formulations. These studies have stimulated researchers to investigate the role of sophorolipids, in particular, in decreasing sepsis related mortality and other inflammatory diseases. Another Polytechnic/Downstate collaborative team has made significant progress in the development and targeted delivery of protease (e.g., calpain) inhibitors to treat muscular dystrophy.   Bioimaging and Neuroengineering   The collaborative approach harnesses Polytechnic&#39;s extraordinary strengths in wireless technology for applications in biotelemetry. For example, Downstate neuroscientists are working on federally funded research in neurorobotics, spatial learning, and computational neuroscience including brain modeling. The goals of these biomedical research projects are to advance therapies for spinal cord injury, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, and epilepsy, respectively. These projects will benefit greatly from advanced wireless technology, either directly as in the case of neurorobotics and navigational studies, or indirectly through data acquisition from on-line patients suffering from intractable seizures. Studies pioneered at Downstate involving remotely controlled &quot;search and rescue&quot; rats that can navigate rubble heaps, such as those associated with terrorist attacks or natural disasters, have and will continue to benefit from advances in wireless cell phone technology to improve communication with base stations. Bioimaging has historically been a strong suit at Downstate; Dr. Raymond Damadian made the first MRI image in his Downstate campus laboratory. A long-standing collaborative project of Downstate and Polytechnic investigators is in the area of optical tomography, a method of imaging biological tissue using light at near infrared wavelengths. Applications include development of a diagnostic tool for breast tumors, brain lesions, and stroke-associated ischemic brain lesions.   Courses      A.

Of those 75 credits required, at least 45 credits must be taken at the School of Engineering, including a minimum of 24 credits of dissertation research. If the courses transferred from another institution do not include all 4 core courses, the missing core courses must be taken at the School of Engineering. The remaining courses to satisfy the doctoral degree are selected in consultation with your adviser.   You must have an overall B average in the core courses, as well as in the core and elective courses (excluding seminar, chemical literature, and thesis).   You are required to declare a concentration by taking 3 courses from 1 of the following 5 areas: physical chemistry, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, biochemistry, and polymer chemistry. One of the 3 courses can be a core course. The course description indicates which courses qualify for the five areas. The GPA of the 3 courses must be B or better. You must be in continuous attendance at the departmental colloquia (CM 9710).
