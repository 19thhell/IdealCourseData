Our master's program focuses on the study of effective adult learning and development support strategies for teaching and learning business concepts and skills in public and private organizations and postsecondary education institutions. Our graduates usually come with solid business content and are able to specialize further and learn theoretical concepts related to adult learning, workplace learning, lifelong learning, instructional design and delivery, curriculum development, and research, preparing them for important educational roles.
