The Department of History offers graduate study in United States history from the colonial settlement to the present. Departmental emphases are in political, urban, social, labor, and intellectual history, from the Civil War to the present. In addition, the department offers two New York state certificate programs, which may be taken in conjunction with the masters or doctoral degree: public history and archival management/historical editing. Concentrations in women's history and African- American history are also available at the master's and doctoral level.   The History Department has close ties to the Program in Metropolitan Studies, an undergraduate sequence focusing on urban culture and policy, and the Program in American Studies, which offers an interdisciplinary approach to modern American culture leading to the master's and doctoral degree. Courses given in the latter program also rely heavily on the collections in cinema, literature, anthropology, and the performing arts.   The collection also supports teaching and research in the following departments, programs, and divisions: Politics, English, Sociology, Africana Studies, Museum Studies, the Gallatin School, the School of Education, and the School of Continuing Education.                 Scope       Language   The collection consists primarily of materials in English. Selection of materials in European languages is highly selective.       Geographical Areas   Emphasis is on the history of the United States, and to a lesser extent the history of Canada. Within the United States, coverage is extensive for New England and the Middle Atlantic States, with particular strengths in the history of New York  City and New York State. Materials on the South are less well-developed; those on the West (west of the Mississippi River) are not collected intensively.       Chronological Periods   The collection includes primary and secondary sources for all periods, from prehistory and early discovery through the Colonial period, nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the present. In keeping with departmental focus, coverage is generally  more extensive for the period from the Civil War to the present, with strong holdings for the twentieth century.                     Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, facsimiles, reprints, atlases, conference proceedings, newspapers, journals, microforms, book catalogs of major historical collections and exhibitions, video recordings, CD-ROMS, and electronic texts.       Excluded   Textbooks, manuals, maps, manuscripts, pamphlets, newsletters, and juvenile and popular materials.   Genealogical materials such as birth and death records are not collected, with the exception of certain genealogical reference materials (primarily dictionaries of names) held in General and Humanities Reference. Immigrant records (passenger  lists, registers of birth) are not collected beyond basic bibliographies.                     Strengths &amp; Weaknesses   Based on assessment of the stack collections in LC classes E and F1 - F1200, the general strengths of the collection are in social and political history from the Civil War to the present. For this era both primary and secondary sources are well represented. Highlights are African-American history, women's history; history of New York City and state, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. (See Section VI for subject and collecting levels.)   Less well represented are primary and secondary sources on the discovery of America and early exploration, the Colonial period, and the American South.   It should be noted that additional materials of interest to historians are located in other LC classes, including JK 1-1600 (politics and government of the United States), HQ (Family, Marriage, Woman), HT (Communities, Classes, Races), and HN (Social History).   In addition, stack materials in all of the above LC classes are complemented and extended by numerous microform sets. These sets are are an important addition to the retrospective book and serial collection and provide access to numerous primary sources. These sets include:     Early American Imprints I and II   Early American Newspapers   Early American Periodicals   Gerritsen Collection of Women's History   State Secession Debates, 1859-1862   State Slavery Statutes   Slavery in Ante-Bellum Southern Industries   American Immigrant Autobiographies   Voices from Ellis Island   Emma Goldman Papers   Papers of W.E.B DuBois   Papers of Margaret Sanger   Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony     Beginning with the early twentieth century, the Government Documents collection in the Social Science Reference Center is an important resource, with collections of Congressional hearings.   The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films on videotape which is of particular interest to students and faculty in the public history program. The collection is particularly strong in documentaries on labor history and the immigrant experience, African-American history, and other aspects of twentieth-century social history.   Current priorities in collection efforts are:     acquisition of multiple copies of works in heavy demand, with special attention to women's history and African-American history;   strengthening of the collection in history of the American South through retrospective purchases   selective retrospective purchases on the American discovery/exploration, and Colonial, periods   selective retrospective purchases on history of the American West   continued purchase of materials in support of the department's archival management track.                   Other Resources     Related Collections within NYU Libraries   The Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives/Tamiment Collection is a major resource for the study of United States labor and oral history and radical movements of the 20th century. The Tamiment Collection provides extensive primary materials in the form  of organizational and personal records. In addition, Tamiment collects microforms in labor and union history which fall outside the scope of the general collections. Tamiment also provides a secure copy of many older or heavily-used titles no longer  available in the stacks. The NYU Law library is a fine resource for American legal and constitutional history.   Other Collections in New York City   New York Public Library, 42nd Street Research Library has extensive monograph and serial holdings in United States and Canadian history from all periods. In particular, the United States History, Local History, and Genealogy Division offers a  extremely rich and diverse resources in local and genealogical history. The General Research Division is home to an important collection of retrospective newspapers and periodicals. The New York Public Library, Schomburg Center has extensive holdings  (both primary and secondary) in African-American history and culture. The New York Historical Society has extensive holdings in regional, state, and local history. Union and General Theological Seminary libraries have strong holdings in the religious  history of America.

Purpose     The Food Studies Collection at the Fales Library documents the evolution of cuisine and food practices in 20th century America, with a particular focus on the food habits and activity of New York City. These materials support the research of undergraduate and graduates students, faculty and other researchers working within disciplines such as food studies, food management, nutrition, performance studies, American studies, and history. Due to the nature of this collection, these materials are also of use to professionals outside of the university who work as writers, journalists, chefs or food professionals.     The Food Studies Collection at Fales began with the acquisition of the Cecily Brownstone Collection of American Cookery. This collection, numbering some 12,000 volumes and 5,000 pamphlets was the private collection of Cecily Brownstone, Associated Press food correspondent for nearly 40 years, long-time friend of James Beard, and denizen of Greenwich Village. Because library collections did not specialize in food history, Brownstone built an astonishing personal collection, which was housed in her home on Jane Street. With the help of an anonymous donor, the Fales Library acquired the printed books and Brownstone's papers in 2001.     The Fales Library is committed to preserving historical documents in their original format, paying close attention to the physical traits of the objects. Artifacts preserved in Fales are intended for scholarly research that requires original materials. Fales complements the collection policies of the general stacks by supplying rare or fine editions of texts or other materials and by prospectively collecting works that will become important historical evidence.     II. Scope     A. American Cookery Collection: Books and Pamphlets     1. General Guidelines     The collection includes cookbooks, magazines, pamphlets and books exploring or documenting food habits and practices. Materials that reflect the culinary trends, diets and food practices in the United States and New York City from World War II to the present are the primary focus of this collection. The intention is not to select the &quot;best&quot; or most praised cookbooks or food volumes, but to select those volumes offering the greatest insight into food trends, food practices, and the role of food in society.     2. Retrospective Collecting     Attention is given to filling in any major gaps within the American cookery collection. In particular, any foundational volumes of American cookery - cookbooks defining the scope of American cuisine - not already owned will be sought. Because recipe and organizational changes made from edition to edition reflect important shifts in food habits and diet perspectives, all editions of core cookbooks will be collected when possible. Attention is also given to the acquisition of books documenting the establishment and evolution of New York City foodways and cuisine.     3. Prospective Collecting     Prospective collecting will involve the acquisition of cookbooks and food volumes that reflect current culinary, diet and dining habits. Although awards such as the James Beard Award and the IACP award will be used to help select important volumes, it is recognized that other less acclaimed volumes also play an important role and reveal a great deal about American food habits.     4. Primary and Secondary Literature     Primary materials such as cookbooks, pamphlets, menus, food essays, and memoirs are collected by the Fales Library. Secondary materials in food studies scholarship from disciplines such as food studies, performance studies, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, women's studies and American studies will be collected by and held in the general stacks.     5. Language     Due to the nature of this collection and its emphasis on American and New York cookery, most collected materials are published in English. However, due to the multinational and multiethnic nature of the United States in general and American cuisine in particular, it is occasionally necessary to collect materials in other languages. Such materials are collected if they are deemed to have an influence on American cuisine in general or are integral to a particular ethnic or immigrant group residing in the United States.     6. Geographical Aspects     The majority of volumes collected are American cookbooks; however, due to the nature of American cookery, cookbooks highlighting cuisines from around the world are represented. For the most part, despite international content, these volumes are published in the United States. Because early Americans cooked, in large part, from British cookbooks, important British cookbooks from the colonial period are collected as well.     7. Chronological Aspects          Pre-1800: Early American cookbooks and the British cookbooks used in America during this period. This period is not a strength of the collection.              1801-1900: The fundamental and most used cookbooks from this period, both American and British, are collected.              1901-Present: This most recent century is the strength of the collection, particularly post WWII to the present.         B. Manuscripts and Archives     1. General Guidelines     Materials that illuminate the past and present of New York City food and food habits are the primary foci of manuscript and archive collecting. The personal papers of individuals working within and reflecting on New York food practices are collected as are the archives and records of food businesses and institutions such as: food purveyors, restaurants, markets, food organizations and government institutions.     2. Retrospective Collecting     Attention is given to individuals and organizations defining New York City cuisine and food habits from the early 20th century to the present. Such individuals and organizations may include chefs, food writers, purveyors, restaurants, distributors, food organizations and government institutions. Materials collected retrospectively offer insight into early New York City foodways including the trends and food items that define New York City cuisine. In addition to the manuscripts of food luminaries and the records of restaurants and established food businesses, materials collected may include the papers and records of small-scale merchants and pushcart peddlers whose experiences reflect the food practices of their time.     3. Prospective Collecting     Prospective collecting will involve the acquisition of manuscripts and records of individuals and organizations making significant contributions to the food world. These materials will document current trends in food consumption, production and distribution.     4. Language     Due its emphasis on New York City cuisine and foodways, most collected materials are in English. However, due to the multinational and multiethnic nature of New York City people and cuisine, it is occasionally necessary to collect materials in other language, particularly in order to document the food and experiences of New York City immigrants.     5. Geographical Aspects     Manuscripts and records collected as part of the American Cookery Collection relate primarily to the food and food habits of New York City including Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island.     6. Chronological Aspects          Pre-1800: This period is not a strength of the collection.              1801-1880: This period is not a strength of the collection.              1880-1940: Materials collected in this period will document New York City's immigrant history and the introduction of many of New York's now iconic foods.              1940-Present: This most recent period is the strength of the collection. It documents the development and evolution of American cuisine and of New York City as a culinary center.         III. Types of materials     The Fales Library's collection of American cookery includes books, pamphlets, magazines, manuscripts, recipe cards, menus, records and ephemeral materials. Emphasis is placed on acquiring items in their original states; preference is given to first editions. Facsimiles of historical cookbooks are purchased, but sparingly. Most facsimiles should be purchased by the general stacks.     IV. Strengths and Weaknesses     Strengths     Strengths lie in the extensive post WWII collection of American cookery books - one of the largest culinary collections in the country. The collection also includes approximately 5000 publicity recipe pamphlets published by food and equipment manufacturers.     Weaknesses     Collection weaknesses include recent cookbooks published after 1990. The collection of books published prior to the 20th century is also less comprehensive and more selective than those published in the last 100 years.     V. Preservation     Because many of these volumes are cookbooks, they have been used as such, and some show kitchen wear. Many have paper jackets that are tearing or badly worn and some are in need of Mylar jackets. Early volumes have gone through several ownerships and many are badly worn, with brittle pages and bindings in need or repair or replacement.     VI. Transfer Criteria for Moving General Stacks Materials to Special Collections     Cookbooks and other primary cookery materials will be collected and held by the Fales Library. The general stacks will house all secondary materials including books, anthologies, journals, encyclopedias and other reference materials related to food and cookery. Food memoirs, essays or literature will also be collected by and held within the general stacks, except in instances of rare or autographed volumes, which will be transferred to the Fales Library.     VII. Deaccession Policy for the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections     Introduction:     The deaccession of materials in special collections is governed by different principles from those for general research collections. Because of the primacy of preserving special collections materials in their original format and, concomitant with that, the role of special collections as repositories of cultural history, the Fales Library will carefully assess all materials before accepting them to lessen the likelihood of deaccession. This said, there are valid reasons why materials in special collections may be deacessioned.     Acknowledging these points, The Rare Book and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries included a lengthy set of guidelines for deaccession of materials in Standards for Ethical Conduct for Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Librarians, with Guidelines for Institutional Practice in Support of the Standards, 2d edition, 1992. The following policy for deaccession of materials from the Fales Library and Special Collections incorporates and upholds the standards established by RBMS for the ethical deaccessioning of material from special collections.     Guidelines for the Deaccession of Materials:     In the deacession of rare books and manuscripts, the Fales Library will weigh carefully the interests of the public for which it holds the collections in trust, the interests of the scholarly and cultural community, and the Fales Library's own mission.     The Fales Library will consider any legal restrictions, the necessity for possession of valid time, and the donor's intent in the broader sense. Procedures for the deaccession or disposal of materials will be at least as rigorous as those for purchasing and should be governed by the same basic principles. The decision to dispose of materials must be made only after full and scrupulous consideration of the public interest and the needs of researchers; the process of deaccession will be carried out in as open and public a manner as possible.     Mandatory restrictions on disposition which accompanied a donation will be observed unless it can be shown clearly by appropriate legal procedures that adherence to them is impossible or substantially detrimental to the New York University. When statements of donor's preferences accompany an acquisition, any departure from them will be carefully considered and negotiated with the donor or the donor's heirs or settled by appropriate legal procedures.     Responsibility to the needs and reputation of the Fales Library requires that in preparing for and accomplishing any deaccession, the Fales Library will take care to define and publicly state the purpose of the deaccession and the intended use of monetary or other proceeds of the deaccession, to avoid any procedure which may detract from the Library's reputation for honesty and responsible conduct, and to carry out the entire process in a way which will not detract from public perception of its responsible stewardship. The following points must be taken into consideration:          The Fales Library will insure that the method of deaccession will result in furthering the agreed purpose of the deaccession, whether this be monetary gain or more appropriate placement of scholarly resources.              The Fales Library will disclose to the potential new owner or intermediary agent any action, such as the retention of a photocopy of the material, which may affect the monetary or scholarly value.              To the fullest extent possible, the Fales Library will make public information on the disposition of deaccessioned materials.              The Fales Library will not allow materials from its collections to be acquired privately by any library employee, officer, or volunteer, unless they are sold publicly and with complete disclosure of their history.              Due to consideration should be given to the library community in general when disposing of items. Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.         VIII. Other Resources     In addition to the food and cookery holdings at the Fales Library, New York researchers will find useful materials at the following New York libraries and archives.     Columbia University Libraries     The majority of this collection is housed at the Butler Library, which holds approximately 40 titles prior to 1800. Additionally, the Teacher's College Russel Library holds approximately 1000 titles written by women who operated or taught at domestic science and cookery schools.     Cornell University Libraries     The nucleus of Cornell's food and cookery materials are held at the Nestle Library and support the Cornell School of Hotel and Business Administration. The library includes the J.B. Herndon collection of mostly late 19th and early 20th century materials and the Joseph D. Vehling collection of approximately 500 titles from the 15th to early 20th century.     The Culinary Institute of America, Conrad N. Hilton Library     This collection of primarily 20th century texts supports academic and professional courses at the Culinary Institute of America. The library's collection of rare materials consists primarily of French classics dating from the 16th century through the 19th century. Collected menus date primarily from 1950 to 1990 and include menus from every state, over 75 countries, and feature airline, cruise ship and railroad menus.     The James Beard Foundation Library     Holdings consists of James Beard's books; James Beard Award-winning books; complete sets of Petits Propos Culinaires , The Journal of Gastronomy , Cuisine , and Gourmet .     New York Academy of Medicine Library  Holdings date from 9th century to the present and include the Dr. Margaret Barclay Wilson collection. Contemporary materials focus primarily on health and diets.  The New York Public Library, Humanities and Social Science Division   The library holds a large variety of food and cookery materials with an emphasis on the 17th and 18th centuries. The library also holds the Helen Hayes Whitney collection of over 200 cookbooks from the 15th to the 20th century and the Buttoloph Menu collection."}]},

The Department of History offers graduate study in United States history from the colonial settlement to the present. Departmental emphases are in political, urban, social, labor, and intellectual history, from the Civil War to the present. In addition, the department offers two New York state certificate programs, which may be taken in conjunction with the masters or doctoral degree: public history and archival management/historical editing. Concentrations in women's history and African- American history are also available at the master's and doctoral level.   The History Department has close ties to the Program in Metropolitan Studies, an undergraduate sequence focusing on urban culture and policy, and the Program in American Studies, which offers an interdisciplinary approach to modern American culture leading to the master's and doctoral degree. Courses given in the latter program also rely heavily on the collections in cinema, literature, anthropology, and the performing arts.   The collection also supports teaching and research in the following departments, programs, and divisions: Politics, English, Sociology, Africana Studies, Museum Studies, the Gallatin School, the School of Education, and the School of Continuing Education.                 Scope       Language   The collection consists primarily of materials in English. Selection of materials in European languages is highly selective.       Geographical Areas   Emphasis is on the history of the United States, and to a lesser extent the history of Canada. Within the United States, coverage is extensive for New England and the Middle Atlantic States, with particular strengths in the history of New York  City and New York State. Materials on the South are less well-developed; those on the West (west of the Mississippi River) are not collected intensively.       Chronological Periods   The collection includes primary and secondary sources for all periods, from prehistory and early discovery through the Colonial period, nineteenth and twentieth centuries to the present. In keeping with departmental focus, coverage is generally  more extensive for the period from the Civil War to the present, with strong holdings for the twentieth century.                     Types of Materials       Included   Monographs, monographic series, facsimiles, reprints, atlases, conference proceedings, newspapers, journals, microforms, book catalogs of major historical collections and exhibitions, video recordings, CD-ROMS, and electronic texts.       Excluded   Textbooks, manuals, maps, manuscripts, pamphlets, newsletters, and juvenile and popular materials.   Genealogical materials such as birth and death records are not collected, with the exception of certain genealogical reference materials (primarily dictionaries of names) held in General and Humanities Reference. Immigrant records (passenger  lists, registers of birth) are not collected beyond basic bibliographies.                     Strengths &amp; Weaknesses   Based on assessment of the stack collections in LC classes E and F1 - F1200, the general strengths of the collection are in social and political history from the Civil War to the present. For this era both primary and secondary sources are well represented. Highlights are African-American history, women's history; history of New York City and state, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. (See Section VI for subject and collecting levels.)   Less well represented are primary and secondary sources on the discovery of America and early exploration, the Colonial period, and the American South.   It should be noted that additional materials of interest to historians are located in other LC classes, including JK 1-1600 (politics and government of the United States), HQ (Family, Marriage, Woman), HT (Communities, Classes, Races), and HN (Social History).   In addition, stack materials in all of the above LC classes are complemented and extended by numerous microform sets. These sets are are an important addition to the retrospective book and serial collection and provide access to numerous primary sources. These sets include:     Early American Imprints I and II   Early American Newspapers   Early American Periodicals   Gerritsen Collection of Women's History   State Secession Debates, 1859-1862   State Slavery Statutes   Slavery in Ante-Bellum Southern Industries   American Immigrant Autobiographies   Voices from Ellis Island   Emma Goldman Papers   Papers of W.E.B DuBois   Papers of Margaret Sanger   Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony     Beginning with the early twentieth century, the Government Documents collection in the Social Science Reference Center is an important resource, with collections of Congressional hearings.   The Avery Fisher Center houses a large collection of films on videotape which is of particular interest to students and faculty in the public history program. The collection is particularly strong in documentaries on labor history and the immigrant experience, African-American history, and other aspects of twentieth-century social history.   Current priorities in collection efforts are:     acquisition of multiple copies of works in heavy demand, with special attention to women's history and African-American history;   strengthening of the collection in history of the American South through retrospective purchases   selective retrospective purchases on the American discovery/exploration, and Colonial, periods   selective retrospective purchases on history of the American West   continued purchase of materials in support of the department's archival management track.                   Other Resources     Related Collections within NYU Libraries   The Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives/Tamiment Collection is a major resource for the study of United States labor and oral history and radical movements of the 20th century. The Tamiment Collection provides extensive primary materials in the form  of organizational and personal records. In addition, Tamiment collects microforms in labor and union history which fall outside the scope of the general collections. Tamiment also provides a secure copy of many older or heavily-used titles no longer  available in the stacks. The NYU Law library is a fine resource for American legal and constitutional history.   Other Collections in New York City   New York Public Library, 42nd Street Research Library has extensive monograph and serial holdings in United States and Canadian history from all periods. In particular, the United States History, Local History, and Genealogy Division offers a  extremely rich and diverse resources in local and genealogical history. The General Research Division is home to an important collection of retrospective newspapers and periodicals. The New York Public Library, Schomburg Center has extensive holdings  (both primary and secondary) in African-American history and culture. The New York Historical Society has extensive holdings in regional, state, and local history. Union and General Theological Seminary libraries have strong holdings in the religious  history of America.

Purpose     The Food Studies Collection at the Fales Library documents the evolution of cuisine and food practices in 20th century America, with a particular focus on the food habits and activity of New York City. These materials support the research of undergraduate and graduates students, faculty and other researchers working within disciplines such as food studies, food management, nutrition, performance studies, American studies, and history. Due to the nature of this collection, these materials are also of use to professionals outside of the university who work as writers, journalists, chefs or food professionals.     The Food Studies Collection at Fales began with the acquisition of the Cecily Brownstone Collection of American Cookery. This collection, numbering some 12,000 volumes and 5,000 pamphlets was the private collection of Cecily Brownstone, Associated Press food correspondent for nearly 40 years, long-time friend of James Beard, and denizen of Greenwich Village. Because library collections did not specialize in food history, Brownstone built an astonishing personal collection, which was housed in her home on Jane Street. With the help of an anonymous donor, the Fales Library acquired the printed books and Brownstone's papers in 2001.     The Fales Library is committed to preserving historical documents in their original format, paying close attention to the physical traits of the objects. Artifacts preserved in Fales are intended for scholarly research that requires original materials. Fales complements the collection policies of the general stacks by supplying rare or fine editions of texts or other materials and by prospectively collecting works that will become important historical evidence.     II. Scope     A. American Cookery Collection: Books and Pamphlets     1. General Guidelines     The collection includes cookbooks, magazines, pamphlets and books exploring or documenting food habits and practices. Materials that reflect the culinary trends, diets and food practices in the United States and New York City from World War II to the present are the primary focus of this collection. The intention is not to select the &quot;best&quot; or most praised cookbooks or food volumes, but to select those volumes offering the greatest insight into food trends, food practices, and the role of food in society.     2. Retrospective Collecting     Attention is given to filling in any major gaps within the American cookery collection. In particular, any foundational volumes of American cookery - cookbooks defining the scope of American cuisine - not already owned will be sought. Because recipe and organizational changes made from edition to edition reflect important shifts in food habits and diet perspectives, all editions of core cookbooks will be collected when possible. Attention is also given to the acquisition of books documenting the establishment and evolution of New York City foodways and cuisine.     3. Prospective Collecting     Prospective collecting will involve the acquisition of cookbooks and food volumes that reflect current culinary, diet and dining habits. Although awards such as the James Beard Award and the IACP award will be used to help select important volumes, it is recognized that other less acclaimed volumes also play an important role and reveal a great deal about American food habits.     4. Primary and Secondary Literature     Primary materials such as cookbooks, pamphlets, menus, food essays, and memoirs are collected by the Fales Library. Secondary materials in food studies scholarship from disciplines such as food studies, performance studies, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, women's studies and American studies will be collected by and held in the general stacks.     5. Language     Due to the nature of this collection and its emphasis on American and New York cookery, most collected materials are published in English. However, due to the multinational and multiethnic nature of the United States in general and American cuisine in particular, it is occasionally necessary to collect materials in other languages. Such materials are collected if they are deemed to have an influence on American cuisine in general or are integral to a particular ethnic or immigrant group residing in the United States.     6. Geographical Aspects     The majority of volumes collected are American cookbooks; however, due to the nature of American cookery, cookbooks highlighting cuisines from around the world are represented. For the most part, despite international content, these volumes are published in the United States. Because early Americans cooked, in large part, from British cookbooks, important British cookbooks from the colonial period are collected as well.     7. Chronological Aspects          Pre-1800: Early American cookbooks and the British cookbooks used in America during this period. This period is not a strength of the collection.              1801-1900: The fundamental and most used cookbooks from this period, both American and British, are collected.              1901-Present: This most recent century is the strength of the collection, particularly post WWII to the present.         B. Manuscripts and Archives     1. General Guidelines     Materials that illuminate the past and present of New York City food and food habits are the primary foci of manuscript and archive collecting. The personal papers of individuals working within and reflecting on New York food practices are collected as are the archives and records of food businesses and institutions such as: food purveyors, restaurants, markets, food organizations and government institutions.     2. Retrospective Collecting     Attention is given to individuals and organizations defining New York City cuisine and food habits from the early 20th century to the present. Such individuals and organizations may include chefs, food writers, purveyors, restaurants, distributors, food organizations and government institutions. Materials collected retrospectively offer insight into early New York City foodways including the trends and food items that define New York City cuisine. In addition to the manuscripts of food luminaries and the records of restaurants and established food businesses, materials collected may include the papers and records of small-scale merchants and pushcart peddlers whose experiences reflect the food practices of their time.     3. Prospective Collecting     Prospective collecting will involve the acquisition of manuscripts and records of individuals and organizations making significant contributions to the food world. These materials will document current trends in food consumption, production and distribution.     4. Language     Due its emphasis on New York City cuisine and foodways, most collected materials are in English. However, due to the multinational and multiethnic nature of New York City people and cuisine, it is occasionally necessary to collect materials in other language, particularly in order to document the food and experiences of New York City immigrants.     5. Geographical Aspects     Manuscripts and records collected as part of the American Cookery Collection relate primarily to the food and food habits of New York City including Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx and Staten Island.     6. Chronological Aspects          Pre-1800: This period is not a strength of the collection.              1801-1880: This period is not a strength of the collection.              1880-1940: Materials collected in this period will document New York City's immigrant history and the introduction of many of New York's now iconic foods.              1940-Present: This most recent period is the strength of the collection. It documents the development and evolution of American cuisine and of New York City as a culinary center.         III. Types of materials     The Fales Library's collection of American cookery includes books, pamphlets, magazines, manuscripts, recipe cards, menus, records and ephemeral materials. Emphasis is placed on acquiring items in their original states; preference is given to first editions. Facsimiles of historical cookbooks are purchased, but sparingly. Most facsimiles should be purchased by the general stacks.     IV. Strengths and Weaknesses     Strengths     Strengths lie in the extensive post WWII collection of American cookery books - one of the largest culinary collections in the country. The collection also includes approximately 5000 publicity recipe pamphlets published by food and equipment manufacturers.     Weaknesses     Collection weaknesses include recent cookbooks published after 1990. The collection of books published prior to the 20th century is also less comprehensive and more selective than those published in the last 100 years.     V. Preservation     Because many of these volumes are cookbooks, they have been used as such, and some show kitchen wear. Many have paper jackets that are tearing or badly worn and some are in need of Mylar jackets. Early volumes have gone through several ownerships and many are badly worn, with brittle pages and bindings in need or repair or replacement.     VI. Transfer Criteria for Moving General Stacks Materials to Special Collections     Cookbooks and other primary cookery materials will be collected and held by the Fales Library. The general stacks will house all secondary materials including books, anthologies, journals, encyclopedias and other reference materials related to food and cookery. Food memoirs, essays or literature will also be collected by and held within the general stacks, except in instances of rare or autographed volumes, which will be transferred to the Fales Library.     VII. Deaccession Policy for the Fales Library &amp; Special Collections     Introduction:     The deaccession of materials in special collections is governed by different principles from those for general research collections. Because of the primacy of preserving special collections materials in their original format and, concomitant with that, the role of special collections as repositories of cultural history, the Fales Library will carefully assess all materials before accepting them to lessen the likelihood of deaccession. This said, there are valid reasons why materials in special collections may be deacessioned.     Acknowledging these points, The Rare Book and Manuscripts Section of the Association of College and Research Libraries included a lengthy set of guidelines for deaccession of materials in Standards for Ethical Conduct for Rare Book, Manuscript, and Special Collections Librarians, with Guidelines for Institutional Practice in Support of the Standards, 2d edition, 1992. The following policy for deaccession of materials from the Fales Library and Special Collections incorporates and upholds the standards established by RBMS for the ethical deaccessioning of material from special collections.     Guidelines for the Deaccession of Materials:     In the deacession of rare books and manuscripts, the Fales Library will weigh carefully the interests of the public for which it holds the collections in trust, the interests of the scholarly and cultural community, and the Fales Library's own mission.     The Fales Library will consider any legal restrictions, the necessity for possession of valid time, and the donor's intent in the broader sense. Procedures for the deaccession or disposal of materials will be at least as rigorous as those for purchasing and should be governed by the same basic principles. The decision to dispose of materials must be made only after full and scrupulous consideration of the public interest and the needs of researchers; the process of deaccession will be carried out in as open and public a manner as possible.     Mandatory restrictions on disposition which accompanied a donation will be observed unless it can be shown clearly by appropriate legal procedures that adherence to them is impossible or substantially detrimental to the New York University. When statements of donor's preferences accompany an acquisition, any departure from them will be carefully considered and negotiated with the donor or the donor's heirs or settled by appropriate legal procedures.     Responsibility to the needs and reputation of the Fales Library requires that in preparing for and accomplishing any deaccession, the Fales Library will take care to define and publicly state the purpose of the deaccession and the intended use of monetary or other proceeds of the deaccession, to avoid any procedure which may detract from the Library's reputation for honesty and responsible conduct, and to carry out the entire process in a way which will not detract from public perception of its responsible stewardship. The following points must be taken into consideration:          The Fales Library will insure that the method of deaccession will result in furthering the agreed purpose of the deaccession, whether this be monetary gain or more appropriate placement of scholarly resources.              The Fales Library will disclose to the potential new owner or intermediary agent any action, such as the retention of a photocopy of the material, which may affect the monetary or scholarly value.              To the fullest extent possible, the Fales Library will make public information on the disposition of deaccessioned materials.              The Fales Library will not allow materials from its collections to be acquired privately by any library employee, officer, or volunteer, unless they are sold publicly and with complete disclosure of their history.              Due to consideration should be given to the library community in general when disposing of items. Sales to, or exchanges between, institutions will be explored as well as disposal through the trade.         VIII. Other Resources     In addition to the food and cookery holdings at the Fales Library, New York researchers will find useful materials at the following New York libraries and archives.     Columbia University Libraries     The majority of this collection is housed at the Butler Library, which holds approximately 40 titles prior to 1800. Additionally, the Teacher's College Russel Library holds approximately 1000 titles written by women who operated or taught at domestic science and cookery schools.     Cornell University Libraries     The nucleus of Cornell's food and cookery materials are held at the Nestle Library and support the Cornell School of Hotel and Business Administration. The library includes the J.B. Herndon collection of mostly late 19th and early 20th century materials and the Joseph D. Vehling collection of approximately 500 titles from the 15th to early 20th century.     The Culinary Institute of America, Conrad N. Hilton Library     This collection of primarily 20th century texts supports academic and professional courses at the Culinary Institute of America. The library's collection of rare materials consists primarily of French classics dating from the 16th century through the 19th century. Collected menus date primarily from 1950 to 1990 and include menus from every state, over 75 countries, and feature airline, cruise ship and railroad menus.     The James Beard Foundation Library     Holdings consists of James Beard's books; James Beard Award-winning books; complete sets of Petits Propos Culinaires , The Journal of Gastronomy , Cuisine , and Gourmet .     New York Academy of Medicine Library  Holdings date from 9th century to the present and include the Dr. Margaret Barclay Wilson collection. Contemporary materials focus primarily on health and diets.  The New York Public Library, Humanities and Social Science Division   The library holds a large variety of food and cookery materials with an emphasis on the 17th and 18th centuries. The library also holds the Helen Hayes Whitney collection of over 200 cookbooks from the 15th to the 20th century and the Buttoloph Menu collection."}, {"content": "New York University | Bobst Library: Latin American and Caribbean Studies Collection Development Policy                                                                                             Search           Search:                BobCat        BobCat Standard        Archival Collections        HSLCat (NYU Medical)        Julius (NYU Law)            Search This Site            WorldCat        CATNYP (NYPL)        CLIO (Columbia University)                Google Books        Google Scholar        Amazon.com                                                                              Home    Find Resources        Articles and Databases   Books &amp; More via BobCat    Call Number & Floor Maps     ebooks   Images   Journals    Special Collections/Archives   Videos &amp; Music   Virtual Business Library   Other Catalogs           Research Assistance        Ask a Librarian   Citation Tools   Data Services   Digital Scholarship   Digital Studio   Library Classes   QuickRef   Request an appointment   Research &amp; How-To Guides   Subject Librarians   Tutorials           Services        Borrow &amp; Request   Computing   Course Reserves   Disability Services   Faculty Services   Global Services   Graduate Student Services   Interlibrary Loan (ILL)   Print, Copy, Scan   Services A-Z   Study Spaces   Suggest a Purchase   Alumni &amp; Friends           About        About NYU Libraries   Career Opportunities   General Information   Giving to the Libraries   Hours &amp; Access   Library Locations   Library Policies   NYU Press   Staff Directory   What's New           Help             Ask a Librarian   FAQs   Library Classes   Research Guides   Search this Site   Subject Librarians                          Find Resources        Articles and Databases   Books &amp; More via BobCat    Call Number & Floor Maps     ebooks   Images   Journals    Special Collections/Archives   Videos &amp; Music   Virtual Business Library   Other Catalogs                          Latin American and Caribbean Studies Collection Development Policy             Bobst Library, New York University      Angela Carre&ntilde;o , Librarian for Latin American and Caribbean Studies             Contents           Purpose      Scope      Types of Materials      Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection      Other Resources      Subjects &amp; Collecting Levels                          Purpose         Bobst Library's Latin American and Caribbean studies collection supports the academic program of the     Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS) ,    which offers an interdisciplinary master's degree, a joint M.A. degree in Journalism and a certificate program in museum studies.    CLACS has a consortial arrangement with Columbia University's Institute for Iberian and Latin American Studies     which includes the cross-registration of students, joint summer institutes and joint public events.    The Center integrates the resources of New York University for the study of inter-American affairs, stressing the study of contemporary relations--    the emerging social, cultural, economic, and political links between and among the Americas.    The future priorities of CLACS include strengthening and expanding programs in Caribbean Studies, and the development of closer ties with the professional schools.            The collection also supports Latin American and Caribbean area studies course concentrations for doctoral programs in anthropology, cinema studies,     comparative literature, business administration, economics, history, politics, sociology, and Spanish and Portuguese languages and literatures.            Increasingly, in recent years, the collection has developed in response to the needs of issue based, inter-disciplinary studies and closer interaction between CLACS and the professional schools.    Issue based structures within FAS and/or GSAS include departments or programs in Africana Studies, Ethnographic Film and Video, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Metropolitan Studies, Peace and Global Policy Studies, and Women's Studies.    Recent global issues attracting cross-disciplinary interest and transnational perspectives include cultural studies, human rights, urban life, migration studies, environmental studies, post-colonial studies and communication studies.    Several Centers will be the focus of significant future, on-campus trends in cross-disciplinary research and teaching:    1) The King Juan Carlos I Center for the Study of Spain and the Spanish-speaking world ;    2) the Center for Media, Culture, and History; and    3) the NYU Institutes for Advanced International Studies.        Departmental interests are as follows:               History           Latin American and Caribbean history from 1492 to the present.     All countries are of interest for historical research and course work; emphasis has, historically been on Brazil and the Caribbean.     Recent interests include the Andean region and the African Diaspora.                    Politics           Political institutions, development, reform, revolution; U.S. corporate and governmental policy; common markets and collective trading groups;     urban politics; Latin American and Caribbean migration to the U.S. and Western Europe, and communities of Latin American and Caribbean nationals in the U.S. and Western Europe;     emphasis is on the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico.                    Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures      (See separate collection development statement) - Spanish-American and Brazilian authors, literary criticism, literary movements, and Latin American civilization.                Linguistics      Urban Hispanic and/or Afro-Latin American diasporic sociolinguistic varieties, bilingualism, indigenous and creole languages.

Performance Studies      Theater, dance, celebration, ritual and popular entertainment, including for example cricket, carnival, soccer, feminist theater projects, calypso, cockfighting, soap opera, comics, cuisine, voodoo, and political campaigns.                Sociology           Structure and dynamics of contemporary Latin American societies, covering sociological theory (major Latin American theorists, themes and debates);     power and inequality (social stratification, gender relations, race relations, social movements, and political sociology);     social institutions (kinship, class, political parties, church, schools, the army, family, labor organizations etc.);     and social groups (women, blacks, immigrants, children, indigenous groups, elite groups, peasant groups, etc.)                    Music      Performance practice; music industry; music history, biography, and criticism; popular song and dance music (tango, rumba, reggae, samba, tropicalia, zouk, etc.)                    Fine Arts           Pre-Columbian art and archeology; material culture and folk art; major artists and museums; reproductions of historically significant prints and photographs;     aesthetics of cities; public policy; art history; and, art exhibit catalogs.                    Comparative Literature      In addition to Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures (see separate collection development statement), non-hispanic Caribbean diasporic authors, literary criticism, literary movements, and cultural studies.                          Scope               Language           Materials are acquired in Spanish, English, Portuguese, and, more selectively, French, German and Dutch.     Codices, grammars, etc. of indigenous languages are acquired very selectively.     English translations of titles in languages not collected are acquired when available and of scholarly interest.                    Geographical Areas           All countries of Latin America and the Caribbean region are covered, although research trends and political events intensify collection effort for particular countries or regions at given times.     Geographical areas emphasized are Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, the Caribbean and Central America.     Latin American and Caribbean communities in the United States and Western Europe are of interest for migration and ethnic studies;     emphasis is on the Caribbean diaspora.                    Chronological Periods           Emphasis is on all historical periods from European conquest to the present.     The pre-Columbian period is of more limited interest in the Departments of Anthropology and History, and resources covering this period are acquired more selectively.                              Types of Materials               Included           Monographs, monographic series, serials, proceedings, facsimiles, microforms, videos, music recordings, electronic media, multi-media, and Internet resources.     Government documents, atlases, dissertations, scores, working papers, pamphlets, and ephemera are acquired on a more selective basis.                    Excluded      Maps, textbooks and juvenilia.                          Strengths &amp; Weaknesses of the Collection   Collection development for Latin America and the Caribbean focuses primarily on the history, politics, international relations, social and economic conditions, literatures and languages of Latin America and the Caribbean. Historically, the strengths of the collection are literature and the political, economic and social history of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Collecting is stronger in the humanities than in the social sciences.    The collection coverage for individual authors, literary criticism and literary movements is very good. The contemporary Brazilian fiction and poetry collection is noteworthy and serves as a resource for scholars throughout the metropolitan area. The collection in Caribbean history and literature, all language areas and the diaspora is steadily becoming a noteworthy collection. The audio-visual collection is nationally unique. Areas of relatively recent scholarly interest at NYU are currently being developed and strengthened: art, music, business, popular culture, migration studies, environmental studies and women's studies.    In 1982, the library started to implement blanket order acquisition plans with Latin American vendors. These plans currently cover Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela, Central America, Mexico, and the British Caribbean. Under the terms of these plans current imprints from various Latin American countries are automatically received at Bobst Library. These agreements have dramatically improved the coverage and timeliness of current imprints. The blanket order shipments are considerably augmented by firm orders generated by dealers' catalogs, publishers' catalogs, library acquistions' lists, bibliographies and review media.    The Business and Social Science/Documents Center hold many important resources for social science research on Latin America and the Caribbean. The United Nations and International Governmental Organizations Collection receives on deposit or standing order, the publications of the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America, the Organization of American States, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the International Labor Office and the International Council for Migration. Most of these government documents do not appear in BobCat. The Center also has extensive microform collections covering historical and current socio-economic statistics.    The library offers a wide range of electronic resources, including remote and in-library access to the the Hispanic American Periodicals Index (HAPI), LADB (Latin American Database) and the Handbook of Latin American Studies (HLAS). The Library offers a wide range of commercial databases which contain Latin American information, including PAIS, the MLA Bibliography, F&amp;S International, Ethnic Newswatch, and Dissertation Abstracts. The Library also has a Latin American Studies Resources Homepage . Multi-media, electronic text and electronic data on CD-ROM are collected very selectively. and, strategically, Since January 1993, the library has offered the academic community Latin American newsbroadcasts via satellite through SCOLA. SCOLA programming is available for viewing in the library as well as at other locations around the University where NYU-TV broadcasting is available. SCOLA programs may be recorded off-air for use in classrooms or by individual researchers.    Some of the collection weaknesses are as follows:        government publications, except for population census material and statistical abstracts. The library relies on holdings at New York Public Library and LAMP . This will not change unless we agree to cooperate regionally.        serials in general. There are historical gaps in history and literature which are impossible to fill, unless microform copies can be identified for purchase. Current subscriptiohns have been added on a very selective basis for the past ten years due to budgetary constraints.        current news sources. The cost and difficulty of acquiring and processing newspapers and newsmagazines have resulted in limited holdings. In addition to the limited holdings the library relies on newspaper clipping services, the Latin American Newsletters, Global Newsbank, LADB, FBIS, and SCOLA. The library is currently working on a regional cooperative collecting agreement.        Newspaper backfiles. The library currently relies on news clipping services, FBIS, regional holdings, CRL and LAMP . The library is considering adding a limited number of backfiles based on regional gaps, and cooperative collection agreements. So far the library has added Uno m&aacute;s Uno.        current social and economic statistics. The library relies on the statistical publications of international organizations and a selection of Latin American statistical publications available on microform. The statistics are reported in these sources with two to three delays. The library may need to consider adding a selection of statistical abstracts in paper.        preservation problems have contributed to the gaps in the library's Latin American collection. New titles from Latin America and the Caribbean are printed on poor quality paper which does not withstand heavy use and aging. The library is addressing the problem by routinely binding new material, and replacing brittle material with microfilm copy.        Pre-1950 imprints. Retrospective collection assessment and development is a constant necessity to identify and, if possible fill lacunae. Important retrospective material is often reprinted, re-published in new editions, or microfilmed. It is very difficult, and, usually too costly to purchase and preserve original editions.                     Resource Sharing      Numerous and complex factors such as the proliferation of research materials, lack of sufficient acquisitions funds and the physical deterioration of large portions of the collection have forced research libraries to recognize their inability to be entirely self-sufficient, and the need to rely on cooperative collection development and user referrals to other collections. Coordinated resource sharing makes it possible to offer Latin American scholars in the region, and specifically at New York University, a wider range of research material.     The logical and most important coordinating partner is Columbia University Libraries. In 1988 the two institutions established a Consortium for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, which has stimulated frequent contact between the bibliographers to coordinate, among other things, respective collection development policies. The two bibliographers actively develop collaborative projects that will increase the breadth and depth of Latin American holdings in the New York metropolitan area. Examples of formal agreements include sharing coverage of Latin American and Caribbean 2nd tier women writers; migrant communities in Europe; and Latin American Recorded Popular Music. Major purchasing, such as the recent acquisition of the  Author Catalogues of the Biblioteca Nacional, Madrid  and the  Archivo Biogr&aacute;fico de Espa&ntilde;a, Portugal e Iberoam&eacute;rica,  is done collaboratively.     As participating member of the  Latin American Northeast Library Consortium (LANE)  , the Latin American Bibliographer meets with colleagues in the Northeast twice a year to discuss collection development issues. The other participating bibliographers are from NYPL, Columbia Univ. Rutgers Univ., Univ. Of Connecticut at Storrs, Univ. Of Mass., Univ. Of Pittsburg, Princeton Univ., Univ. of Pennsylvannia, Yale Univ., Brown Univ., Cornell Univ., and Harvard Univ. LANE is currently planning to coordinate, jointly identify and/or broaden the coverage of 1) current newspaper and newsweekly subscriptions; 2) historical backfiles of newspapers and newsweeklies; 3) financial statistical sources; 4) videos from and/or about Latin America; 5) business news sources; 6) telephone books; and 7) major microform sets.     The LANE group complements and extends the work of the Latin American Microform Project (LAMP) , of which Bobst Library is a subscribing member. LAMP was founded in 1975 for the purpose of making available to scholars Latin American research materials in microformat, which would otherwise be unavailable. This includes materials which are inaccessible, in poor condition, or beyond the economic means of an individual institution. There are currently 33 member libraries, all of which have borrowing privileges for LAMP material housed at CRL's facilities. A meeting to report on projects-in-progress and to propose new projects is held once a year at SALALM .     Bobst Library's membership in the Center for Research Librarires is crucial for access to foreign dissertations; newspaper backfiles; British Foreign Office Microform Sets; and State Dept. Microform Sets.     The Library is a participant in the Latin American Demonstration Project of the AAU/ARL Global Resources Program together with 34 other libraries. Our participation requires 1) a commitment to provide access to selected Mexican and Argentine journals by maintaining subscriptions, providing timely ILL, and supplying contents pages for a journal database; and 2) A $7,000 comitment to Latin American Art Exhibit Catalogs.
