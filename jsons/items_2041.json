This dictionary  was developed by the Proteus Project at New York University under the auspices  of the Linguistic Data Consortium   (LDC). It contains exceptionally detailed syntactic information and is  now a widely-used lexical resource.   COMLEX Syntax, like other LDC products, is available for both research  and commercial use to LDC members with minimal legal restrictions on its  usage. The first version of COMLEX Syntax was delivered to the Linguistic  Data Consortium (LDC) in May, 1994, with extensions and corrections in  subsequent years. The final version, delivered in December, 1997,  is available as LDC catalog item LDC98L21 .  Interested users should contact the LDC to obtain this dictionary;   NYU is not permitted to distribute it directly.         The dictionary includes entries for approximately 21,000 nouns, 8,000  adjectives and 6,000 verbs, all of which are marked with a rich set of  syntactic features and complements. Nouns have 9 possible features and  9 possible complements; adjectives have 7 features and 14 complements;  verbs have 5 features and 92 complements; and adverbs have 11 positional  classes and 12 features. For 750 frequent verbs, there are an additional  4 possible features and 32 possible complements. Other entries identify  words as prepositions, cardinal numbers, etc. without further specification.  The noun, adjective and verb entries were created by a team of four linguistics  graduate students, working half-time for approximately one year. Each ELF  (enterer of lexical features) was provided with a menu-based entry program,  which is written in Lisp using the Garnet GUI package, and which provides  access to a concordance based on approximately 90 MB of text. Elves enter  features and complements for verbs based on: (1) the concordance; (2) hard  copy dictionaries; and (3) their individual knowledge.   Each lexical entry is organized as a typed feature structure,  using a Lisp-style notation which, can be mapped into other forms, e.g.  Prolog, SGML-marked text, etc. Each list consists of a type symbol followed  by zero or more keyword-value pairs. Each value may in turn be an atom,  a string, a list of strings, feature-value list, or a list of feature-value  lists. Key-words identify orthography (:orth) inflected forms (e.g., :plural,  :pastpart, etc.), features (:features), subcategorization/complements (:subc),  and other information. Subcategorization is mostly self-explanatory, e.g.,  verbs marked with \"np\" and \"part-np\" respectively take \"np\" and \"particle  + np\" complements. Features include \"apreq\" which is marked on adjectives  which can modify a numerically quantified NP, e.g., \"the above-mentioned  one hundred gorillas\" where \"above-mentioned\" modifies the group of one  hundred gorillas (each gorilla is not above-mentioned) and ntitle which  refer to nouns that occur as titles preceding names, e.g. \"Prof. Mary Fitzburg\".  We completed a Version 2 of COMLEX Syntax in August of 1995. The two most  significant changes were: (1) An improvement in the quality and coverage  of COMLEX as the result of our own quality checks as well as feedback from  users; and (2) The lexical entries for 750 common verbs now include a list  of 100 tags, where each tag consists of one feature or complement, the  name of the source (Brown Corpus, Wall Street Journal, etc.) and a pointer  to a corpus file. (For illustration purposes, the sample entry below lists  three tags rather than 100.) This corpus file is also available from the  LDC. The tagging effort was significant for gathering statistics on the  frequency of complements and features.   We completed Version 3 of COMLEX Syntax in December of 1997. This latest  version of COMLEX Syntax has been updated to include adverb classes.  We also added diacritics to foreign words, while retaining the unaccented  versions and performed various other updates to correct and supplement  our lexical entries.

The talks are given by students, faculty, and visiting scholars in the Tri-State Area who come to NYC and share their on-going research with our department.       As of Fall 2013, Syntax Brown Bags are usually held in the NYU linguistics department on Fridays, at\u00a0 noon , in Room 103 of 10 Washington Place \u00a0 (unless otherwise noted in the schedule below) . Talks are 60 minutes in length, followed by a 30 minute Q&amp;A period.       These Brown Bags are a good opportunity for speakers to discuss their research in a relaxed and informal setting with their interdepartmental colleagues and enjoy some light snacks.

It will be argued that the  verb/TAM-marker must c-command the nominal from which it receives its  feature values \u2013 a configuration dubbed upward valuation . Some prevalent arguments that agreement in phi-features requires the opposite configuration \u2013 downward valuation \u2013 will be evaluated, and shown to be inconclusive at best. Further data that can only be handled by upward valuation   of phi-features will then be presented and discussed. Finally, a new  (putative) generalization concerning phi-feature agreement at-a-distance  will be offered, and it will be argued that this generalization can  only be explained if downward valuation in phi-features is categorically disallowed.

On that view the  complement of modals specifies the satisfiers (and violators) (in roughy  the sense of Fine's truthmaker semantics) of the modal object, that is,  the situations or actions that satisfy or violate the modal object. The  view will be applied especially to various sorts of modal concord and  connections between modals and attitudinal and illocutionary predicates.

Oku's (1998) argument ellipsis,  where arguments can directly undergo ellipsis. However, Hoji (1998,  2003) and Tomioka (2003, 2014) argue that the data which is taken to  support the ellipsis view can/should be treated via deep anaphora, i.e.  pro. In this presentation, I show that Japanese missing arguments  actually exhibit mixed behavior of surface and deep anaphora based on  some traditional diagnostics, e.g. missing antecedent phenomena and  extraction (cf. Hankamer and Sag 1976, Sag and Hankamer 1984, Depiante  2000, Johnson 2001, Merchant 2013, among others). Then, I demonstrate  that the mixed behavior that Japanese missing arguments show can  uniformly be captured by (modified) LF-copying (cf. Thompson 2013,  2014), which in turn argues for such an ellipsis strategy in Japanese.  Furthermore, I explore a novel hybrid approach to Japanese missing  arguments where they are uniformly pro in overt syntax but can be  replaced by appropriate linguistic antecedents, if any, via (modified)  LF-copying, which is shown not only to account for the mixed behavior in  question but also to have some consequences for the cross-linguistic  difference regarding the availability of \"argument ellipsis\", distinct  behaviors of Japanese relative clauses and non-case-marked clefts, and  the distributional parallelism of pro and \"argument ellipsis\".

Indeed, Baker (1985) used Quechua as one of  his examples illustrating the Mirror Principle, building on  pathbreaking work on Quechua affix order by Muysken (1981).\u00a0 However,  Muysken (1981) also pointed out some cases which seemed problematic for  what became known as the Mirror Principle, and subsequent work has since  pointed out others (e.g. Muysken 1986; van de Kerke 1996).\u00a0 In this  talk, I will revisit these apparently problematic cases, and show that  they dissolve once the syntactic and semantic properties of the affixes  in question are better understood.\u00a0 In every case, a key part of the  solution will be refusing to take wordhood too seriously.

The  study is conducted in the light of Merchant\u2019s (2001, 2004, 2008)  [E]-feature-based approach according to which ellipsis is triggered by  an abstract [E]-feature that c-commands and dictates non-pronunciation  of a TP/IP complement as in (1). It is shown that in Basaa\u0301 and Tuki,  two related Bantu languages, sluicing is provoked in the c-domain by an  overt [E]-feature which dictates non-pronunciation of a c-commanded  TP/AgrSP complement (2). The [E]-feature which encodes either  evidentiality or alternative question and which is hosted under Evid,  the head of Evdentiality Phrase (EvidP) or Alt, the head of Alternative  Phrase (AltP), is preceded by the force, interrogative and focus markers  which are in turn hosted by force, the head of the force phrase  (ForceP, Int, the head of the interrogative phrase (IntP) and Foc the  head of the focus phrase (FocP) respectively. As portrayed in (3a-b),  the order of these functional morphemes which project different  functional projections provides a fine-grained characterization of the  clausal left periphery following (Rizzi 1997) and subsequent work.

While the assignment of dative to a subject seems to be tied to thematic interpretation (at least to some extent), accusative subjects have been argued to be either lexically idiosyncratic or derived syntactically by special syntactic features that are not otherwise needed.   In this talk, I take a close look at accusative subject constructions. Taking seriously the connections across morphology, semantics, and syntax, I argue that the study of these constructions leads to some important architectural conclusions:   \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u201cStructurally\u201d case-marked DPs are not frozen, and can in fact be forced to A-move, if the structural configuration is right. This necessitates a full dissociation of morphological case marking from DP licensing.   \u00b7 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  \u201cLexical idiosyncrasy\u201d is not a unified phenomenon; in particular, semantic idiosyncrasy and morphological idiosyncrasy are not listed in the same place.   My argument stems in particular from the analytical implications of what I will call the Accusative Subject Generalization (ASG):   (1) Accusative Subject Generalization : Accusative subjects in Icelandic are never thematic arguments of morphologically intransitive verbs.\u00a0   In fact, a sizeable subclass of accusative subject verbs are not only transitive in form, they are semantically idiomatic uses of otherwise-occurring transitive verbs. An illustration of this is given in (2), where we have the ordinary, transitive form of \u2018break\u2019 from a morphological perspective, and a special meaning of \u2018break\u2019 from a semantic perspective.

In general, I will propose that something special has to happen, syntactically, for an accusative DP to become a structural subject. It has to be c-commanded by a higher DP in order to get accusative case, but must somehow move past that DP to become a subject. In cases like (2), I propose that there is a silent external argument which has the syntax of a clitic (allowing movement past it) and the interpretation of a weather pronoun (triggering special interpretations of verbal roots). I will show that the predictions of this analysis are borne out, and that the ASG follows as a matter of course: the verbs are morphologically transitive because the morphology is reflecting the syntactic presence of the silent external argument.

An example exhibiting negative auxiliary  inversion is given in (1). (1) Didn't everybody go to the party. The  example is a declarative sentence with a sentence-initial negated  auxiliary. The phenomenon is constrained in several ways (Labov et al.,  1968 a.o.), one of which is in the types of subjects it allows. Definite  subjects such as proper names are not licit, as in (2). (2) *Didn't Jack go to the party. I  will give a more thorough characterization of the subject restriction  and argue in favor of accounting for it by revising the principle of  Scope Economy proposed by Fox (2000) to apply to overt, optional  movement. Since the analysis depends on negation, a head, gaining scopal  significance in its moved position, the phenomenon can be seen as  further evidence for the previously made observation that head movement  can exhibit semantic effects (Lechner, 2007; Roberts, 2010; Szabolcsi,  2010). I present two possible implementations for how the movement of  negation could be scopally significant.

These structures correspond to the familiar distinctions between weak and strong NPIs and between strict and non-strict NPIs.   In this talk, I analyze NPIs in Ewe and Serbian/Croatian in the framework of Collins and Postal 2014. I show that Ewe only possesses unary NEG NPIs (for DPs), while Serbian/Croatian possesses both unary NEG NPIs and binary NEG NPIs, and that they are distinguished morphologically. Finally, I give explanations for the differences in the distribution of NPIs between the three languages.  Overall, the results of this study provide cross-linguistic support for the claims made about the syntactic structure of English NPIs in Collins and Postal 2014.   January 30  Lotte Hendriks  (Meertens Instituut), 1:45pm   \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Knowledge of verb clusters (joint work with  Sjef Barbiers and Hans Bennis)   \u00a0  Speakers  are able to judge syntactic constructions that are not part of their  own language variety. When they are asked to rank a number of variants  of such a construction on a scale, this ranking turns out to be parallel  to the geographic frequency distribution of these variants. We consider  three possible explanations for this striking fact, based on (i)  processing, (ii) familiarity and (iii) the syntactic system. We argue  that only the third option can explain the behavior of the speakers.\u00a0  We  discuss two aspects of verb clusters that exhibit variation in the  Dutch dialects: the order of the verbs in the cluster and interruption  of the verb cluster by non-verbal material.  There  is much variation in the order of the verbs in the cluster in (1); (cf.  Barbiers 2005; SAND Volume II, Barbiers et al. 2008). While all  varieties of Dutch have verb cluster constructions, we find a clear  geographic distribution of different orderings across the language area,  with differences in frequency of occurrence.  Verb  cluster interruption shows a lot of geographical variation too, here  with respect to the type of constituent that can interrupt the cluster,  varying from particles (moet op-bellen \u2018must up-call\u2019) to various types  of arguments (moet een schuur bouwen \u2018must a barn built\u2019) and adverbs  (moet vroeg opstaan \u2018must early rise\u2019)\u00a0 (cf. SAND Volume II). Two  factors turn out to be relevant, the complexity of the interrupting  constituent and the position in the syntactic hierarchy (in the sense of  Cinque 1999) where this element is base-generated (Hendriks 2014).  The  clear geographic distribution of the various variants of these two  constructions makes it possible to investigate if speakers have  intuitions on variants that occur in language varieties different from  their own.  We  find a high degree of correspondence between the speakers\u2019 rankings and  the number of locations in the Dutch language area that have a  particular construction. (i) verb cluster orders that are more frequent  amongst the varieties of Dutch are ranked higher and (ii) speakers in  areas where verb cluster interruptions are only used sporadically and  with many restrictions, nevertheless have intuitions that correspond to  the observed syntactic patterns in the Flemish varieties of Dutch.  We  demonstrate that processing preferences and familiarity with the  phenomenon cannot account for the observed correspondence between  speakers\u2019 intuitions of a construction and that constructions\u2019  geographic distribution. Potentially, the intuitions follow from  properties of the grammatical system.

Case alternations are found in a number of Slavic and Uralic languages, attracting the most attention with regards to numerals. In Polish, numerals 5+ (5-10, 100) trigger genitive case assignment in structural case positions, but appear to show case agreement in inherent case positions, as in (1). Negation shows similar properties, triggering genitive case on structural accusative objects, but not on inherently cased objects, as in (2).

I argue that Polish numerals are semi-lexical, based on various morphological and syntactic properties, and show how this in combination with a treatment of inherent case as a PP-case can capture the patterns in (1) and (2). I further consider the implications of this treatment of inherent case for systems of case and agreement in other languages, operating under the assumption that if PPs are opaque to case assignment processes, then they should also be opaque to other processes, such as agreement. I explore how this analysis might account for certain differences in patterns of agreement across languages.

I argue that both forms are verbal and are related via restructuring following similar analyses of wanna contraction. However, liketa is different from wanna   in that it places unique aspectual restrictions on its complements.  Specifically, it requires that the verb appearing immediately to the  right be marked with past participle morphology for felicitous  interpretation. A comparison of liketa and liked to reveals that both are verbal. Liketa has many hallmark properties of restructuring predicates. In fact, it shares many properties with wanna contraction, another contractions argued to be an example of restructuring in English. I then analyze liketa   in a mono-clausal approach to restructuring (Wurmbrand 2001). This  analysis leads to a particular view of auxiliary insertion in  restructuring contexts. I then consider dialect variation among grammars  which allow slightly different syntactic constraints on the usage of liketa .  Finally, I sketch out an alternative bi-clausal restructuring account  in order to compare the consequences of two prominent theories of  restructuring verbs.

Ever since the typological studies of languages initiated by  Greenberg (1963), a lot of attention has been paid to the high  correlation between the order of the direct object with regard to the  verb, and the word order options in other phrases. For instance,  postpositions, sentence-final interrogative markers, postverbal  auxiliaries, preverbal and pronominal modifiers tend to co-occur in OV  languages. The second line of research relates head directionality to  other linguistic properties (e.g., overt\u00a0 wh -movement,\u00a0ergative  Case marking, rigid scope), and attempt to reduce these properties\u00a0to a  word order related principle (Kayne 1994, Mahajan 1997, Fox &amp;  Pesetsky 2009). In the spirit of the second line, I will present a  series of linguistic phenomena, some of which are less familiar than  others, that all involve non-local dependencies between two elements and  that have been found almost exclusively in OV languages. The goal of  this project is to relate these seemingly independent phenomena to each  other, and eventually to the OV word order.

We see that ecco can co-occur with a noun phrase  (1a), a finite clause (1b), and a pseudo-relative (1c), thus resembling  perception verbs, which are exemplified in (2):  (1) a. Ecco Maria.  \u2018Here\u2019s Maria.\u2019  b. Ecco Maria che perde la pazienza.  \u2018Here\u2019s Maria losing her patience.\u2019  c.

Here I  will pursue a different strategy and seek a better understanding of  ecco-sentences like those in (1) by focusing on their similarities with  locative ci-sentences, like those in (3):  (3) a. C\u2019\u00e8 Maria.  \u2018Maria is here.\u2019  b. C\u2019\u00e8 Maria che perde la pazienza.  \u2018Here\u2019s Maria losing her patience.\u2019  c. C\u2019\u00e8 che Maria perde la pazienza.  \u2018What\u2019s happening is that Maria is losing her patience.\u2019  I  will argue that both types of sentences contain a small clause with a  locative predicate, though they differ both in structural terms and in  the nature of the locative element.

Argument structure and existential propositions at the syntax-discourse interface  Abstract In  this talk I'll show that recent work from two independent lines of  research can shed light on an asymmetry in the interpretation of  indefinite DP subjects of intransitive sentences. I'll argue that one  type of intransitive sentence has the structure and meaning of an  existential proposition. As is well-known, one discourse function of  existential there sentences is to introduce new entities into a  discourse. I'll show that this function can be explained by an approach  based on the notion of referential anchoring (von Heusinger 2002 and  following), and that the insights of referential anchoring are  compatible with recent work on the context-dependence of existential  sentences (Partee &amp; Borschev 2002; Francez 2007; McCloskey, to  appear). From these two lines of research, I argue that sentences with  existential predications have a built-in referential anchor that other  sentences lack, and that this anchor is what allows existential  sentences to serve the important discourse function that they do. This  analysis predicts that other types of sentences are able to serve the  discourse function of existential sentences, so long as they have the  relevant syntactic and semantic existential predication. I'll argue that  a subset of unaccusative VPs has such a predication and that we can see  these effects at the interface with discourse.

In this talk, I propose that Serbian, despite having rich verbal morphology, actually lacks true temporal morphology, and, consequently, lacks a TP layer. Exemplifying it on two seemingly unrelated phenomena, i.e. availability of VP-ellipsis under finiteness mismatches and aspectual distribution in aspectual tenses, i.e. Aorist and Imperfectum, I argue that a TP-less analysis of Serbian can account for verbal behavior in these cases. Furthermore, cross-linguistic differences regarding these two phenomena can be accounted for under a parametric variation in the presence of a TP-layer, i.e. its presence versus its absence in a language.     \u00a0 Further preliminary investigations concern co-occurrence of perfective aspect and past tense, and perfective aspect and future. Regarding the former, a cross-linguistic tendency is for perfective aspect and past tense not to co-occur, i.e. perfective usually expresses a completed event, making the use of past redundant in languages which have overt realization of perfective. In Serbian, however, forms that have been traditionally analyzed as past seem to equally easily occur with either imperfective or perfective. In the light of this, I intend to question the status of past tense in Serbian. Finally, I propose that the absence of TP does not present a problem for temporal interpretations, since those can be alternatively derived by the means of perfective and imperfective aspect, and aspectual component Perfect.

In this talk, I argue that all instances of predicate fronting with verb doubling in Krachi are characterized by a form of parallel chain formation (Chomsky 2008) in which different probes (Foc and T) target the same goal (V) and only the heads of the two resulting chains are realized at PF (i.e. the default chain resolution strategy). \u00a0 In this way, Krachi predicate focus provides additional support for analyses like Kandybowicz 2008 and Aboh &amp; Dyakonova 2009 that attempt to derive verb doubling from narrow syntactic mechanisms like parallel chain formation rather than multiple copy spell-out at PF. \u00a0 The interesting wrinkle in the case of Krachi is that although different probes may target the same goal (i.e. V), they do not always target the same copy of that goal. \u00a0 I show that all three copies of V scattered throughout the verb phrase may be targeted by the Foc probe, giving rise to three distinct ways of fronting the predicate. \u00a0 Despite the fact that two of these three probe-goal relations violate considerations of  minimal search , there appears to be no wrong way to front a predicate in Krachi.

Allegedly, compositional accounts of various  scope-taking elements are either problematic or require nontrivial  theoretical commitments once events are introduced (as suggested by\u00a0 Beaver and Condoravdi (2007) for quantification, \u00a0 Krifka (1989) for negation, and Lasersohn (1995, chapter 14) for conjunction).\u00a0     I suggest a novel perspective on event semantics  that overcomes these difficulties. The main innovation is that the event  quantifier is part of the lexical entry of the verb. The resulting  framework combines with standard treatments of scope-taking elements in a  well-behaved way. It is compatible with simple and intuitive accounts  of the syntax-semantics interface of quantification, negation and  conjunction. This result is relevant to syntacticians and semanticists  who are interested in the extent to which a commitment to events favors  various analyses of scope-taking expressions, or\u00a0who would simply like  to use events without taking sides in ongoing semantic debates.     The talk summarizes recent NASSLLI and\u00a0 ESSLLI \u00a0courses ( lecture notes here ) and previews a planned Fall 2015 course at NYU. A companion paper \u00a0is  under review at Linguistics &amp; Philosophy. A dynamic extension that  includes ideas from Simon Charlow's recent NYU\u00a0dissertation is\u00a0 in preparation . Roger Schwarzschild and I are currently exploring the interaction\u00a0of this system with recent work \u00a0of mine on distributivity in algebraic semantics, which will be at the focus of this year's\u00a0 mereology seminar \u00a0on Nov 4 and 11 .    The talk will feature a demonstration of Version 2.0 of the lambda calculator ,\u00a0which Dylan Bumford and I updated over the summers of 2013 and 2014, thanks to a NYU CDCF grant \u00a0and departmental matching funds.

Contrary to Lexicalist approaches to  inflectional paradigms, we show that systematic paradigm gaps in these  languages have their source in other parts of the grammar. For Hebrew,  we demonstrate that the lack of synthetic non-finite passive forms is  not a result of competition with their periphrastic counterparts. For  Latin, we revisit previous analyses of the passive (Embick 2000;  Kiparsky 2005) and show that a locality-sensitive, item-and-arrangement  approach (Halle and Marantz 1993) is superior both empirically and  conceptually to a theory that generates forms ina putative lexicon and  has them compete against each other. Paradigm gaps are thus shown to be  the result of syntactic structure building.
