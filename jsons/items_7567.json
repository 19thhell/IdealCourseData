Gallatin students please note: this course fulfills four units of the Interdisciplinary Seminar core requirement.          Course Description          This travel course examines urban development in the postcolonial global South through the lens of cities in Senegal, West Africa. Like elsewhere across the global South, Senegal is rapidly becoming urban. This process implies a host of important transformations and challenges for development, the environment, and the socio-political lives of city-dwellers. Owing to the country\u2019s particular development trajectory, long history of urbanization, and important legacy as one of Africa\u2019s strongest democracies, Senegal provides an especially fascinating place to examine these dynamics and grapple with their implications for urbanism in the global South and beyond.   Rejecting the language of crisis, chaos, and exception that is so often used to characterize urbanization in the global South, the course provides theoretically and experientially informed perspectives on the way postcolonial cities work as well as the challenges that remain. Though we will draw on readings from across the global South, the course will focus on the dynamic intersections of development, environment, and social movements in Senegal in light of the country\u2019s particular history, geography, culture, and politics.     Specifically, the course will be based Senegal\u2019s capital city, Dakar, but will include overnight trips to the other important Senegalese cities of Saint Louis (the colonial capital of French West African) and Touba (the holy city of Senegal's Islamic Mouride brotherhood) to compare the form and function of these alternative urban histories and development strategies. Through a combination of course readings, classroom lectures, tours, walks, and field visits, we will explore the legacies of colonialism and unpack a number of key contemporary debates and challenges faced by urban planners and city residents. Within Dakar, specific daytrips will include: Goree Island, the municipal garbage dump, a traditional fishing village, and a hip hop community center Through these lectures and fieldtrips, we will be exposed to multiple challenges and approaches to development from a broad variety of actors, including municipal governments, NGOs, and grassroots community-based organizations.     The class is taught in English and meets daily. Group field visits occur throughout the week and on weekends. Students are required to utilize accommodations arranged by Gallatin. They will live in a hotel for part of the program, and will also spend up to one week in a home-stay with a Senegalese family. Survival Wolof and French language training will be offered at the beginning of the program.     Students are required to fly as a group on roundtrip airfare purchased by Gallatin. The flight leaves NYC departing on Jan. 4 and returns to NYC on Jan. 23.

Like elsewhere across the global South, Senegal is rapidly becoming urban. This process implies a host of important transformations and challenges for development, the environment, and the socio-political lives of city-dwellers. Owing to the country\u2019s particular development trajectory, long history of urbanization, and important legacy as one of Africa\u2019s strongest democracies, Senegal provides an especially fascinating place to examine these dynamics and grapple with their implications for urbanism in the global South and beyond.   Rejecting the language of crisis, chaos, and exception that is so often used to characterize urbanization in the global South, the course provides theoretically and experientially informed perspectives on the way postcolonial cities work as well as the challenges that remain. Though we will draw on readings from across the global South, the course will focus on the dynamic intersections of development, environment, and social movements in Senegal in light of the country\u2019s particular history, geography, culture, and politics.     Specifically, the course will be based Senegal\u2019s capital city, Dakar, but will include overnight trips to the other important Senegalese cities of Saint Louis (the colonial capital of French West African) and Touba (the holy city of Senegal's Islamic Mouride brotherhood) to compare the form and function of these alternative urban histories and development strategies. Through a combination of course readings, classroom lectures, tours, walks, and field visits, we will explore the legacies of colonialism and unpack a number of key contemporary debates and challenges faced by urban planners and city residents. Within Dakar, specific daytrips will include: Goree Island, the municipal garbage dump, a traditional fishing village, and a hip hop community center Through these lectures and fieldtrips, we will be exposed to multiple challenges and approaches to development from a broad variety of actors, including municipal governments, NGOs, and grassroots community-based organizations.     The class is taught in English and meets daily. Group field visits occur throughout the week and on weekends. Students are required to utilize accommodations arranged by Gallatin. They will live in a hotel for part of the program, and will also spend up to one week in a home-stay with a Senegalese family. Survival Wolof and French language training will be offered at the beginning of the program.     Students are required to fly as a group on roundtrip airfare purchased by Gallatin. The flight leaves NYC departing on Jan. 4 and returns to NYC on Jan. 23.

Description       Application : http://gallatin.nyu.edu/utilities/forms/winter_travel.html For more information : http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/global/travelcourses/SenegalPostcolonialUrbanisms.html Description : This travel course examines urban development in the postcolonial global South through the lens of cities in Senegal, West Africa. Like elsewhere across the global South, Senegal is rapidly becoming urban. This process implies a host of important transformations and challenges for development, the environment, and the socio-political lives of city-dwellers. Owing to the country\u2019s particular development trajectory, long history of urbanization, and important legacy as one of Africa\u2019s strongest democracies, Senegal provides an especially fascinating place to examine these dynamics and grapple with their implications for urbanism in the global South and beyond. This course will be based in Senegal\u2019s capital city, Dakar, but will include overnight trips to the other important Senegalese cities of Saint Louis (the colonial capital of French West Africa) and Touba (Senegal\u2019s Islamic Mecca) to compare the form and function of these alternative urban histories and development strategies. Through a combination of course readings, classroom lectures, tours, walks, and field visits, we will explore the legacies of colonialism and unpack a number of key contemporary debates and challenges faced by urban planners and city residents.

DHS serves both to recognize excellent Gallatin students and to enrich their experiences at NYU.   Members participate in academic seminars and cultural activities with the deans and faculty members of Gallatin. Faculty members also facilitate career networking with Gallatin alumni and mentor students on career and graduate school goals. Members have not only shown excellence in their academic work, but have contributed significantly to the Gallatin, NYU, and New York City communities through their commitment to community service.          Year-long Program   Throughout the academic year, DHS members explore a particular theme through bi-weekly evening meetings. The majority of DHS activities take place during this time, although some activities such as dinners, performances, and overnight trips may occur at other times. DHS members must attend and participate in all DHS functions.        Examples of DHS Activities:          Programs on topics ranging from globalization to the information revolution, and from the intellectual autobiographies of faculty to the meaning of interdisciplinarity   Walking tours of Little India in Queens and Chinatown in Manhattan   Visits to museums, dance performances, musical performances, and other cultural events          International and Domestic Travel        DHS members join a Gallatin faculty member and administrator to explore a particular scholarly theme through international travel over Spring Break. Upon return, group members prepare a project based on their explorations and share it with the Gallatin community. The theme for 2014-2015 will be announced after the application process is completed.
