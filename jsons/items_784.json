Sheftel-Gomes  Open to 3L and 2L students  Maximum of 8 students   Spring semester  5 credits*  No prerequisites or co-requisites.         Course Description   The focus of this clinic clinic is the provision of civil legal services to grassroots community organizing groups that engage in a variety of community development, economic justice and social justice efforts. Students in the clinic will learn about \u201cmovement lawyering\u201d and the benefits and challenges of lawyering in partnership and collaboration with the communities they work in. Students will learn more about the different roles that lawyers can that lawyers can play in supporting campaigns led by communities to advance social change. Working with groups that are organizing low-income communities in New York City, students perform their fieldwork with attorneys from the Community Development Project (CDP) of the Urban Justice Center, and provide legal services to CDP\u2019s clients throughout New York City focusing on workers\u2019 rights, affordable housing, consumer protection, and capacity building for community based organizations. As part of the fieldwork, students will work on litigation cases as well as research projects that help support and strengthen grassroots organizations\u2019 organizing and advocacy efforts. Students may also work on transactional cases for CDP\u2019s capacity building practice in which they offer legal advice and assistance to grassroots organizations in a variety of areas, such as incorporating an organization, drafting corporate governance documents, applying for tax exempt status, forming of worker cooperatives, or negotiating land use and community benefit agreements.   Fieldwork   The fieldwork for this clinic will be primarily or entirely conducted with CDP. Clinic students will have the opportunity to be involved in a litigation or transactional case as well as a legal research matter that supports the ongoing work of CDP and the organizations it supports. The majority of the fieldwork will consist of litigation cases and related matters, such as drafting a demand letter on behalf of workers to obtain the unpaid wages owed by their employer.     The litigation matter will be in the areas of workers\u2019 rights, affordable housing, and consumer justice. CDP uses litigation as a way to support grassroots organizing efforts in New York City. Litigation is developed in partnership with the organizations and usually arises out of issues facing their communities. The workers\u2019 rights cases typically involve minimum wage and overtime violations, workplace discrimination, and retaliatory discharge. Plaintiffs in these cases could be workers in the restaurant, construction, nail salon, garment, food distribution, and domestic industries. The tenants\u2019 rights cases involve representing tenant associations organized by community-based organizations in litigation to combat landlord abandonment, to seek repairs to bring buildings into compliance with the housing code, and to combat harassment and retaliation by landlords.   The consumer justice cases are varied, but often involve defending a client against an action by a creditor in court and representing clients on matters such as identity theft and unlawful debt collection abuse. Students\u2019 litigation work will likely entail joining an existing team of lawyers working on an ongoing case, and will provide an opportunity to work directly with clients, strategize with co-counsel, research legal issues that arise, draft documents, and prepare for and observe depositions and court proceedings.     In transactional matters, students will have the opportunity to counsel and work directly with organizational clients, in addition to experience drafting documents for a grassroots organization on non-profit incorporation, corporate governance, tax exempt status, formation of worker cooperatives, or land use and community benefit agreements.       Students will work out of CDP\u2019s offices and are expected to spend at least ten hours a week at CDP\u2019s offices. Direct interaction with the grassroots organizations\u2019 staff and members will be an integral component of the fieldwork.   The Seminar   The seminar will meet weekly on Tuesday from 4:20 \u2013 6:10 p.m. at CDP\u2019s office located at 123 William Street, 16th Floor. (The main office of the Urban Justice Center is located at 40 Rector Street).   Classes will be participatory in nature, and students will be expected to discuss assigned readings and give presentations, discuss their fieldwork, prepare for and engage in simulations intended to sharpen practical lawyering skills, and write reflections throughout the semester.   The seminar will integrate substantive areas of law, including workers\u2019 rights, tenants\u2019 rights, consumer justice, and capacity building for organizations through the readings, class discussion, and simulations on the following topics: lawyers as resource allies for social change; law and organizing; ethical issues in group representation and movement lawyering; client interviewing and cultural competencies; case theory and client narrative; legal support to workers centers and tenant associations; legislative advocacy; written &amp; oral advocacy; representing community-based organizations; and discovery disputes and depositions, including protecting clients in litigation from harassing discovery.     About the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center   The Community Development Project (CDP) at the Urban Justice Center strengthens the impact of grassroots organizations in New York City\u2019s low-income and other excluded communities. We partner with community organizations to win legal cases, publish community-driven research reports, assist with the formation of new organizations and cooperatives, and provide technical and transactional assistance in support of their work towards social justice.   CDP adheres to a theory of change where short-term and individual successes help build the capacity and power of our community partners, who in turn can have longer-term impact on policies, laws and systems that affect their communities. We leverage short-term successes such as winning cases and publishing reports to build the capacity of our partner organizations, increase public awareness of the issues they are organizing around, and help achieve victories for their organizing campaigns.   This enables our community partners to create systemic change through law and policy reform, increase political power in low-income and excluded communities, and change abusive and exploitative practices affecting their communities. CDP works with many organizations throughout New York City, such as the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, Mirabal Sisters, Fifth Avenue Committee, Chhaya CDC, Communities for Safe Apartments (CASA), Mothers on the Move (MOM), CAAAV, the National Mobilization Against Sweatshops (NMASS), the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York (ROC-NY), Domestic Workers United (DWU), New Immigrant Community Empowerment (NICE), and numerous tenants\u2019 associations. More information about CDP\u2019s work can be found at www.cdp.urbanjustice.org .     Application Procedure   Students interested in applying for the clinic should submit the standard application, resume, and transcript online through CAMS. Selection of students is not based on interviews. However, Professors Tai and Sheftel-Gomes (who are both currently co-teaching the clinic) will meet with applicants in groups in order to provide a more complete description of the clinic and to answer questions.

Course Description   The focus of this clinic clinic is the provision of civil legal services to grassroots community organizing groups that engage in a variety of community development, economic justice and social justice efforts. Students in the clinic will learn about \u201cmovement lawyering\u201d and the benefits and challenges of lawyering in partnership and collaboration with the communities they work in. Students will learn more about the different roles that lawyers can that lawyers can play in supporting campaigns led by communities to advance social change. Working with groups that are organizing low-income communities in New York City, students perform their fieldwork with attorneys from the Community Development Project (CDP) of the Urban Justice Center, and provide legal services to CDP\u2019s clients throughout New York City focusing on workers\u2019 rights, affordable housing, consumer protection, and capacity building for community based organizations. As part of the fieldwork, students will work on litigation cases as well as research projects that help support and strengthen grassroots organizations\u2019 organizing and advocacy efforts. Students may also work on transactional cases for CDP\u2019s capacity building practice in which they offer legal advice and assistance to grassroots organizations in a variety of areas, such as incorporating an organization, drafting corporate governance documents, applying for tax exempt status, forming of worker cooperatives, or negotiating land use and community benefit agreements.   Fieldwork   The fieldwork for this clinic will be primarily or entirely conducted with CDP. Clinic students will have the opportunity to be involved in a litigation or transactional case as well as a legal research matter that supports the ongoing work of CDP and the organizations it supports. The majority of the fieldwork will consist of litigation cases and related matters, such as drafting a demand letter on behalf of workers to obtain the unpaid wages owed by their employer.     The litigation matter will be in the areas of workers\u2019 rights, affordable housing, and consumer justice. CDP uses litigation as a way to support grassroots organizing efforts in New York City. Litigation is developed in partnership with the organizations and usually arises out of issues facing their communities. The workers\u2019 rights cases typically involve minimum wage and overtime violations, workplace discrimination, and retaliatory discharge. Plaintiffs in these cases could be workers in the restaurant, construction, nail salon, garment, food distribution, and domestic industries. The tenants\u2019 rights cases involve representing tenant associations organized by community-based organizations in litigation to combat landlord abandonment, to seek repairs to bring buildings into compliance with the housing code, and to combat harassment and retaliation by landlords.   The consumer justice cases are varied, but often involve defending a client against an action by a creditor in court and representing clients on matters such as identity theft and unlawful debt collection abuse. Students\u2019 litigation work will likely entail joining an existing team of lawyers working on an ongoing case, and will provide an opportunity to work directly with clients, strategize with co-counsel, research legal issues that arise, draft documents, and prepare for and observe depositions and court proceedings.     In transactional matters, students will have the opportunity to counsel and work directly with organizational clients, in addition to experience drafting documents for a grassroots organization on non-profit incorporation, corporate governance, tax exempt status, formation of worker cooperatives, or land use and community benefit agreements.       Students will work out of CDP\u2019s offices and are expected to spend at least ten hours a week at CDP\u2019s offices. Direct interaction with the grassroots organizations\u2019 staff and members will be an integral component of the fieldwork.   The Seminar   The seminar will meet weekly on Tuesday from 4:20 \u2013 6:10 p.m. at CDP\u2019s office located at 123 William Street, 16th Floor. (The main office of the Urban Justice Center is located at 40 Rector Street).   Classes will be participatory in nature, and students will be expected to discuss assigned readings and give presentations, discuss their fieldwork, prepare for and engage in simulations intended to sharpen practical lawyering skills, and write reflections throughout the semester.   The seminar will integrate substantive areas of law, including workers\u2019 rights, tenants\u2019 rights, consumer justice, and capacity building for organizations through the readings, class discussion, and simulations on the following topics: lawyers as resource allies for social change; law and organizing; ethical issues in group representation and movement lawyering; client interviewing and cultural competencies; case theory and client narrative; legal support to workers centers and tenant associations; legislative advocacy; written &amp; oral advocacy; representing community-based organizations; and discovery disputes and depositions, including protecting clients in litigation from harassing discovery.     About the Community Development Project at the Urban Justice Center   The Community Development Project (CDP) at the Urban Justice Center strengthens the impact of grassroots organizations in New York City\u2019s low-income and other excluded communities. We partner with community organizations to win legal cases, publish community-driven research reports, assist with the formation of new organizations and cooperatives, and provide technical and transactional assistance in support of their work towards social justice.   CDP adheres to a theory of change where short-term and individual successes help build the capacity and power of our community partners, who in turn can have longer-term impact on policies, laws and systems that affect their communities. We leverage short-term successes such as winning cases and publishing reports to build the capacity of our partner organizations, increase public awareness of the issues they are organizing around, and help achieve victories for their organizing campaigns.   This enables our community partners to create systemic change through law and policy reform, increase political power in low-income and excluded communities, and change abusive and exploitative practices affecting their communities. CDP works with many organizations throughout New York City, such as the Chinese Staff and Workers Association, Mirabal Sisters, Fifth Avenue Committee, Chhaya CDC, Communities for Safe Apartments (CASA), Mothers on the Move (MOM), CAAAV, the National Mobilization Against Sweatshops (NMASS), the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York (ROC-NY), Domestic Workers United (DWU), New Immigrant Community Empowerment (NICE), and numerous tenants\u2019 associations. More information about CDP\u2019s work can be found at www.cdp.urbanjustice.org .

Education and Social Policy Faculty Members Publish \"Not Just for Poor Kids: The Impact of Universal Free School Breakfast on Meal Participation and Student Outcomes\"    Education and Social Policy Faculty Member, Sean Corcoran, Publishes Paper on School Choices and Placements of Low-Achieving Students       Program Description    The M.A. program in Education and Social Policy addresses the growing demand for professionals who can use up-to-date methods, data, and research results to formulate, implement, and evaluate education policies, ranging from the national No Child Left Behind Act to local or state policies such as New York City's Children First initiative. As the national and international concern with the quality of education grows, local, state and federal education agencies, think tanks, and nonprofit organizations are seeking individuals with the skills and knowledge to help craft education reforms that improve the effectiveness and fairness of educational outcomes.    Based in the social science disciplines of economics and sociology , the program teaches you to use statistics, large datasets, and research designs to analyze education policies for grades K-12 and higher education.     The curriculum is designed to assure that you master appropriate analytical methods as well as develop knowledge of issues in a specific education policy area, such as higher education, race and class, international education, or K-12 education issues. No previous knowledge of education policy or statistics is required.    The degree is distinguished from other master&rsquo;s degrees in education policy by its strong emphasis on using quantitative methods to ascertain causal effects of programs and policies. You begin your studies with a first course in statistics and progress through more rigorous analytical courses, including regression and econometrics. The sequence of methods courses culminates in a final directed group research project in which groups produce a professional study of an educational intervention or policy of their choosing.    Throughout the course of study, you gain experience:       in working with large longitudinal education databases    with using economic and sociological principles to analyze K-16 education, and    with principles of management, planning, and policy making in the public and nonprofit sectors, which draw on the expertise of faculty in NYU&rsquo;s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service .       The curriculum places a strong emphasis on understanding the context, purpose, unintended effects, and finally the actual impact of alternative education policies and programs. You will use elective choices, which you&rsquo;ll choose in consultation with your adviser, to gain knowledge of policy issues.    Students gain experience through the required Capstone course, as well, where they work in teams to design and perform a research study. Projects are designed and written for a particular &ldquo;clientele&rdquo; in the policy community. Throughout the tenure of their capstone project, students are expected to consult with faculty who have relevant expertise in appropriate fields of research specialization. See right for an example of a capstone poster.    Graduates are prepared to work in a wide variety of organizations that have a role in policymaking and implementation in the education area, including local, state and federal education departments, foundations, think tanks, and consulting, grant-giving and public-relations departments in selected private organizations. Students in the Education and Social Policy program learn about education policy in New York City--one of the best urban laboratories in the nation. Through this experience, alumni of the Education and Social Policy program are prepared to work in education policy throughout the country, and even in major cities in other nations like China and Japan.    View and download our PDF Brochure to learn more about the Education and Social Policy Program.     Mission Statement    The M.A. program in Education and Social Policy prepares graduates to become professionals who use statistics, large datasets, and research designs to formulate and evaluate education policies in grades kindergarten through twelve and higher education.    The program provides an opportunity to specialize in specific areas of education policy, such as higher education, race and class, international education, or K-12 education issues.    Student Learning Objectives       Students will apply principles of economics and sociology to formulate and analyze K-12 and higher education policies.    Students will conduct descriptive and inferential statistical analyses using large longitudinal education databases to interpret and identify causal effects of programs and policies and to apply conclusions to make policy recommendations.    Students will understand the policies already implemented as well as needs for additional policies in their chosen areas. They will be able to participate in quantitative studies to further evaluate existing policies and to provide evidence on the possible effects of new policies.       Other Options to Study Education and Policy in Steinhardt    In addition to the M.A. Program in Education and Social Policy, the Steinhardt School offers students two other options to study education and policy and to prepare for a career in this field. We encourage you to explore these options further to find the program that best matches your personal interests and career goals.
