To meet this challenge, we have created two dual certification programs that are at the cutting edge of the profession:       Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education (Grades 1-6)    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education (Birth-Grade 2)       This design recognizes that whether our graduates choose to work in general education settings, special education settings, or inclusive settings, they need to share a set of common understandings. Thus, our students acquire a firm knowledge base in human development and variability in development. They acquire knowledge and skills for providing enriching, child-centered educational environments and learn how to adapt those environments to meet the needs of the diverse students in their classes.    Graduates from these dual certification programs share visions for their students. They acquire the collaborative skills to realize those visions with teachers, parents, and other education and health professionals. In short, NYU's integrated, dual certification programs model the process its graduates will use throughout their careers.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.

Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professionals, as well as professionals from related disciplines to provide learning opportunities for children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of settings.    Focusing on How Children Learn and Develop    Our Teacher Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education within the Department of Teaching and Learning is an urban-centered and field-based program that gives a thorough command of an integrated curriculum grounded in a deep understanding of children's growth and development, with an emphasis on human variability. You will have practical experience in the field, and you will gain mastery of the various content areas of the elementary curriculum (mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts), as well as learn to create and adapt learning environments that allow all children to grow to their maximum potential.    Strong Emphasis on the Liberal Arts    A solid foundation in a wide range of liberal arts subjects and expertise in one area of the liberal arts are critical to your development as a first-rate teacher. With our liberal arts core and the 30-point liberal arts concentration required by New York State for teacher certification, our baccalaureate program ensures that you will receive the best possible preparation to be a teacher. For your liberal arts concentration, choose from such areas as history, literature, science, mathematics, and from many other offerings in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the College of Arts and Science. Your knowledge of teaching children will be supported by courses in human development, educational foundations, and inquiry-based education.    Study Abroad    We strongly encourage study abroad for all students. London, UK and Accra, Ghana are our academic partner sites. We offer the required course Human Development through NYU in London and NYU-Accra for teacher education students. The course includes weekly observations in British or Ghanaian schools and classrooms for first-hand learning in the local context. Students typically combine this course with three liberal-arts electives for an unforgettable semester-long experience.    Students may also spend a semester abroad at one of NYU's many other study abroad sites .    Student Activities    From your first year, your involvement in departmental activities will round out your learning. You may join the Special Education Club, which is a chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children. You may also take advantage of various departmental seminars and social activities concerned with the education of children. Students are also encouraged to join Steinhardt's Undergraduate Student Government.    Education in Comparative Perspectives    You are strongly encouraged to spend a semester abroad in one of NYU's many study abroad sites in Paris, Madrid, Florence, Berlin, London, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Prague, or Ghana. NYU in London offers a special course for teacher education students that takes them to British schools and classrooms for observation and firsthand learning.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.        Senior Honors    Qualified seniors who wish to pursue a guided research in an area of educational   inquiry may participate in a special yearlong seminar called Honors Research   in Teaching and Learning. Working with the faculty instructor, students are   guided through the process of selecting a topic of inquiry, developing research   questions, choosing and implementing appropriate methodologies, building   outlines, developing bibliographies and writing literature reviews, and preparing   drafts. The seminar meets regularly during the first semester as students   develop their questions and projects. During the second semester, each student   works independently on a project under the direction of his or her own faculty   supervisor, with whom the student holds regular meetings. Students meet periodically   with their seminar classmates to share their research and findings as they   refine and complete their final projects.

To meet this challenge, we have created two dual certification programs that are at the cutting edge of the profession:       Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education (Grades 1-6)    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education (Birth-Grade 2)       This design recognizes that whether our graduates choose to work in general education settings, special education settings, or inclusive settings, they need to share a set of common understandings. Thus, our students acquire a firm knowledge base in human development and variability in development. They acquire knowledge and skills for providing enriching, child-centered educational environments and learn how to adapt those environments to meet the needs of the diverse students in their classes.    Graduates from these dual certification programs share visions for their students. They acquire the collaborative skills to realize those visions with teachers, parents, and other education and health professionals. In short, NYU's integrated, dual certification programs model the process its graduates will use throughout their careers.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.     NYU Steinhardt Graduates in Education Ranked among the Highest Paid by USA Today      How to Apply      asd nest support project at NYU Steinhardt          BS Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education     Opening Doors and Supporting the Diverse Needs of Learners    The Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education is designed to prepare teachers for infant-toddler, pre-K, or grade K-2 general education or special education programs. Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professionals, as well as professionals from related disciplines to provide learning opportunities for children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of settings.    Focusing on How Children Learn and Develop    Our Teacher Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education within the Department of Teaching and Learning is an urban-centered and field-based program that gives a thorough command of an integrated curriculum grounded in a deep understanding of children's growth and development, with an emphasis on human variability. You will have practical experience in the field, and you will gain mastery of the various content areas of the elementary curriculum (mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts), as well as learn to create and adapt learning environments that allow all children to grow to their maximum potential.    Strong Emphasis on the Liberal Arts    A solid foundation in a wide range of liberal arts subjects and expertise in one area of the liberal arts are critical to your development as a first-rate teacher. With our liberal arts core and the 30-point liberal arts concentration required by New York State for teacher certification, our baccalaureate program ensures that you will receive the best possible preparation to be a teacher. For your liberal arts concentration, choose from such areas as history, literature, science, mathematics, and from many other offerings in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the College of Arts and Science. Your knowledge of teaching children will be supported by courses in human development, educational foundations, and inquiry-based education.    Study Abroad    We strongly encourage study abroad for all students. London, UK and Accra, Ghana are our academic partner sites. We offer the required course Human Development through NYU in London and NYU-Accra for teacher education students. The course includes weekly observations in British or Ghanaian schools and classrooms for first-hand learning in the local context. Students typically combine this course with three liberal-arts electives for an unforgettable semester-long experience.    Students may also spend a semester abroad at one of NYU's many other study abroad sites .    Student Activities    From your first year, your involvement in departmental activities will round out your learning. You may join the Special Education Club, which is a chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children. You may also take advantage of various departmental seminars and social activities concerned with the education of children. Students are also encouraged to join Steinhardt's Undergraduate Student Government.    Education in Comparative Perspectives    You are strongly encouraged to spend a semester abroad in one of NYU's many study abroad sites in Paris, Madrid, Florence, Berlin, London, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Prague, or Ghana. NYU in London offers a special course for teacher education students that takes them to British schools and classrooms for observation and firsthand learning.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.        Senior Honors    Qualified seniors who wish to pursue a guided research in an area of educational   inquiry may participate in a special yearlong seminar called Honors Research   in Teaching and Learning. Working with the faculty instructor, students are   guided through the process of selecting a topic of inquiry, developing research   questions, choosing and implementing appropriate methodologies, building   outlines, developing bibliographies and writing literature reviews, and preparing   drafts. The seminar meets regularly during the first semester as students   develop their questions and projects. During the second semester, each student   works independently on a project under the direction of his or her own faculty   supervisor, with whom the student holds regular meetings. Students meet periodically   with their seminar classmates to share their research and findings as they   refine and complete their final projects.

Apply NOW Online GRADUATE      asd nest support project at NYU Steinhardt          M.A. Program in Early Childhood Education, Birth-Grade 2     The Early Childhood Education Program reflects three central themes:       Creating quality care for all children through the development of strong relationships with families and their communities    Developing teaching practice as reflective practitioners and teacher researchers    A commitment to social justice for young children and their families           Core Values    Programs in early childhood and childhood education prepare teachers and other professionals to work with children from birth through later childhood. Graduate preservice programs lead to the Master of Arts degree and fulfill academic requirements for initial, professional, or permanent teacher certification in New York State, depending on the student&rsquo;s background.    Students in the Early Childhood and Childhood Education Programs are not a homogeneous group. They vary widely in age and background. Many were liberal arts or business majors as undergraduates. Some are making a career change. All have chosen teaching because they are interested in children and are seeking a career that is personally rewarding.    The program helps prospective teachers develop as decision makers and reflective practitioners who are committed to work in urban schools and to using the city as a core resource for their learning. Prospective teachers are immersed in thoughtful discussions and interactions around the critical educational issues of our times, especially issues of developmental, linguistic, cultural, and racial diversity and educational equity. Each course in the program is tied to either fieldwork or student teaching, generating rich and authentic reflections upon theory and practice.    The program:       Involves deep study of how children learn at different developmental stages and in different contexts, as well as strategies for supporting the learning    Fosters an understanding of the relationships between and among schools, families, and community-based organizations as they interact to impact student learning    Develops both content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge with an understanding that both are needed at high levels by teachers    Supports the growth of teachers as social advocates for educational equity in a pluralistic culture       Quality Care for All Children    Our foremost concern is creating quality care and education for all children. The belief in social justice is inherent in the multiple strands of our graduate early childhood teacher certification program at New York University. Children are at the center of our curriculum and study. We see children as competent persons actively engaged in meaning making in the multiple contexts in which they find themselves. We recognize the singular importance of parents and families in nurturing young children and the need of educators to develop reciprocal relationships with each family. The family&rsquo;s rich knowledge of their children should help inform care giving and educational practices, and our advocacy efforts should take that knowledge into consideration.    The programs:       Involve deep study of how children develop in multiple context and offer recursive teaching experiences in a variety of settings    Provide a strong principle-based set of practices regarding learning environments and educational experiences    Support children and adults in learning to accept and respect each other&rsquo;s differences    Foster a critical view of people&rsquo;s histories    Consider the needs, lifestyles, languages, and cultural patterns of the communities we serve    Show respect for and encourage equal status for all people    Encourage taking immediate action to interrupt our own and other&rsquo;s discriminatory behavior    Advocate institutional changes that value early childhood education as a vital part of a child&rsquo;s educational experiences       Our view is that the central component of teachers&rsquo; development as teacher/researchers is continual reflection on their own and others&rsquo; educational practices.

To meet this challenge, we have created two dual certification programs that are at the cutting edge of the profession:       Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education (Grades 1-6)    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education (Birth-Grade 2)       This design recognizes that whether our graduates choose to work in general education settings, special education settings, or inclusive settings, they need to share a set of common understandings. Thus, our students acquire a firm knowledge base in human development and variability in development. They acquire knowledge and skills for providing enriching, child-centered educational environments and learn how to adapt those environments to meet the needs of the diverse students in their classes.    Graduates from these dual certification programs share visions for their students. They acquire the collaborative skills to realize those visions with teachers, parents, and other education and health professionals. In short, NYU's integrated, dual certification programs model the process its graduates will use throughout their careers.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.

Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professionals, as well as professionals from related disciplines to provide learning opportunities for children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of settings.    Focusing on How Children Learn and Develop    Our Teacher Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education within the Department of Teaching and Learning is an urban-centered and field-based program that gives a thorough command of an integrated curriculum grounded in a deep understanding of children's growth and development, with an emphasis on human variability. You will have practical experience in the field, and you will gain mastery of the various content areas of the elementary curriculum (mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts), as well as learn to create and adapt learning environments that allow all children to grow to their maximum potential.    Strong Emphasis on the Liberal Arts    A solid foundation in a wide range of liberal arts subjects and expertise in one area of the liberal arts are critical to your development as a first-rate teacher. With our liberal arts core and the 30-point liberal arts concentration required by New York State for teacher certification, our baccalaureate program ensures that you will receive the best possible preparation to be a teacher. For your liberal arts concentration, choose from such areas as history, literature, science, mathematics, and from many other offerings in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the College of Arts and Science. Your knowledge of teaching children will be supported by courses in human development, educational foundations, and inquiry-based education.    Study Abroad    We strongly encourage study abroad for all students. London, UK and Accra, Ghana are our academic partner sites. We offer the required course Human Development through NYU in London and NYU-Accra for teacher education students. The course includes weekly observations in British or Ghanaian schools and classrooms for first-hand learning in the local context. Students typically combine this course with three liberal-arts electives for an unforgettable semester-long experience.    Students may also spend a semester abroad at one of NYU's many other study abroad sites .    Student Activities    From your first year, your involvement in departmental activities will round out your learning. You may join the Special Education Club, which is a chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children. You may also take advantage of various departmental seminars and social activities concerned with the education of children. Students are also encouraged to join Steinhardt's Undergraduate Student Government.    Education in Comparative Perspectives    You are strongly encouraged to spend a semester abroad in one of NYU's many study abroad sites in Paris, Madrid, Florence, Berlin, London, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Prague, or Ghana. NYU in London offers a special course for teacher education students that takes them to British schools and classrooms for observation and firsthand learning.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.        Senior Honors    Qualified seniors who wish to pursue a guided research in an area of educational   inquiry may participate in a special yearlong seminar called Honors Research   in Teaching and Learning. Working with the faculty instructor, students are   guided through the process of selecting a topic of inquiry, developing research   questions, choosing and implementing appropriate methodologies, building   outlines, developing bibliographies and writing literature reviews, and preparing   drafts. The seminar meets regularly during the first semester as students   develop their questions and projects. During the second semester, each student   works independently on a project under the direction of his or her own faculty   supervisor, with whom the student holds regular meetings. Students meet periodically   with their seminar classmates to share their research and findings as they   refine and complete their final projects.

To meet this challenge, we have created two dual certification programs that are at the cutting edge of the profession:       Childhood Education and Childhood Special Education (Grades 1-6)    Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education (Birth-Grade 2)       This design recognizes that whether our graduates choose to work in general education settings, special education settings, or inclusive settings, they need to share a set of common understandings. Thus, our students acquire a firm knowledge base in human development and variability in development. They acquire knowledge and skills for providing enriching, child-centered educational environments and learn how to adapt those environments to meet the needs of the diverse students in their classes.    Graduates from these dual certification programs share visions for their students. They acquire the collaborative skills to realize those visions with teachers, parents, and other education and health professionals. In short, NYU's integrated, dual certification programs model the process its graduates will use throughout their careers.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.     NYU Steinhardt Graduates in Education Ranked among the Highest Paid by USA Today      How to Apply      asd nest support project at NYU Steinhardt          BS Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education     Opening Doors and Supporting the Diverse Needs of Learners    The Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education is designed to prepare teachers for infant-toddler, pre-K, or grade K-2 general education or special education programs. Program graduates will be prepared to work in collaboration with families and other education professionals, as well as professionals from related disciplines to provide learning opportunities for children with varying capacities and needs in a variety of settings.    Focusing on How Children Learn and Develop    Our Teacher Certification Program in Early Childhood Education and Early Childhood Special Education within the Department of Teaching and Learning is an urban-centered and field-based program that gives a thorough command of an integrated curriculum grounded in a deep understanding of children's growth and development, with an emphasis on human variability. You will have practical experience in the field, and you will gain mastery of the various content areas of the elementary curriculum (mathematics, science, social studies, and language arts), as well as learn to create and adapt learning environments that allow all children to grow to their maximum potential.    Strong Emphasis on the Liberal Arts    A solid foundation in a wide range of liberal arts subjects and expertise in one area of the liberal arts are critical to your development as a first-rate teacher. With our liberal arts core and the 30-point liberal arts concentration required by New York State for teacher certification, our baccalaureate program ensures that you will receive the best possible preparation to be a teacher. For your liberal arts concentration, choose from such areas as history, literature, science, mathematics, and from many other offerings in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the College of Arts and Science. Your knowledge of teaching children will be supported by courses in human development, educational foundations, and inquiry-based education.    Study Abroad    We strongly encourage study abroad for all students. London, UK and Accra, Ghana are our academic partner sites. We offer the required course Human Development through NYU in London and NYU-Accra for teacher education students. The course includes weekly observations in British or Ghanaian schools and classrooms for first-hand learning in the local context. Students typically combine this course with three liberal-arts electives for an unforgettable semester-long experience.    Students may also spend a semester abroad at one of NYU's many other study abroad sites .    Student Activities    From your first year, your involvement in departmental activities will round out your learning. You may join the Special Education Club, which is a chapter of the Council for Exceptional Children. You may also take advantage of various departmental seminars and social activities concerned with the education of children. Students are also encouraged to join Steinhardt's Undergraduate Student Government.    Education in Comparative Perspectives    You are strongly encouraged to spend a semester abroad in one of NYU's many study abroad sites in Paris, Madrid, Florence, Berlin, London, Buenos Aires, Shanghai, Prague, or Ghana. NYU in London offers a special course for teacher education students that takes them to British schools and classrooms for observation and firsthand learning.    Financial Support for Master's Study    NYU Steinhardt offers generous Scholarships for Advanced Study to graduating seniors in Teaching and Learning who want to continue on for their master's degree in early childhood or childhood education, secondary education, literacy education, special education, or environmental conservation education at NYU Steinhardt.        Senior Honors    Qualified seniors who wish to pursue a guided research in an area of educational   inquiry may participate in a special yearlong seminar called Honors Research   in Teaching and Learning. Working with the faculty instructor, students are   guided through the process of selecting a topic of inquiry, developing research   questions, choosing and implementing appropriate methodologies, building   outlines, developing bibliographies and writing literature reviews, and preparing   drafts. The seminar meets regularly during the first semester as students   develop their questions and projects. During the second semester, each student   works independently on a project under the direction of his or her own faculty   supervisor, with whom the student holds regular meetings. Students meet periodically   with their seminar classmates to share their research and findings as they   refine and complete their final projects.

Apply NOW Online GRADUATE      asd nest support project at NYU Steinhardt          M.A. Program in Early Childhood Education, Birth-Grade 2     The Early Childhood Education Program reflects three central themes:       Creating quality care for all children through the development of strong relationships with families and their communities    Developing teaching practice as reflective practitioners and teacher researchers    A commitment to social justice for young children and their families           Core Values    Programs in early childhood and childhood education prepare teachers and other professionals to work with children from birth through later childhood. Graduate preservice programs lead to the Master of Arts degree and fulfill academic requirements for initial, professional, or permanent teacher certification in New York State, depending on the student&rsquo;s background.    Students in the Early Childhood and Childhood Education Programs are not a homogeneous group. They vary widely in age and background. Many were liberal arts or business majors as undergraduates. Some are making a career change. All have chosen teaching because they are interested in children and are seeking a career that is personally rewarding.    The program helps prospective teachers develop as decision makers and reflective practitioners who are committed to work in urban schools and to using the city as a core resource for their learning. Prospective teachers are immersed in thoughtful discussions and interactions around the critical educational issues of our times, especially issues of developmental, linguistic, cultural, and racial diversity and educational equity. Each course in the program is tied to either fieldwork or student teaching, generating rich and authentic reflections upon theory and practice.    The program:       Involves deep study of how children learn at different developmental stages and in different contexts, as well as strategies for supporting the learning    Fosters an understanding of the relationships between and among schools, families, and community-based organizations as they interact to impact student learning    Develops both content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge with an understanding that both are needed at high levels by teachers    Supports the growth of teachers as social advocates for educational equity in a pluralistic culture       Quality Care for All Children    Our foremost concern is creating quality care and education for all children. The belief in social justice is inherent in the multiple strands of our graduate early childhood teacher certification program at New York University. Children are at the center of our curriculum and study. We see children as competent persons actively engaged in meaning making in the multiple contexts in which they find themselves. We recognize the singular importance of parents and families in nurturing young children and the need of educators to develop reciprocal relationships with each family. The family&rsquo;s rich knowledge of their children should help inform care giving and educational practices, and our advocacy efforts should take that knowledge into consideration.    The programs:       Involve deep study of how children develop in multiple context and offer recursive teaching experiences in a variety of settings    Provide a strong principle-based set of practices regarding learning environments and educational experiences    Support children and adults in learning to accept and respect each other&rsquo;s differences    Foster a critical view of people&rsquo;s histories    Consider the needs, lifestyles, languages, and cultural patterns of the communities we serve    Show respect for and encourage equal status for all people    Encourage taking immediate action to interrupt our own and other&rsquo;s discriminatory behavior    Advocate institutional changes that value early childhood education as a vital part of a child&rsquo;s educational experiences       Our view is that the central component of teachers&rsquo; development as teacher/researchers is continual reflection on their own and others&rsquo; educational practices. We believe that careful reflection and examination will help preservice teachers to develop powerful tools as caring, talented, and committed professionals who will be equipped to address our stated program strands.
