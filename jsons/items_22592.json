NYU School of Law\u2019s Jacobson Leadership Program in Law and Business places students showing exceptional promise at the forefront of this convergence. The program capitalizes on the strengths of New York University\u2019s dynamic Law and Business schools and their location in the financial center of the world.   The program is addressed to those students who aspire to a non-traditional career path that requires intensive training grounded in legal and business curricula. Graduates of the program will be equipped with the professional training that will enable them to take on leadership roles here and around the world.      The Jacobson Leadership Program provides scholarships in amounts up to full tuition to scholars who aspire to a non-traditional career path that requires intensive training grounded in legal and business curricula. Graduates of the program will be equipped with the professional training that will enable them to take on leadership roles at home and around the world. The Jacobson Leadership Program simultaneously seeks to instill the highest ethical standards, and provides the skills for leaders to build bridges across boundaries of jurisdiction, sector, and culture.   Unique features include a Law and Business Mentor network, designed to connect business-minded students with mentors in the corporate world and a senior project where students work independently or collaboratively in small teams and present their projects to a panel of faculty and alumni. Students have the opportunity to construct an academic program, with the guidance of the faculty co-directors, which is tailored to their interests and draws on the curricula of both the School of Law and the Stern School of Business. The Office of Career Services hosts recruiting and educational career panels and programs, and arranges mentorship conversations with business leaders. The Amy and Brian Schorr Family Luncheon Speaker Series features business leaders sponsored by both the Stern School of Business and the School of Law. The Jacobson Leadership Program also benefits greatly from NYU School of Law's expanding global presence, and international opportunities offer students chances to examine the interplay between law, business and public policy in other countries and regions of the globe.   The Law and Business Niche   Today, as Asia explodes with economic growth, the welfare of our nation depends more than ever on our capacity to produce products and services that deliver value to a competitive global marketplace. To do this successfully requires more than diligence and dedication. It requires a capacity for imaginative thinking when faced with novel circumstances that we believe law school education is exceptionally good at providing.   It is therefore important to provide business-oriented students with the flexibility to move beyond the boundaries of traditional legal training. New York University has recognized this for years, offering a four-year JD/MBA degree since 1992. The law and business focus at the Law School allows students to avail themselves of the benefits of a cutting-edge law and business education by pursuing either of two tracks: the intensive four-year Jacobson JD/MBA dual degree, or the streamlined three-year JD with a concentration in law and business.   The full cohort of the Jacobson Leadership Program includes Jacobson JD Scholars, Jacobson JD/MBA Students and Scholars, Nordlicht Family Scholars, and the Reynolds Fellows.   NYU\u2019s Jacobson Leadership Program in Law and Business is designed to educate the next generation of business law entrepreneurs seeking a legal education as a background for leadership positions in business. Students joining the program are provided with a curriculum focused on law and business under the supervision of Jacobson Leadership Program Faculty Co-Directors Professor Gerald Rosenfeld and Professor Helen Scott.
