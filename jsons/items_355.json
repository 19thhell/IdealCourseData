The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.

Information on all children is recorded by the National Data Evaluation Center, in Columbus, Ohio, and is analyzed and reported by the Reading Recovery Project. In addition to providing the districts with the standardized evaluation results and other data related to program implementation, the Reading Recovery Project at New York University publishes the research findings, geared toward the general educational community. The most recent reports available from NYU's Reading Recovery Project's (or online in PDF format), summarize results for Reading Recovery students in New York City and New Jersey for the school year 2007-2008. The reported results demonstrate that:       1. NYU-affiliated districts provide quality instruction and efficient implementation of Reading Recovery, as evidenced by a high proportion of at-risk students who successfully complete the program. 2. Reading Recovery children catch up with their peers scoring within the classroom average on various literacy measures, and being able to read texts of appropriate level of difficulty (using an Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement, Clay (2002).          3. Reading Recovery is cost effective, as it reduces rates of retention, or referral and placement to special education for Reading Recovery children, when compared to other at-risk students.    4. Reading Recovery children maintain their literacy gains beyond the first grade, and achieve similar results on standardized tests as their classroom peers.       The New York City and New Jersey reports corroborate earlier research which demonstrates that Reading Recovery has a substantial positive impact on children's literacy development. Reviews of Reading Recovery research by Pinnell (1995) and by Askew et al. (1998) provide excellent sources for research findings on various aspects of the program such as teaching and learning, teacher development, program implementation, as well as comprehensive evidence on program success and cost-effectiveness, culled from the extensive body of state-wide and international research spanning the last three decades.    Researchers with the Reading Recovery Project have also explored some important aspects of program implementation. Ashdown and Simic (1998) reported on the link between daily delivery of Reading Recovery lessons and success in reading, emphasizing the intensive nature of Reading Recovery instruction as a key to accelerated learning. Ashdown and Simic (1999) have also reported data from a large sample of students in the metropolitan area, which suggest that Reading Recovery also provides an appropriate solution to reading problems for students whose native language is not English. Currently in preparation are studies focusing on cost-effectiveness, and on factors influencing program effectiveness in diverse settings. Both draw data from the implementation of Reading Recovery at NYU-affiliated school districts.       Research Bibliography       Ashdown, J.E. and Simic, O. (1998, April).
