Once an FMLN radio announcer, he broke ranks when he became disillusioned with their ideology. Guadalupe lost her parents, husband, and a son in the war. With seven children left to raise on her own, she nonetheless supports the actions of the FMLN, and believes in the cause which took the lives of so many of her loved ones. Angel, formerly an FMLN guerrilla, was a mortal enemy of Nicolas, who was a policeman during the conflict. Now they are both members of the National Civil Police - and friends. Miguel and Vitelio are war orphans, trying to reconstruct a semblance of family life. And Francisco is a happy to lucky bus ticket collector whose primary interests are women and Hollywood. As the film presents the lives of Salvadorans today, it also questions the stability of the calm and asks whether the foundations of the peace accord - controlling delinquency, meting justice, redistributing land, and fighting poverty - will ever be realized. Seven Dreams of Peace is a hopeful and troubling look at the legacy of the war in El Salvador.

PHYSICAL FEATURES: 1 videocassette (53 min.) : sd., b&amp;w ; 1/2 in.  Call Number: VCA 1440  Summary: This &quot;film editorial&quot; reviews U.S. relations with Latin America in general and with Cuba and Venezuela in particular in the early 1960&#39;s. At a meeting of the Organization of American States (OAS) in San Jose, Costa Rica, the U.S. uses its influence to expel Cuba from the meeting and sponsors the Declaration of San Jose, condemning Sino-Soviet intervention in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere and the shipment of Soviet missiles to Cuba. Venezuelan foreign minister Arcaya sides with Cuba at the meeting and is subsequently removed from office by Venezuelan president Betancourt. This action spurs big anti-American protests in Caracas. The film then looks at the general dire poverty that prevails throughout Latin American and suggests that such poverty helps foster anti-American feeling in the region. Finally the film turns to Cuba, where we see people whose lives are being changed by Castro&#39;s regime, and also Castro addressing a protest rally of over one million people. The Declaration of Havana was made at this meeting, denouncing the Declaration of San Jose.
