This page contains links to almost everything you ever wanted to know about the data that is available on my site (and more). I have broken the page down into five constituent parts to make it more naviagable.     About Data : I lay out the history/philosophy of my datasets, the timing of the data, the sources I use and some caveats/rules for data usage.   Data Breakdown : I explain how I break the data down by variable , by industry , by region , by time and by company .   Current Data : This is where the data resides, broken down into corporate finance, valuation and portfolio management sections.   Archived Data : If you need the data from prior years, you will find it here, broken down into corporate finance, valuation and portfolio management sections.   Webcasts/Tools : These are webcasts , tools (spreadsheets) , blog posts and writings about data analysis.     The data is updated in the first two weeks of every year and the most recent update was on January 5, 2015. The next major update will be in mid-January 2016, though a few of the data sets will get updated more frequently."}]},

This page contains links to almost everything you ever wanted to know about the data that is available on my site (and more). I have broken the page down into five constituent parts to make it more naviagable.     About Data : I lay out the history/philosophy of my datasets, the timing of the data, the sources I use and some caveats/rules for data usage.   Data Breakdown : I explain how I break the data down by variable , by industry , by region , by time and by company .   Current Data : This is where the data resides, broken down into corporate finance, valuation and portfolio management sections.   Archived Data : If you need the data from prior years, you will find it here, broken down into corporate finance, valuation and portfolio management sections.   Webcasts/Tools : These are webcasts , tools (spreadsheets) , blog posts and writings about data analysis.     The data is updated in the first two weeks of every year and the most recent update was on January 5, 2015. The next major update will be in mid-January 2016, though a few of the data sets will get updated more frequently."}, {"content": "Return on Equity                                                                              Return    on Equity by Sector (US)    Data Used : Multiple data services    Date of Analysis : Data used is as of January 2015    Download as an excel file instead : http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pc/datasets/roe.xls    For global datasets: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/data.html          can be obtained by clicking here    on   which companies are included in each industry                                           Industry      Number of firms      ROE     (unadjusted)      ROE (adjusted     for R&amp;D)              Advertising      52      17.92%      17.79%              Aerospace/Defense      93      24.54%      17.80%              Air Transport      22      2.84%      2.84%              Apparel      64      18.48%      18.05%              Auto &amp;     Truck      22      18.61%      10.89%              Auto Parts      75      15.84%      11.40%              Bank (Money     Center)      13      8.21%      8.21%              Banks     (Regional)      676      8.87%      8.87%              Beverage     (Alcoholic)      22      13.66%      13.65%              Beverage     (Soft)      46      27.88%      27.04%              Broadcasting      28      18.80%      18.80%              Brokerage     &amp; Investment Banking      46      10.38%      10.37%              Building     Materials      39      14.81%      13.79%              Business &amp;     Consumer Services      177      12.43%      12.23%              Cable TV      18      31.43%      31.27%              Chemical     (Basic)      46      14.72%      14.07%              Chemical     (Diversified)      10      21.60%      16.42%              Chemical     (Specialty)      103      19.22%      16.70%              Coal &amp;     Related Energy      42      -6.41%      -8.65%              Computer     Services      119      32.01%      23.33%              Computers/Peripherals      64      25.04%      20.69%              Construction     Supplies      55      19.50%      15.51%              Diversified      23      11.00%      10.35%              Drugs     (Biotechnology)      400      11.94%      8.43%              Drugs     (Pharmaceutical)      151      17.06%      11.81%              Education      42      3.76%      3.80%              Electrical     Equipment      126      12.61%      11.62%              Electronics     (Consumer &amp; Office)      28      12.81%      10.77%              Electronics     (General)      189      8.67%      7.40%              Engineering/Construction      56      5.27%      5.24%              Entertainment      84      17.84%      17.83%              Environmental     &amp; Waste Services      103      5.68%      5.66%              Farming/Agriculture      37      13.54%      12.15%              Financial     Svcs.
