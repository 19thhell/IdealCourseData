Guided Research and MA Thesis Form             Engl.GA.1083 x-listed with Irish Studies   Literature of Modern Ireland    John Waters   Monday 3:30-6:00pm \u2013Ireland House, Room 101     This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.           Engl.GA.1957.001   Textuality    Perry Meisel   Monday 6:20-8:20pm\u201419 UP, Room 222     An introduction to literary theory from structuralism, deconstruction, and psychoanalysis to New Historicism and post-colonialism. Readings will include basic texts by Saussure, Barthes, Bakhtin, Derrida, Althusser, Lacan, Foucault, and Fanon. Philosophical tradition from Hegel to Freud will contextualize what is a single movement of thought defined by continuity rather than by ruptures. The course will begin and endwith literary texts, including Shakespeare, to measure what the theoretical tradition brings to both practical criticism and literary and cultural history. Open to both graduate students and advanced undergraduates.           Engl.GA.2075.001 MA Thesis Writing Colloquium Maureen N. McLane Wednesday, 5-7pm An intense yet convivial biweekly seminar for MA students to support them as they pursue research and write their MA Theses. This seminar will feature short writing assignments and deadlines all geared to the completion of the thesis; peer review of drafts; research/library excursions; some brief yet methodologically stimulating readings--from, e.g., Moretti, Bakhtin, inter alia. Students' projects will affect, and be reflected in, the course syllabus. The main project of this seminar is to create an intellectual, sociable community for MA students as they pursue their writing and research. Meeting (on average) every other week, Wed. 5-7 pm, Rm 805, 244 Greene St. First meeting September 3, 2014.           MEDI-GA-2100.002   Old English    Michael Matto Monday 6:20-8:20pm     This course is designed for students who are interested in the language, literature, and culture of England up to the Norman Conquest of 1066. It will provide solid practice in the language and close reading of texts, both canonical and not-quite-canonical, while introducing students to cultural and historical backgrounds, representative secondary material, and the reception of the Middle Ages in the modern era.     Students should contact MARC Administrator Crystal Parsons for registration access.           Engl.GA.2521.001   Cultural Institutions in Restoration England    Bill Blake   Thursday 6:20-8:20pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     This course will look at British literature of the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries alongside a range of new cultural agendas\u2014from the banding together of a small group of libertine radicals to the formation of an evangelical culture of moral reform; from the invention of \u201chigh\u201d culture to the rise of literary professionalism, even as the arts themselves were changing under the impetus of democratization and liberal values. With a special focus on drama and theatre, primary texts will include plays and critical writings by John Milton, William Davenant, Margaret Cavendish, John Dryden, William Wycherley, Aphra Behn, Thomas Otway, William Congreve, Susanna Centlivre, Joseph Addison, and John Dennis. Our supplemental reading will build on various theoretical formulations\u2014systems theory, discourse analysis, cultural sociology, the history of concepts\u2014to explore how new institutions, new policies, new cultural producers, and new audiences transformed both the forms and practices of public art during this period.           Engl.GA.2661.001 Victorian Studies: The Victorian Nervous/System    Jeff Spear   Thursday 4:00-6:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     This seminar will explore three overlapping areas of both social and personal anxiety in the Victorian period: class, gender and the permeability of the body and body politic as expressed in, for example, Dracula and Conan Doyle\u2019s The Sign of the Four. We will begin with theory: Taussig on the Nervous/System, Benjamin \u201cOn History,\u201d and Mitchell on \u201cEkphrasis and Other.\u201d The course readings will include work by Carlyle (Past and Present), Carroll, Gaskell North and South)Dickens (Oliver) Ruskin, Collins (No Name),Tennyson, (Maud) D.G. Rossetti, G. Eliot (Mill on the Floss) \u201cGeorge Egerton\u201cand the New Woman. The last week will be devoted to visual and popular culture. Each week will have some contextual critical or historical reading.     The main course requirements are contributions to the weekly discussion board, an oral presentation with bibliography on the reading for one week and a term paper on the model of a journal article. Students who are not planning to apply to a PhD program in English can propose an alternative term project equivalent to the scholarly article project.           Engl.GA.2838.001   The Slave\u2019s Story    Elizabeth McHenry   Thursday 10:00-12:00pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     \u201cAmerica has the mournful honor of adding a new department to the literature of civilization,\u2014the autobiographies of escaped slaves,\u201d wrote Ephraim Peabody in his 1849 essay, \u201cNarratives of Fugitive Slaves.\u201d \u201cWe know not where one who wishes to write a modern Odyssey could find a better subject than in the adventures of a fugitive slave.\u201d This course will examine these adventures\u2014slave narratives\u2014from their emergence in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century, to their modern counterparts, the contemporary narratives of slavery that echo and are influenced by the genre, as well as the vibrant imaginings of fugitive narratives in contemporary art and film. By looking at the slave\u2019s story as it has been written into the American literary landscape in both the 19th and 20th centuries, we will explore the premise that underlies Peabody\u2019s 1849 statement: how or in what ways does the deployment of slavery as a literary subject make art \u201cmodern\u201d? Our work will revolve in part around examining the tensions that developed in the 19th century for slave narrators between communicating the material conditions of slavery and the dynamics of systems of slavery as they related to the making and unmaking of American citizens, and participating in evolving debates about the scope\u2014social, political, aesthetic\u2014of literary arts. In the second part of the semester we will contrast the tropes and modes of 19th century slave narratives with re-visions of slavery in 20th century texts, to see how, for instance, rebellions and resistance are re-imagined in retrospect and how the forms and meanings of freedom differ from 19th century slave narratives. Student should expect to read or reread several of the most critically acclaimed slave narratives; but a primary interest will be to examine narratives that have received less critical attention, with an eye toward identifying the literary and historical contexts of slave narratives, the complex conditions of their authorship and publication, and their key generic and aesthetic features. How can these lesser-known texts to help us to deconstruct what we think we know about the slave narrative? As twenty-first century scholars of American and African American literature, revisiting the slave narrative will provide a way to question the assessments of twentieth century critics of this genre, including the very fundamental question of whether slave narratives can be conceived of as a coherent literary genre at all.           Engl.GA.2841.001   American Fiction to 1900-1945    Jo Hendin   Thursday 3:30-5:30pm--244 Greene Street, Room 105     American fiction in this period embodies the variety and anxiety of an era of rapid change. How writers and critics attempted to define and respond to the idea of the \u201cnew\u201d or the \u201ctransformed\u201d illuminates specific works of literary art and the cultural contexts in which they were created. In literary practice and critical discourse, passages from realism to naturalism to modernism, and the reinvention of forms in an era of variety and synthesis, help shape the imagination of domestic and political reality. Through readings in fiction and selected critical essays, this course explores an aesthetic of change forged by working artists and analyzed by critics. The course is intended as a survey of forms and practices with an emphasis on modernism and contemporary, eclectic style.           Engl.GA.2900.001 x-listed with Comp Lit   Reading the Global South: Uneven Development, Critical Geography, and Anti-Imperial Thinking    Ana Dopico   Tuesday 1:00-3:00pm\u201419UP, Room 229     This course seeks to create a comparative ground for cultural politics typically separated by language, imperial histories, and neo-colonial maps. It takes up the cultural, political, historical and theoretical consequences of uneven development as an enduring truth of the global order. It engages the politics and economies of imperialism and the history and theory of anti-imperialism. We will consider the idea of the Global South as a topography of uneven development and uneven temporalities, where notions of modernity and periphery are affirmed and contested and where the names and practices of resistance, rebellion, and critique continue to engage not only metropolitan centers but the force of the state. The course looks beyond \u201carea studies\u201d definitions and seeks a materialist and critical geography, turning toward a hemispheric Southern critique that challenged empire, globalization, democratization, neoliberalism and permanent warfare long before the current political moment. We will trace the political and critical genealogies, the disciplinary canonizations, and the popular life of an indispensable contestatory archive\u2014an archive whose long history helps to contextualize and demystify the geopolitics of the present, as well as the politics of the academy. The course is in part designed to offer comparatists and students from varied fields an engagement with texts whose messy political engagements and materialist foundations have lately been rather marginalized by a reaffirmation of theoretical universals.      We will consider how old ideological mappings like third world, underdevelopment, revolution and old imperial and cold wars continue to haunt new articulations of triumphalist or cataclysmic futures and geopolitical destinies. The course traces themes and variations of a global anti-imperialism, its constituencies, and its critical strategies; it stresses how these contestatory narratives have irrevocably altered the cultural politics and cultural markets of international metropoli and international policy. It seeks also to distinguish \u201csouthern\u201d contexts for struggles around feminism, race and labor, and to follow the trajectory of these struggles into a theoretical \u201cmainstream\u201d. Readings establish connections between nationalist struggles, critiques of hegemony, and resistant narratives, looking back over almost a century of foundational texts from Luxemburg to Gramsci, to Mari\u00e1tegui, to Fanon and Memmi and connecting them to the work of writers as varied as Said, Chatterjee, Garc\u00eda Canclini, Pratt, Spivak, Jameson and Appadurai. The course will proceed thematically as a wide survey of history, criticism, and theory but always considering forms of cultural production that often precede and exceed theorization.           Engl.GA.2902.001   Writing Africa    Lucy Graham   Tuesdays 3:30-5:30pm--244 Greene Street, Room 105              This course focuses on a selection of texts about Africa, from the mid twentieth century until the present day. Beginning with African liberation theory, we shall read some of the writings of Leopold Senghor, Frantz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko. The second part of the course will move on to discuss classic or canonical African novels, such as Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart (1958) and Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s A Grain of Wheat (1967). In the third section we shall discuss contemporary theorizing of the African postcolony by writers such as Achille Mbembe, and postcolonial metafiction such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa\u2019s The Book of Chameleons (2004) and Phaswane Mpe\u2019s Welcome to our Hillbrow (2001). In the final weeks of the course we shall discuss films about Africa, including: The Battle of Algiers (1966), directed by Gillo Pontecorvo and based on the writings of Fanon; Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s Hyenas (2004), a bitingly satirical allegory of the effects of the IMF and World Bank in Africa, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s Moolaad\u00e9 (2004); as well as the South African film Hijack Stories (2000), co-written by Oliver Schmitz and Lesego Rampolokeng.           Engl.GA.2957.001   Queer Affect Theory    Jonathan Flatley   Tuesday, 12:00-2:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306      This seminar will examine the relationship between queer theory and the \u201caffective turn\u201d in the humanities and social sciences. The intersection between these two vital areas of scholarly inquiry is perhaps marked most clearly by Eve Sedgwick\u2019s turn toward affect, represented by her essay on shame and queer performativity in Henry James (in the first issue of GLQ, 1993), her co-editing (with Adam Frank) of the work of Silvan Tomkins (Shame and Its Sisters, 1995) and her subsequent work on Melanie Klein, the depressive position, and reparative reading. But understandings of feeling had already been important in some of the writing from which queer theory emerged: Audre Lorde on anger and the erotic in Sister Outsider; Michel Foucault\u2019s critique of the repressive hypothesis and his emphasis on bodies, pleasures and friendship; and writing by Douglas Crimp, Leo Bersani and others on sex, mourning and militancy in relation to AIDS and ACT-UP. After reading these foundational works, we will consider to what extent and with what implications queerness has subsequently been understood as a particular kind or mode of feeling. For instance, in asking whether some experience of melancholia or depression is central to queerness we will read works by Freud, Melanie Klein, Butler, Sedgwick, Crimp, Ann Cvetkovich, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, and Heather Love. In considering optimism, collectivity, happiness, activism, love, the death drive, utopia, shame and stigma we will also read work by Theresa de Lauretis, Gloria Anzaldua, Sara Ahmed, Lauren Berlant, Lee Edelman, Mel Chen, Deborah Gould, Sianne Ngai, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Luc Nancy, and Paolo Virno. Although we will focus mainly on critical and theoretical works, we will also decide together on a range of aesthetic objects to anchor our discussion through the semester.           Engl.GA.2971.001   Practicum in Digital Humanities: Mapping Archives: Cultural Geographies of New York City    Tom Augst   Tuesday 6:20-8:20pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     Drawing on materials at NYU Libraries, this course introduces students to concepts, methods, and tools for spatial analysis of the archival record. Exploring digital tools, resources, and research practices for mapping and visualization, the course will focus on interpreting and representing diverse forms of evidence: textual and nontextual, scribal and printed, qualitative and quantitative, institutional and personal. Applying critical and theoretical perspectives, students will participate in a lab component for the course, designed to build competencies in the use of computational methods for understanding and manipulating data in the humanities. Although course exercises and discussions will focus on modeling a collaborative research platform related to New York City, students will have opportunities to develop research goals related to individual areas and periods of scholarly interest.             Engl.GA.2980.001   MA Pro-Seminar    Juliet Fleming   Wednesday 11:00-1:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     Criticism Practical and Impractical     Practical criticism is a method of close reading designed to enhance our responsiveness to what we read. It develops a knowledge of literary forms, and provides technical language for describing the ways in which writers achieve their effects. As prescribed by I. A. Richards in the 1920s it treats literature as something separate from social and economic spheres and from the personal concerns of its author: had you taken an exam prepared by the followers of Richards at Cambridge you would have been required to produce a close analysis of, organised response to, and finally judgement of three pieces of literary writing that were unnamed and undated. Part of the work of this seminar will be to prepare you for (a modified version of) that exam -- and, beyond that, for a career founded upon your skills of close reading and your ability to recognise the presence and consequences of literary forms, metres, punctuation, rhyme schemes, diction, syntax and layout. In every meeting we will practice reading, talking and writing about literary forms. The other part of our work will be to familiarise ourselves with a different type of close-reading, one that is famously not a method, and that eschews the pleasures of judgment. Deconstruction is the unsatisfactory name for what is, above all, a heightened commitment to reading -- one that refuses the limits of any criticism that would be practical but that nevertheless offers a profound education in thinking about literary texts. Throughout the semester we will use Derrida's writing to lighten, baffle, enrich and deflect our own developing attempts at literary analysis and judgment.           Engl.GA.2980.002   MA Pro-Seminar    Maureen McLane   Wednesday 4:00-6:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306      What is Literature? Why study \u201cit\u201d? How study \u201cit\u201d? Does \u201cliterature\u201d exist? How has it been, how is it now, and how might it yet be studied, imagined, engaged, and/or critiqued? And how might advanced literary study be inflected by other advanced studies\u2014of, for example, media history and ecology, book history, historiography, the human sciences (linguistics, psychoanalysis, anthropology)? This course offers a series of intense experimental gambits: with assigned readings in a variety of methodological and theoretical keys, from a range of historical periods, we will begin to consider where literary study has been, where it is, and where it might be going. We will engage the pleasure of the text and the rigor of the text and may confront as well the displeasure of the text: our task will be to register each of these possibilities.           Engl.GA.3323.001   Topics in Renaissance Lit: Milton    John Guillory   Monday 1:00-3:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     In this seminar we will be reading through Milton's major poetry and a selection of his prose, in the context of the civil war of mid-century England and with attention to his uniquely influential position in English literary history. In setting out the requisites for reading Milton\u2019s work, I will foreground the contradictory construction of Milton as author: either the last great writer of the Renaissance, a classicist and a Christian, or the first \"modern\" writer, a fierce anti-monarchical revolutionary, closer in his religious views to the radical sectarians than to the Puritan parliamentarians who initiated the war against the King. In addition to Milton\u2019s works, we will read a selection of the most relevant of Milton\u2019s contemporaries, along with a mix of older and more recent literary scholarship. My aim is to understand Milton\u2019s political, theological, and literary positions, as well as the typical misunderstandings of Milton propagated in literary history.           Engl.GA.3536.001   Genres/Concepts/Media: Literature and Knowledge Since the Enlightenment    Cliff Siskin   Monday 3:30-6:00pm---244 Greene Street, Room 306     If you were doing your doctorate in the UK, you would not be taking two years of courses and exams before writing your dissertation; you would just start writing. To take advantage of this difference\u2014and to avoid just replicating or extending your undergraduate experience\u2014you need to figure out what your graduate courses can do for you. This course has two goals. The first is to provide you with three interrelated tools that can help answer the question facing all graduate students: what does it mean to become an expert in literary study? If lawyers know the law, what do we know about the literary and how do we know it? Our first stop will be genre: whatever our chosen period, we experience the literary through a long history of forms\u2014how can we gain and produce knowledge about those forms? How do they work? How do they change? Second is concepts: what do those forms communicate? Can we develop an expert vocabulary for how meaning is constructed and for how those constructions change? We\u2019ll benefit here from seminars with one of the Department\u2019s visiting research faculty, Professor Peter De Bolla of Cambridge, author of a new book on The Architecture of Concepts. Our third stop is the term that has made its way into more and more job descriptions as we advance into the digital: what role should media play in literary study? The course\u2019s second goal is to bring those three tools to bear on a set of texts and authors that will be chosen partly by me and partly by you. Our historical focus should be useful for those with current interests in earlier periods and later ones, for it covers that swath of literary history that links the two: from the late seventeenth century through the Enlightenment and into its legacy in modernity.

Engl.GA.3629.001   Politics in Deconstruction    Geoffrey Bennington   Wednesday 6:20-8:20pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work, this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other contemporary theories. Classic authors to be discussed will include Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Rousseau, Kant, Hegel and Schmitt; more recent theorists to be considered alongside Derrida may include Agamben, Badiou, Foucault, Hardt and Negri, Lyotard, Mouffe and Ranci\u00e8re.

Guided Research and MA Thesis Form             Engl.GA.1083 x-listed with Irish Studies   Literature of Modern Ireland    John Waters   Monday 3:30-6:00pm \u2013Ireland House, Room 101     This course conducts a comprehensive survey of the traditions of writing in Ireland from the plantations of the late sixteenth century to the famine of 1846-50. By tracing the shadow of Irish language literary traditions in and alongside the emerging Irish literary traditions in English, we will consider the interplay of literature and national identity, and the role of literature and other forms of print culture in a variety of social processes, including politicization, the language shift, and textual representations of violence, domestic life, cultural memory, national and international economy, and forms of agency. Major authors including Jonathan Swift, Bishop Berkeley, Edmund Burke, Maria Edgeworth, Sydney Owenson, Thomas Moore, Samuel Ferguson, and James Clarence Mangan are considered, as well as the development of Irish forms of poetry, drama, and prose in English. It is the aim of the course to give students a detailed grasp of Irish literary history before the cataclysmic social changes wrought by the Irish famine, and to introduce students to the concepts and terminology employed in contemporary Irish literary scholarship.           Engl.GA.1957.001   Textuality    Perry Meisel   Monday 6:20-8:20pm\u201419 UP, Room 222     An introduction to literary theory from structuralism, deconstruction, and psychoanalysis to New Historicism and post-colonialism. Readings will include basic texts by Saussure, Barthes, Bakhtin, Derrida, Althusser, Lacan, Foucault, and Fanon. Philosophical tradition from Hegel to Freud will contextualize what is a single movement of thought defined by continuity rather than by ruptures. The course will begin and endwith literary texts, including Shakespeare, to measure what the theoretical tradition brings to both practical criticism and literary and cultural history. Open to both graduate students and advanced undergraduates.           Engl.GA.2075.001 MA Thesis Writing Colloquium Maureen N. McLane Wednesday, 5-7pm An intense yet convivial biweekly seminar for MA students to support them as they pursue research and write their MA Theses. This seminar will feature short writing assignments and deadlines all geared to the completion of the thesis; peer review of drafts; research/library excursions; some brief yet methodologically stimulating readings--from, e.g., Moretti, Bakhtin, inter alia. Students' projects will affect, and be reflected in, the course syllabus. The main project of this seminar is to create an intellectual, sociable community for MA students as they pursue their writing and research.

MEDI-GA-2100.002   Old English    Michael Matto Monday 6:20-8:20pm     This course is designed for students who are interested in the language, literature, and culture of England up to the Norman Conquest of 1066. It will provide solid practice in the language and close reading of texts, both canonical and not-quite-canonical, while introducing students to cultural and historical backgrounds, representative secondary material, and the reception of the Middle Ages in the modern era.     Students should contact MARC Administrator Crystal Parsons for registration access.           Engl.GA.2521.001   Cultural Institutions in Restoration England    Bill Blake   Thursday 6:20-8:20pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     This course will look at British literature of the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries alongside a range of new cultural agendas\u2014from the banding together of a small group of libertine radicals to the formation of an evangelical culture of moral reform; from the invention of \u201chigh\u201d culture to the rise of literary professionalism, even as the arts themselves were changing under the impetus of democratization and liberal values. With a special focus on drama and theatre, primary texts will include plays and critical writings by John Milton, William Davenant, Margaret Cavendish, John Dryden, William Wycherley, Aphra Behn, Thomas Otway, William Congreve, Susanna Centlivre, Joseph Addison, and John Dennis. Our supplemental reading will build on various theoretical formulations\u2014systems theory, discourse analysis, cultural sociology, the history of concepts\u2014to explore how new institutions, new policies, new cultural producers, and new audiences transformed both the forms and practices of public art during this period.           Engl.GA.2661.001 Victorian Studies: The Victorian Nervous/System    Jeff Spear   Thursday 4:00-6:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     This seminar will explore three overlapping areas of both social and personal anxiety in the Victorian period: class, gender and the permeability of the body and body politic as expressed in, for example, Dracula and Conan Doyle\u2019s The Sign of the Four. We will begin with theory: Taussig on the Nervous/System, Benjamin \u201cOn History,\u201d and Mitchell on \u201cEkphrasis and Other.\u201d The course readings will include work by Carlyle (Past and Present), Carroll, Gaskell North and South)Dickens (Oliver) Ruskin, Collins (No Name),Tennyson, (Maud) D.G. Rossetti, G. Eliot (Mill on the Floss) \u201cGeorge Egerton\u201cand the New Woman. The last week will be devoted to visual and popular culture. Each week will have some contextual critical or historical reading.     The main course requirements are contributions to the weekly discussion board, an oral presentation with bibliography on the reading for one week and a term paper on the model of a journal article. Students who are not planning to apply to a PhD program in English can propose an alternative term project equivalent to the scholarly article project.           Engl.GA.2838.001   The Slave\u2019s Story    Elizabeth McHenry   Thursday 10:00-12:00pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     \u201cAmerica has the mournful honor of adding a new department to the literature of civilization,\u2014the autobiographies of escaped slaves,\u201d wrote Ephraim Peabody in his 1849 essay, \u201cNarratives of Fugitive Slaves.\u201d \u201cWe know not where one who wishes to write a modern Odyssey could find a better subject than in the adventures of a fugitive slave.\u201d This course will examine these adventures\u2014slave narratives\u2014from their emergence in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century, to their modern counterparts, the contemporary narratives of slavery that echo and are influenced by the genre, as well as the vibrant imaginings of fugitive narratives in contemporary art and film. By looking at the slave\u2019s story as it has been written into the American literary landscape in both the 19th and 20th centuries, we will explore the premise that underlies Peabody\u2019s 1849 statement: how or in what ways does the deployment of slavery as a literary subject make art \u201cmodern\u201d? Our work will revolve in part around examining the tensions that developed in the 19th century for slave narrators between communicating the material conditions of slavery and the dynamics of systems of slavery as they related to the making and unmaking of American citizens, and participating in evolving debates about the scope\u2014social, political, aesthetic\u2014of literary arts. In the second part of the semester we will contrast the tropes and modes of 19th century slave narratives with re-visions of slavery in 20th century texts, to see how, for instance, rebellions and resistance are re-imagined in retrospect and how the forms and meanings of freedom differ from 19th century slave narratives. Student should expect to read or reread several of the most critically acclaimed slave narratives; but a primary interest will be to examine narratives that have received less critical attention, with an eye toward identifying the literary and historical contexts of slave narratives, the complex conditions of their authorship and publication, and their key generic and aesthetic features. How can these lesser-known texts to help us to deconstruct what we think we know about the slave narrative? As twenty-first century scholars of American and African American literature, revisiting the slave narrative will provide a way to question the assessments of twentieth century critics of this genre, including the very fundamental question of whether slave narratives can be conceived of as a coherent literary genre at all.           Engl.GA.2841.001   American Fiction to 1900-1945    Jo Hendin   Thursday 3:30-5:30pm--244 Greene Street, Room 105     American fiction in this period embodies the variety and anxiety of an era of rapid change. How writers and critics attempted to define and respond to the idea of the \u201cnew\u201d or the \u201ctransformed\u201d illuminates specific works of literary art and the cultural contexts in which they were created. In literary practice and critical discourse, passages from realism to naturalism to modernism, and the reinvention of forms in an era of variety and synthesis, help shape the imagination of domestic and political reality. Through readings in fiction and selected critical essays, this course explores an aesthetic of change forged by working artists and analyzed by critics. The course is intended as a survey of forms and practices with an emphasis on modernism and contemporary, eclectic style.           Engl.GA.2900.001 x-listed with Comp Lit   Reading the Global South: Uneven Development, Critical Geography, and Anti-Imperial Thinking    Ana Dopico   Tuesday 1:00-3:00pm\u201419UP, Room 229     This course seeks to create a comparative ground for cultural politics typically separated by language, imperial histories, and neo-colonial maps. It takes up the cultural, political, historical and theoretical consequences of uneven development as an enduring truth of the global order. It engages the politics and economies of imperialism and the history and theory of anti-imperialism. We will consider the idea of the Global South as a topography of uneven development and uneven temporalities, where notions of modernity and periphery are affirmed and contested and where the names and practices of resistance, rebellion, and critique continue to engage not only metropolitan centers but the force of the state. The course looks beyond \u201carea studies\u201d definitions and seeks a materialist and critical geography, turning toward a hemispheric Southern critique that challenged empire, globalization, democratization, neoliberalism and permanent warfare long before the current political moment. We will trace the political and critical genealogies, the disciplinary canonizations, and the popular life of an indispensable contestatory archive\u2014an archive whose long history helps to contextualize and demystify the geopolitics of the present, as well as the politics of the academy. The course is in part designed to offer comparatists and students from varied fields an engagement with texts whose messy political engagements and materialist foundations have lately been rather marginalized by a reaffirmation of theoretical universals.      We will consider how old ideological mappings like third world, underdevelopment, revolution and old imperial and cold wars continue to haunt new articulations of triumphalist or cataclysmic futures and geopolitical destinies. The course traces themes and variations of a global anti-imperialism, its constituencies, and its critical strategies; it stresses how these contestatory narratives have irrevocably altered the cultural politics and cultural markets of international metropoli and international policy. It seeks also to distinguish \u201csouthern\u201d contexts for struggles around feminism, race and labor, and to follow the trajectory of these struggles into a theoretical \u201cmainstream\u201d. Readings establish connections between nationalist struggles, critiques of hegemony, and resistant narratives, looking back over almost a century of foundational texts from Luxemburg to Gramsci, to Mari\u00e1tegui, to Fanon and Memmi and connecting them to the work of writers as varied as Said, Chatterjee, Garc\u00eda Canclini, Pratt, Spivak, Jameson and Appadurai. The course will proceed thematically as a wide survey of history, criticism, and theory but always considering forms of cultural production that often precede and exceed theorization.           Engl.GA.2902.001   Writing Africa    Lucy Graham   Tuesdays 3:30-5:30pm--244 Greene Street, Room 105              This course focuses on a selection of texts about Africa, from the mid twentieth century until the present day. Beginning with African liberation theory, we shall read some of the writings of Leopold Senghor, Frantz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Nelson Mandela and Steve Biko. The second part of the course will move on to discuss classic or canonical African novels, such as Chinua Achebe\u2019s Things Fall Apart (1958) and Ngugi wa Thiong'o\u2019s A Grain of Wheat (1967). In the third section we shall discuss contemporary theorizing of the African postcolony by writers such as Achille Mbembe, and postcolonial metafiction such as Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\u2019s Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa\u2019s The Book of Chameleons (2004) and Phaswane Mpe\u2019s Welcome to our Hillbrow (2001). In the final weeks of the course we shall discuss films about Africa, including: The Battle of Algiers (1966), directed by Gillo Pontecorvo and based on the writings of Fanon; Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty\u2019s Hyenas (2004), a bitingly satirical allegory of the effects of the IMF and World Bank in Africa, Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne\u2019s Moolaad\u00e9 (2004); as well as the South African film Hijack Stories (2000), co-written by Oliver Schmitz and Lesego Rampolokeng.           Engl.GA.2957.001   Queer Affect Theory    Jonathan Flatley   Tuesday, 12:00-2:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306      This seminar will examine the relationship between queer theory and the \u201caffective turn\u201d in the humanities and social sciences. The intersection between these two vital areas of scholarly inquiry is perhaps marked most clearly by Eve Sedgwick\u2019s turn toward affect, represented by her essay on shame and queer performativity in Henry James (in the first issue of GLQ, 1993), her co-editing (with Adam Frank) of the work of Silvan Tomkins (Shame and Its Sisters, 1995) and her subsequent work on Melanie Klein, the depressive position, and reparative reading. But understandings of feeling had already been important in some of the writing from which queer theory emerged: Audre Lorde on anger and the erotic in Sister Outsider; Michel Foucault\u2019s critique of the repressive hypothesis and his emphasis on bodies, pleasures and friendship; and writing by Douglas Crimp, Leo Bersani and others on sex, mourning and militancy in relation to AIDS and ACT-UP. After reading these foundational works, we will consider to what extent and with what implications queerness has subsequently been understood as a particular kind or mode of feeling. For instance, in asking whether some experience of melancholia or depression is central to queerness we will read works by Freud, Melanie Klein, Butler, Sedgwick, Crimp, Ann Cvetkovich, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, and Heather Love. In considering optimism, collectivity, happiness, activism, love, the death drive, utopia, shame and stigma we will also read work by Theresa de Lauretis, Gloria Anzaldua, Sara Ahmed, Lauren Berlant, Lee Edelman, Mel Chen, Deborah Gould, Sianne Ngai, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Luc Nancy, and Paolo Virno. Although we will focus mainly on critical and theoretical works, we will also decide together on a range of aesthetic objects to anchor our discussion through the semester.           Engl.GA.2971.001   Practicum in Digital Humanities: Mapping Archives: Cultural Geographies of New York City    Tom Augst   Tuesday 6:20-8:20pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     Drawing on materials at NYU Libraries, this course introduces students to concepts, methods, and tools for spatial analysis of the archival record. Exploring digital tools, resources, and research practices for mapping and visualization, the course will focus on interpreting and representing diverse forms of evidence: textual and nontextual, scribal and printed, qualitative and quantitative, institutional and personal. Applying critical and theoretical perspectives, students will participate in a lab component for the course, designed to build competencies in the use of computational methods for understanding and manipulating data in the humanities. Although course exercises and discussions will focus on modeling a collaborative research platform related to New York City, students will have opportunities to develop research goals related to individual areas and periods of scholarly interest.             Engl.GA.2980.001   MA Pro-Seminar    Juliet Fleming   Wednesday 11:00-1:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     Criticism Practical and Impractical     Practical criticism is a method of close reading designed to enhance our responsiveness to what we read. It develops a knowledge of literary forms, and provides technical language for describing the ways in which writers achieve their effects. As prescribed by I. A. Richards in the 1920s it treats literature as something separate from social and economic spheres and from the personal concerns of its author: had you taken an exam prepared by the followers of Richards at Cambridge you would have been required to produce a close analysis of, organised response to, and finally judgement of three pieces of literary writing that were unnamed and undated. Part of the work of this seminar will be to prepare you for (a modified version of) that exam -- and, beyond that, for a career founded upon your skills of close reading and your ability to recognise the presence and consequences of literary forms, metres, punctuation, rhyme schemes, diction, syntax and layout. In every meeting we will practice reading, talking and writing about literary forms. The other part of our work will be to familiarise ourselves with a different type of close-reading, one that is famously not a method, and that eschews the pleasures of judgment. Deconstruction is the unsatisfactory name for what is, above all, a heightened commitment to reading -- one that refuses the limits of any criticism that would be practical but that nevertheless offers a profound education in thinking about literary texts. Throughout the semester we will use Derrida's writing to lighten, baffle, enrich and deflect our own developing attempts at literary analysis and judgment.           Engl.GA.2980.002   MA Pro-Seminar    Maureen McLane   Wednesday 4:00-6:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306      What is Literature? Why study \u201cit\u201d? How study \u201cit\u201d? Does \u201cliterature\u201d exist? How has it been, how is it now, and how might it yet be studied, imagined, engaged, and/or critiqued? And how might advanced literary study be inflected by other advanced studies\u2014of, for example, media history and ecology, book history, historiography, the human sciences (linguistics, psychoanalysis, anthropology)? This course offers a series of intense experimental gambits: with assigned readings in a variety of methodological and theoretical keys, from a range of historical periods, we will begin to consider where literary study has been, where it is, and where it might be going. We will engage the pleasure of the text and the rigor of the text and may confront as well the displeasure of the text: our task will be to register each of these possibilities.           Engl.GA.3323.001   Topics in Renaissance Lit: Milton    John Guillory   Monday 1:00-3:00pm\u2014244 Greene Street, Room 306     In this seminar we will be reading through Milton's major poetry and a selection of his prose, in the context of the civil war of mid-century England and with attention to his uniquely influential position in English literary history. In setting out the requisites for reading Milton\u2019s work, I will foreground the contradictory construction of Milton as author: either the last great writer of the Renaissance, a classicist and a Christian, or the first \"modern\" writer, a fierce anti-monarchical revolutionary, closer in his religious views to the radical sectarians than to the Puritan parliamentarians who initiated the war against the King. In addition to Milton\u2019s works, we will read a selection of the most relevant of Milton\u2019s contemporaries, along with a mix of older and more recent literary scholarship. My aim is to understand Milton\u2019s political, theological, and literary positions, as well as the typical misunderstandings of Milton propagated in literary history.           Engl.GA.3536.001   Genres/Concepts/Media: Literature and Knowledge Since the Enlightenment    Cliff Siskin   Monday 3:30-6:00pm---244 Greene Street, Room 306     If you were doing your doctorate in the UK, you would not be taking two years of courses and exams before writing your dissertation; you would just start writing. To take advantage of this difference\u2014and to avoid just replicating or extending your undergraduate experience\u2014you need to figure out what your graduate courses can do for you. This course has two goals. The first is to provide you with three interrelated tools that can help answer the question facing all graduate students: what does it mean to become an expert in literary study? If lawyers know the law, what do we know about the literary and how do we know it? Our first stop will be genre: whatever our chosen period, we experience the literary through a long history of forms\u2014how can we gain and produce knowledge about those forms? How do they work? How do they change? Second is concepts: what do those forms communicate? Can we develop an expert vocabulary for how meaning is constructed and for how those constructions change? We\u2019ll benefit here from seminars with one of the Department\u2019s visiting research faculty, Professor Peter De Bolla of Cambridge, author of a new book on The Architecture of Concepts. Our third stop is the term that has made its way into more and more job descriptions as we advance into the digital: what role should media play in literary study? The course\u2019s second goal is to bring those three tools to bear on a set of texts and authors that will be chosen partly by me and partly by you. Our historical focus should be useful for those with current interests in earlier periods and later ones, for it covers that swath of literary history that links the two: from the late seventeenth century through the Enlightenment and into its legacy in modernity. Please contact me with suggestions for texts that will help you with your specific goals. MA students who are thinking about this course should also get in touch.           Engl.GA.3629.001   Politics in Deconstruction    Geoffrey Bennington   Wednesday 6:20-8:20pm--244 Greene Street, Room 306     Taking its lead from some of Derrida\u2019s later work, this course will set off again from Aristotle\u2019s famous characterization of man as a zoon politikon, and follow the threads of sovereignty and democracy through some of the great texts of political philosophy in the Western tradition. We shall attempt to understand why both of these notions pose such problems for that tradition, and give rise to all manner of complications and paradoxes, which turn out to be definitive of the conceptual space of the political as such. We shall wonder why almost all traditional political philosophers are enamored of sovereignty, while almost none has anything very good to say about democracy. We shall consider the possibility of a non-trivial affinity between the political, the rhetorical, the literary, and animality in their constant tendency to exceed conceptual grasp, and also compare our deconstructive approach to these political questions with some other contemporary theories.
