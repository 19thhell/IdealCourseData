East Coast Artists\u2019 training has been based on the principle that performers and directors can share a language of the body that not only bonds the group through the creation of ensemble, but also provides specific tools for rehearsal and composition. An important aspect of the work is concerned with the act of performance itself and with deep questions about self, identity and one\u2019s participation in groups. Based on training and performance techniques developed by Richard Schechner, daily practice includes rigorous yoga, breath and vocal exercises, employs text and personal material, as well as movement and sound as points of initiation for composition. Students work closely with East Coast Artists\u2019 accomplished performers and directors to create solo performances and group compositions.    A significant portion of the workshop is dedicated to the RasaBoxes\u2122exercises, devised by Schechner. The exercises comprise a psychophysical approach that begins with finding form for nine basic emotional-energetic archetypes through the use of body and the breath. The work then leads to sound and movement exercises, relating to objects and others, language and text exercises, and finally to scene work and the layering and scoring of rasas to create complex characters, to explore and compose scenes, to create choreography and entire performances.

English      Synopsis: This performer-training workshop features the rasaboxes exercise devised by Richard Schechner. Michele Minnick and Paula Murray      Cole lead the workshop in a yoga warmup, intensive breathing and vocal exercises, slow-motion and other exercises invented      or adapted by Schechner, and finally the rasaboxes. Taken as a whole, the workshop is an exploration of psycho-physical embodiments      connecting the personal to the social. Rasaboxes offer a unique approach that begins with finding a particular form for the      eight basic emotions as specified in the Sanskrit theatre manual, Bharata's 'Natyasastra.' In the workshop documented in the      film, four student participants along with the instructors commence with a warm up and then draw words and pictures in each      of eight connected rectangular boxes mapped out on the floor with masking tape. The ninth, the center box, is left blank because      it represents 'shanta,' the ultimate emotionless state of total bliss. Rasaboxes combines the Indian concept with Antonin Artaud's call for the actor to be 'an athlete of the emotions.' The eight,      or nine, rasas of Sanskrit/Indian performance theory are: adbhuta (surprise, wonder), sringara (love, eros), bhayanaka (fear,      horror), bibhatsa (disgust, revulsion), vira (courage, the heroic), hasya (laughter, the comic), karuna (sadness, compassion),      raudra (rage, destruction), and santa (peace, bliss). Workshop participants move within the boxes, jumping from one emotional      state to the other and at times engaging interactively. Richard Schechner is a theater director, performance theorist and      university professor known for being one of the founders of the academic discipline of Performance Studies at Tisch School      of the Arts, New York University. Schechner combines his work in anthropology with innovative approaches to performance of      all kinds including ritual, drama, environmental theater, political rallies, dance, music, etc. in order to consider how performance can be understood not just as an object of study, but also as an active intellectual-artistic      practice. He is the editor of 'TDR: The Journal of Performance Studies.' His books include 'Environmental Theater,' 'The Future      of Ritual,' 'Performance Theory,' 'Between Theater and Anthropology' and 'Performance Studies: An Introduction.' As of 2007,      his books have been translated into 14 languages.
