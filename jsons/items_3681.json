Each track requires that students complete five upper-level Biology electives. In consultation with their adviser or with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students select at least one course from each of the following four skill categories, plus a fifth elective from any one of the categories: Lab Skill Courses, Quantitative Skill Courses, Reasoning Skill Courses and Foundational Courses.      This page lists the courses that satisfy each category for the standard track and the Ecology track, and the semester in which they are usually offered. It also lists courses that serve as electives for the Global Public Health/Science major with concentration in Biology. Courses that will be offered in Fall 2013 are in bold . Graduate (BIOL-GA) courses may be taken with permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Links to recommended four-year course plans are also provided.      Occasionally a new course will be offered as Special Topics in Biology (BIOL-UA 910, 912, 914 , 920, 922, 924, 930, 932, 934 , 940, 942, or 944). The course numbers signify the semester offered ( Fall = 910, 912, 914, 930, 932, 934 ; Spring = 920, 922, 924, 940, 942, 944) and the category the course satisfies for the standard track (Foundational = 910 , 920; Reasoning = 912 , 922; Quantitative = 914 , 924) or the Ecology track (Foundational = 930 , 940; Reasoning = 932 , 942; Quantitative = 934 , 944).      Please use the information on this page and the [link to Fall-Spring Course Offerings] to assist you in planning a TENTATIVE course schedule. Because course offerings are subject to change, you might need to revise your course planning accordingly.

Each track requires that students complete five upper-level Biology electives. In consultation with their adviser or with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students select at least one course from each of the following four skill categories, plus a fifth elective from any one of the categories: Lab Skill Courses, Quantitative Skill Courses, Reasoning Skill Courses and Foundational Courses.      This page lists the courses that satisfy each category for the standard track and the Ecology track, and the semester in which they are usually offered. It also lists courses that serve as electives for the Global Public Health/Science major with concentration in Biology. Courses that will be offered in Fall 2013 are in bold . Graduate (BIOL-GA) courses may be taken with permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Links to recommended four-year course plans are also provided.      Occasionally a new course will be offered as Special Topics in Biology (BIOL-UA 910, 912, 914 , 920, 922, 924, 930, 932, 934 , 940, 942, or 944). The course numbers signify the semester offered ( Fall = 910, 912, 914, 930, 932, 934 ; Spring = 920, 922, 924, 940, 942, 944) and the category the course satisfies for the standard track (Foundational = 910 , 920; Reasoning = 912 , 922; Quantitative = 914 , 924) or the Ecology track (Foundational = 930 , 940; Reasoning = 932 , 942; Quantitative = 934 , 944).      Please use the information on this page and the [link to Fall-Spring Course Offerings] to assist you in planning a TENTATIVE course schedule.

Each track requires that students complete five upper-level Biology electives. In consultation with their adviser or with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, students select at least one course from each of the following four skill categories, plus a fifth elective from any one of the categories: Lab Skill Courses, Quantitative Skill Courses, Reasoning Skill Courses and Foundational Courses.      This page lists the courses that satisfy each category for the standard track and the Ecology track, and the semester in which they are usually offered. It also lists courses that serve as electives for the Global Public Health/Science major with concentration in Biology. Courses that will be offered in Fall 2013 are in bold . Graduate (BIOL-GA) courses may be taken with permission of the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Links to recommended four-year course plans are also provided.      Occasionally a new course will be offered as Special Topics in Biology (BIOL-UA 910, 912, 914 , 920, 922, 924, 930, 932, 934 , 940, 942, or 944).

The  major in Biology is an integrated yet diverse program that builds a solid  foundation in modern biology through coursework in molecular biology, cell  biology, evolution, genetics, developmental biology, physiology, immunology, genomics,  systems biology, computational biology, ecology and environmental biology. From  the very outset of their studies, students are exposed to modern concepts and  state-of-the-art experimental and analytical methods. Upper-level courses emphasize  foundational knowledge as well as laboratory skills, reasoning skills and  quantitative skills. Advanced students may register for graduate-level courses,  which are most often given in the specialized areas of faculty research.      The department also offers  a set of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of  molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and  environmental biology. Each minor is designed to hone skills in a particular  contemporary area of biology and requires a laboratory experience. The minors  permit students to create a course of study that will meet their unique  academic and career goals.      This program provides  outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry,  and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of  success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable  careers in the biomedical sciences.      Other courses offered by  the department are designed to acquaint nonscience majors with contemporary  issues in biology. Such courses are often topical, addressing problems such as  environmental pollution, limits of the earth, and human physiology.      Outstanding and highly  motivated students are offered special opportunities for honors work,  independent study, summer laboratory research, internships, and other  enhancements. Upper-level students may become involved in research projects in  faculty laboratories through the many formal and informal opportunities  afforded by the department. The department has a tradition of important  research accomplishment and contains several specialized research and  laboratory facilities that are integrated into the educational programs. These  include undergraduate labs in molecular biology, cell biology, experimental  physiology, genomics, bioinformatics and ecological analysis. Field studies are  carried out at a variety of regional sites. Department faculty are also  affiliated with the NYU Center for Genomics  and Systems Biology ,  the NYU Center for  Developmental Genetics ,   NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences , the NYU School of Medicine ,  the NYU College of Dentistry , the American Museum of  Natural History , the New York Botanical Garden , and Cold Spring Harbor  Laboratory .      Students with questions about majoring in Biology or minoring in  a specific area of biology should visit the office of the Department of  Biology. Those declaring a major in Biology are assigned a faculty adviser from  the department; students meet with that professor to design a program of study,  determine course selections, and discuss career goals. The faculty adviser is  also available to provide guidance concerning the many options and  opportunities afforded by the department for curricular enhancement, including  research experiences.      Major (Bachelor of Arts)      The Department offers two tracks. The standard biology  track provides the major with a broad background in biology with the  laboratory, quantitative and reasoning skills needed for today\u2019s modern  biology. The ecology track also provides students with the broad background in  modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches and  analytical methods.      In addition, students may pursue a major in Global Public  Health/Science, with a concentration in Biology (see below).      The following sixteen courses (typically 70 points) completed  with grades of C or higher (and a minimum GPA of 2.0 for all courses required  by and taken as electives in the major) are required for the major.      To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level  courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and   II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories   (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and mathematics in their freshman year. Then as sophomores,  students in the standard track should take Molecular and Cell Biology   (BIOL-UA 21, 22), whereas students in the ecology track should take Fundamentals  of Ecology (BIOL-UA 63).      Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department  adviser.

Minor in Molecular and Cell Biology : BIOL-UA 11, 12, 21 and 22; either  BIOL-UA 123 or BIOL-UA 223; either At the Bench: Applied Molecular Biology   (BIOL-UA 36) or At the Bench: Applied Cell Biology (BIOL-UA 37)      Minor in Genetics : BIOL-UA 11, 12 and 21; either BIOL-UA 123 or BIOL-UA  223; either Genetics (BIOL-UA 30) or Quantitative Methods in Human    Genetics (BIOL-UA 45); At the Bench: Laboratory in Genetics   (BIOL-UA 31)      Minor in Genomics and Bioinformatics : BIOL-UA 11, 12 and 21; either  BIOL-UA 123 or BIOL-UA 223; Genome Biology (BIOL-UA 38); one of the  following: Microbiology and Microbial Genomics (BIOL-UA 44), Bioinformatics  and Genomes (BIOL-GA 1127), or Systems Biology (BIOL-GA 1128)      Minor in Environmental Biology : BIOL-UA 11, 12; BIOL-UA 123, or the  equivalent; one of the following laboratory courses: Ecological Field  Methods (BIOL-UA 16), Urban Ecology (BIOL-UA 18) or Ecological  Analysis with Geographic Information Systems (BIOL-UA 64); two of the  following: Evolution (BIOL-UA 58), Fundamentals of Ecology   (BIOL-UA 63), Biogeochemistry of Global Change (BIOL-UA 66), or Current  Topics in Earth System Sciences (BIOL-UA 332).          Honors  Program Candidates for a degree with honors in biology must have an  overall GPA of at least 3.65 and a minimum 3.65 GPA in all science and  mathematics courses required for the major. It is the student's responsibility  to secure a faculty member to sponsor the research and to provide laboratory  space and equipment. All research credits should be completed by the end of the  junior year.      Required Courses for Honor\u2019s  Program: In addition to the courses required for the Biology major,  students must also complete the following three courses (8 credits)      4-Point Research Credit: Either  Independent Study (BIOL-UA 997, 998) or Internship (BIOL-UA 980, 981).  Department approval of laboratory-based research is required. Research credit  must be completed before registering into BIOL-UA 999. Application forms can be  picked up at the department.      Becoming a Scientist (BIOL-UA  995): Two-credit course must be taken in the Fall semester before graduation.      Undergraduate Research Thesis  Course (BIOL-UA 999):Two-credit course must be taken in the final  semester. Students prepare a written thesis based on the research results from  their independent study or internship experience and defend the thesis at an  oral examination before a faculty committee. Application forms, available at the  biology departmental office, must be submitted by the beginning of the final  semester.          Graduate  Courses A number of courses in specialized fields are given at the  graduate level. Courses at the BIOL-GA 1000 level are available to  undergraduates who have the necessary prerequisites. To take any of the  relevant BIOL-GA 1000-level graduate courses in Biology, students must obtain  the signature of the course instructor and the Director of Undergraduate  Studies and have their registration material approved in the department's  graduate office.          Advanced  Placement Students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the College Entrance  Examination Board Advanced Placement Examination are exempted from taking any  Principles of Biology sequence. However, because of medical-school  requirements, students on the pre-health track should not place out of  Principles of Biology.          Suggested  Course Plans For reference, suggested four-year course plans for Biology  majors, including those on the pre-health track and those in the Global Public  Health/Science major with concentration in Biology, are available on the  official web site of the Department of Biology.          Study  Away Opportunities for study away that are appropriate for  Biology majors are available on the official web site of the Department of  Biology.
