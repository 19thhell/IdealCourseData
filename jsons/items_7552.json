Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.                              Language Courses   All students at NYU Tel Aviv will be required to take a course in either Hebrew or Arabic language. This course must be taken for graded credit. (Not pass/fail.) For native speakers or those who have already achieved an advanced level of proficiency, special arrangements will be made (e.g. direct enrollment in a pre-approved course at a local university, directed readings, or special tutorial sessions).                                                  The Languages of Israel - HBRJD-UA 9140 or MEIS-UA 9150 - 4 points                               This course also fulfills the language requirement for Global Programs.   Is Israel a multilingual or a monolingual country? This is a question with which many educators, linguists, politicians and laypeople have been struggling. In this course we will explore several issues of language use and practice in Israel, language ideology and language policy.   We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.

This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.                                                                    Internship Seminar and Fieldwork - SCA-UA 9042 or INDIV-UG 9550 - 4 points                                     Course includes weekly seminar and minimum of 10 hours fieldwork/ week at approved internship field-site.    The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

Is Israel a multilingual or a monolingual country? This is a question with which many educators, linguists, politicians and laypeople have been struggling. In this course we will explore several issues of language use and practice in Israel, language ideology and language policy.   We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.

The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.

Israel: Fact through Film and Fiction - HBRJD-UA 9TBA - 4 points - Under Development                               Israeli Cinema has finally come of age. It has caught up with Israeli literature, scoring awards and world-wide recognition not only for its artistic achievements but also for its gutsy in-depth engagement with political, social, and sex-and-gender borders and boundaries that are local and universal at one and the same time. The course will explore some of these issues as they are tackled in contemporary cinema and fiction. Classes will be organized in three thematic clusters:     \u201cFamily, I Love and Hate You\u201d   \u201cThe Political is Personal Too\u201d: War, Terror, Self-sacrifice   Crossing the Lines: Trauma, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity       (This grouping is determined by what seems to be a work\u2019s major theme, though most of works studied, and certainly the best among them, are bi- or multi-focal, crossing several boundaries of universal divisions.)   When appropriate, students will be asked to prepare relevant backgrounds materials \u2013 socio- historical studies, reviews, etc.                                History                                                    History of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict - HIST-UA 9553 or HBRJD-UA 9948 or MEIS-UA 9751 - 4 points                               This course will take the students through the history and the various realities and challenges of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

We will cover topics such as democracy origins, consolidation, transitions to democracy, democratization processes, origins of dictatorships, role of institutions in dictatorships, etc. We will first cover the theoretical foundations of each topic, and then we will give empirical examples.   While many countries in the international system are democratic, the quality of these democracies is questionable and varies considerably across them. Many in some of these democracies suffer from deep levels of corruption, poor elite accountability, human rights abuses and violations, and oftentimes policies that go against the very foundations of democratic governance. We will cover in the course the classic regime types (democracy, hybrid regimes, and dictatorship), transitions between them, and the strategies they (and their leaders) use to stay in power.   Sample Syllabus                                  Tel Aviv University     Tel Aviv University (TAU) is Israel's largest higher education institution and is home to 30,000 students studying in the academic areas of science, humanities and the arts. NYU is pleased to allow students to enroll in TAU courses for NYU credit. This exciting opportunity allows students to engage with local students in the classroom.   Below is a list of courses that are either approved for the current semester or have been approved in the past (as specified). If you are interested in taking courses at TAU that are not listed below, please email global.academics@nyu.edu for more information.                Approved Courses for the Current Semester                                                          Jewish Ethics: Sin, Forgiveness, Repentance - TAU 2302 - 4 points                               In this course, we shall examine basic concepts in Jewish religious ethics through the prism of one foundational concept in this religion - the concept of repentance. Our investigation will evolve around the following questions: How does the Jewish religion understand the notion of sin and what are the implications of these understandings? What exactly is repentance in the Jewish tradition and what are its different components? How is it possible to erase sins that have already been committed? The course will be structured along two parallel lines, First, we shall advance chronologically from an introductory part that deals with ancient notions of sin and repentance to modern understandings of these ideas. Second, the chronological layer will be arranged around thematic sections that include issues such as confession, atonement, forgiveness and self-improvement. As a result, a better understanding of religious subjectivity and Jewish morality will emerge.                                                                      Social and Cultural History of the Modern Middle East - TAU 1201 - 4 points                               If until the last third of the twentieth century history mostly addressed the lives and deeds of \u201cbig men\u201d \u2013 rulers, diplomats, generals, or inventors \u2013 historians have in recent decades gradually broadened their perspective to include in their narratives women, the middle- and then lower classes, and eventually non-Western people as well. Along these lines, this course examines the history of the modern Middle East from the bottom up. We will examine what made the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \u201cmodern\u201d for the inhabitants of the region and what constituted their lived experience of the tumults of colonialism, nationalism and post-colonialism. Exploring case studies from Egypt, Israel\\Palestine, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia among other settings, we will examine the shifting media infrastructures, cultural protocols, religious beliefs, class formations, and political agendas of different social groups in the region. Beyond reading recent and innovative academic literature on these issues, instruction will heavily rely on primary materials such as graffiti, cinema, music and recordings of religious materials, poetry and short stories.

The course examines the archaeological findings, the biblical text and ancient Near Eastern records in an attempt to reconstruct the history of ancient Israel in the first Millennium BCE. The study of ancient Israel in biblical times attracts the imagination of millions around the world. Biblical accounts on kings such as David and Solomon are at the heart of most cultures today and it is no wonder that pure academic debates about the historicity of these biblical accounts echoes into public realm. Can we use archaeology and biblical scholarship in order to reconstruct a better image of these decisive events? Five currently hotly debated subjects in biblical history will be discussed with the students in class meetings, in field trips and with the help of guest speakers who will present their side of the argument.

Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.                              Language Courses   All students at NYU Tel Aviv will be required to take a course in either Hebrew or Arabic language. This course must be taken for graded credit. (Not pass/fail.) For native speakers or those who have already achieved an advanced level of proficiency, special arrangements will be made (e.g. direct enrollment in a pre-approved course at a local university, directed readings, or special tutorial sessions).                                                  The Languages of Israel - HBRJD-UA 9140 or MEIS-UA 9150 - 4 points                               This course also fulfills the language requirement for Global Programs.   Is Israel a multilingual or a monolingual country? This is a question with which many educators, linguists, politicians and laypeople have been struggling. In this course we will explore several issues of language use and practice in Israel, language ideology and language policy.   We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.

Gallatin School of Individualized Study                                                  Ancient Israel: History and Archaeology - Travelers, Collectors and Antiquities Robbers -\u00a0HBRJD-UA\u00a09118 or HIST-UA 9524 or SASEM-UG 9550 - 4 points                               The story of the archaeological discipline in the Land of Israel is strongly tied with the major developments that the region has undergone in the last two centuries. This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.                                                                    Internship Seminar and Fieldwork - SCA-UA 9042 or INDIV-UG 9550 - 4 points                                     Course includes weekly seminar and minimum of 10 hours fieldwork/ week at approved internship field-site.    The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

We will start by learning the orthographies (spelling systems) of Hebrew and Arabic and practice them through the methodology of Linguistic Landscape. We will tour Tel Aviv-Jaffa and other places and study public signs and their use in Hebrew and Arabic as well as in other languages. We will look at signs, advertisements, instructions, buildings, streets, billboards, etc. This exercise will teach us much about the public space, who controls it and what cultural and political messages it sends us.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    History of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict - HIST-UA 9553 or HBRJD-UA 9948 or MEIS-UA 9751 - 4 points                               This course will take the students through the history and the various realities and challenges of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.                                                                    Ancient Israel: History and Archaeology - Travelers, Collectors and Antiquities Robbers -\u00a0HBRJD-UA\u00a09118 or HIST-UA 9524 or SASEM-UG 9550 - 4 points                               The story of the archaeological discipline in the Land of Israel is strongly tied with the major developments that the region has undergone in the last two centuries. This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.                                                                    Israel: Fact through Film and Fiction - HBRJD-UA 9TBA - 4 points - Under Development                               Israeli Cinema has finally come of age. It has caught up with Israeli literature, scoring awards and world-wide recognition not only for its artistic achievements but also for its gutsy in-depth engagement with political, social, and sex-and-gender borders and boundaries that are local and universal at one and the same time. The course will explore some of these issues as they are tackled in contemporary cinema and fiction. Classes will be organized in three thematic clusters:     \u201cFamily, I Love and Hate You\u201d   \u201cThe Political is Personal Too\u201d: War, Terror, Self-sacrifice   Crossing the Lines: Trauma, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity       (This grouping is determined by what seems to be a work\u2019s major theme, though most of works studied, and certainly the best among them, are bi- or multi-focal, crossing several boundaries of universal divisions.)   When appropriate, students will be asked to prepare relevant backgrounds materials \u2013 socio- historical studies, reviews, etc.                                History                                                    History of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict - HIST-UA 9553 or HBRJD-UA 9948 or MEIS-UA 9751 - 4 points                               This course will take the students through the history and the various realities and challenges of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

We will cover topics such as democracy origins, consolidation, transitions to democracy, democratization processes, origins of dictatorships, role of institutions in dictatorships, etc. We will first cover the theoretical foundations of each topic, and then we will give empirical examples.   While many countries in the international system are democratic, the quality of these democracies is questionable and varies considerably across them. Many in some of these democracies suffer from deep levels of corruption, poor elite accountability, human rights abuses and violations, and oftentimes policies that go against the very foundations of democratic governance. We will cover in the course the classic regime types (democracy, hybrid regimes, and dictatorship), transitions between them, and the strategies they (and their leaders) use to stay in power.   Sample Syllabus                                  Tel Aviv University     Tel Aviv University (TAU) is Israel's largest higher education institution and is home to 30,000 students studying in the academic areas of science, humanities and the arts.

Approved Courses for the Current Semester                                                          Jewish Ethics: Sin, Forgiveness, Repentance - TAU 2302 - 4 points                               In this course, we shall examine basic concepts in Jewish religious ethics through the prism of one foundational concept in this religion - the concept of repentance. Our investigation will evolve around the following questions: How does the Jewish religion understand the notion of sin and what are the implications of these understandings? What exactly is repentance in the Jewish tradition and what are its different components? How is it possible to erase sins that have already been committed? The course will be structured along two parallel lines, First, we shall advance chronologically from an introductory part that deals with ancient notions of sin and repentance to modern understandings of these ideas. Second, the chronological layer will be arranged around thematic sections that include issues such as confession, atonement, forgiveness and self-improvement. As a result, a better understanding of religious subjectivity and Jewish morality will emerge.                                                                      Social and Cultural History of the Modern Middle East - TAU 1201 - 4 points                               If until the last third of the twentieth century history mostly addressed the lives and deeds of \u201cbig men\u201d \u2013 rulers, diplomats, generals, or inventors \u2013 historians have in recent decades gradually broadened their perspective to include in their narratives women, the middle- and then lower classes, and eventually non-Western people as well. Along these lines, this course examines the history of the modern Middle East from the bottom up. We will examine what made the nineteenth and twentieth centuries \u201cmodern\u201d for the inhabitants of the region and what constituted their lived experience of the tumults of colonialism, nationalism and post-colonialism. Exploring case studies from Egypt, Israel\\Palestine, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia among other settings, we will examine the shifting media infrastructures, cultural protocols, religious beliefs, class formations, and political agendas of different social groups in the region. Beyond reading recent and innovative academic literature on these issues, instruction will heavily rely on primary materials such as graffiti, cinema, music and recordings of religious materials, poetry and short stories.
