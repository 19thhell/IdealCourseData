But its not just Monday Night Football and weekend games that are making the sight of a Hail Mary pass unbearable. Its fantasy football.    Fantasy football is played via the Internet by some 15 million fans mostly men, according to The Fantasy Sports Trade Association and Harris Interactive polls. Participants construct their dream team by drafting real NFL players to their roster and competing against league members based on NFL players actual performances in games. Some women feel the football fans in their lives are stuck in a fantasy, especially 20-somethings who seem positively obsessed by the game.    Chad spends between 25 to 30 hours a week watching football and playing fantasy, which is pretty insane, said Jamie Ekern, 25, a research associate at a think tank in the Washington, D.C., area. I get annoyed because hes on a Web site all day. Im like, let it go.    Kamilah Priestley, 27, a kindergarten teacher, says her husband of two and a half years, Kareem, wouldnt get up from the computer for anything during a fantasy football draft, much less for her. When they had the draft this season, he was on the computer for four hours straight. He wouldnt eat dinner. He wouldnt even go to the bathroom.    This condition is known as being an armchair quarterback.    Why he would be so involved in the Internet game is beyond me, Priestley said.    The fantasy games have gotten so popular that there are now national competitions like the World Championship of Fantasy Football, more than 30 fantasy football magazines in publication and special segments aired by the NFL.    Greg Ambrosius, president of the FSTA, a nonprofit trade organization headquartered in Missouri, says, Our survey says that 6.5 percent of all adult Americans play fantasy sports in the last year, and more than 90 percent of them play fantasy football.    This translates to an estimated 30 million people in the United States who play fantasy sports, mostly football, according to the Harris Poll. Some of the largest host sites of fantasy football continue to be Yahoo Sports (fantasysports.yahoo.com/), CBS Sportsline.com (www.sportsline.com/fantasy) and ESPN .com (games.espn.go.com/ffl/frontpage).    This is truly a game for the football zealot. Players start by choosing a provider and creating their own league, which is assembled by sending out invitations. Each general manager drafts real-life NFL players to their rosters. This requires research based on last years statistics and this years projections for each players performance. The excitement comes from the competitiveness, the trading of players and a lineup that requires the owners constant attention.    Even women who like football think its gone too far. Jackie Guillory, who calls herself a football girl, said she would never take it to the extremes of making a fake game. Because of fantasy, she complains, ESPN Sports Center is always on. Her boyfriend just bought a football game package for $100 to get additional football channels. Now she worries this will cut into their regular routines. Its a big priority to him, and it means nothing to me, she said.    Whether these men play on leagues with coworkers, college or high school friends, they are committed to the game and are willing to spend countless hours in pursuit of a perfect roster of players.    I see it as a control thing that makes him feel like hes important to the football league, Priestly said with a half laugh. Its a self-esteem booster.    But there are some owners in leagues who are low key. Jackie Dille believes her boyfriend, Gregor, participates in fantasy football just for fun and for the potential to win money, as some guys tend to bet on their players performance.    For him I guess its part of an intellectual pursuit, Dille said, as its a strategic game because its very shaped by who you pick, who you draft and who you play. You are taking part in the game and getting to pretend to be a coach. It seems less passive that way.    Guillory said her boyfriend Brians behavior changes as soon as football season starts. He starts talking about fantasy football a lot and about his opponents (other members on his league) in normal conversation, Guillory said. All during the day, hell go on the computer to get football stats. All I see are his fantasy stats.    What could girls possibly do to equal this? asks Guillory, bursting into laughter. I couldnt even think of an equivalent. Maybe if we had shopping competitions online or something.

Each team is expected to (a) make a  short presentation to the class reporting on their project (15 minutes including  Q&amp;A), and (b) submit a zip  file containing all of their project-related materials (e.g. Excel model files,  PowerPoint presentation files, Word descriptions, etc.)    This page contains links to the zip files submitted by  students in previous semesters, and may be useful in selecting a project idea or  seeing what past presentations have looked like.    The primary input for evaluating team  projects is input from the other students in the class, based on these criteria:       Did the team study an important and   realistic management problem?    Did the team do a good job of   identifying the key issues and choices faced in their project, and tying   these elements to the ideas learned in the course?    Was the team's project challenging, and   did it make good use of modeling skills and techniques from the   course?    Was the team well prepared, and did   they give an overall excellent presentation in terms of speaking style and   visual aids?    Is the team's model useful for   improving managerial decision making?

But its not just Monday Night Football and weekend games that are making the sight of a Hail Mary pass unbearable. Its fantasy football.          By        Dana Lerner         (~796 Words)                    Drl250&#64;nyu&#46;edu                      Its almost halfway through football season, and some women are totally fed up. But its not just Monday Night Football and weekend games that are making the sight of a Hail Mary pass unbearable. Its fantasy football.    Fantasy football is played via the Internet by some 15 million fans mostly men, according to The Fantasy Sports Trade Association and Harris Interactive polls. Participants construct their dream team by drafting real NFL players to their roster and competing against league members based on NFL players actual performances in games. Some women feel the football fans in their lives are stuck in a fantasy, especially 20-somethings who seem positively obsessed by the game.    Chad spends between 25 to 30 hours a week watching football and playing fantasy, which is pretty insane, said Jamie Ekern, 25, a research associate at a think tank in the Washington, D.C., area. I get annoyed because hes on a Web site all day. Im like, let it go.    Kamilah Priestley, 27, a kindergarten teacher, says her husband of two and a half years, Kareem, wouldnt get up from the computer for anything during a fantasy football draft, much less for her. When they had the draft this season, he was on the computer for four hours straight. He wouldnt eat dinner. He wouldnt even go to the bathroom.    This condition is known as being an armchair quarterback.    Why he would be so involved in the Internet game is beyond me, Priestley said.    The fantasy games have gotten so popular that there are now national competitions like the World Championship of Fantasy Football, more than 30 fantasy football magazines in publication and special segments aired by the NFL.    Greg Ambrosius, president of the FSTA, a nonprofit trade organization headquartered in Missouri, says, Our survey says that 6.5 percent of all adult Americans play fantasy sports in the last year, and more than 90 percent of them play fantasy football.    This translates to an estimated 30 million people in the United States who play fantasy sports, mostly football, according to the Harris Poll. Some of the largest host sites of fantasy football continue to be Yahoo Sports (fantasysports.yahoo.com/), CBS Sportsline.com (www.sportsline.com/fantasy) and ESPN .com (games.espn.go.com/ffl/frontpage).    This is truly a game for the football zealot. Players start by choosing a provider and creating their own league, which is assembled by sending out invitations. Each general manager drafts real-life NFL players to their rosters. This requires research based on last years statistics and this years projections for each players performance. The excitement comes from the competitiveness, the trading of players and a lineup that requires the owners constant attention.    Even women who like football think its gone too far. Jackie Guillory, who calls herself a football girl, said she would never take it to the extremes of making a fake game. Because of fantasy, she complains, ESPN Sports Center is always on. Her boyfriend just bought a football game package for $100 to get additional football channels. Now she worries this will cut into their regular routines. Its a big priority to him, and it means nothing to me, she said.    Whether these men play on leagues with coworkers, college or high school friends, they are committed to the game and are willing to spend countless hours in pursuit of a perfect roster of players.    I see it as a control thing that makes him feel like hes important to the football league, Priestly said with a half laugh. Its a self-esteem booster.    But there are some owners in leagues who are low key. Jackie Dille believes her boyfriend, Gregor, participates in fantasy football just for fun and for the potential to win money, as some guys tend to bet on their players performance.    For him I guess its part of an intellectual pursuit, Dille said, as its a strategic game because its very shaped by who you pick, who you draft and who you play. You are taking part in the game and getting to pretend to be a coach. It seems less passive that way.    Guillory said her boyfriend Brians behavior changes as soon as football season starts. He starts talking about fantasy football a lot and about his opponents (other members on his league) in normal conversation, Guillory said. All during the day, hell go on the computer to get football stats. All I see are his fantasy stats.    What could girls possibly do to equal this? asks Guillory, bursting into laughter. I couldnt even think of an equivalent. Maybe if we had shopping competitions online or something.

Each team is expected to (a) make a  short presentation to the class reporting on their project (15 minutes including  Q&amp;A), and (b) submit a zip  file containing all of their project-related materials (e.g. Excel model files,  PowerPoint presentation files, Word descriptions, etc.)    This page contains links to the zip files submitted by  students in previous semesters, and may be useful in selecting a project idea or  seeing what past presentations have looked like.    The primary input for evaluating team  projects is input from the other students in the class, based on these criteria:       Did the team study an important and   realistic management problem?    Did the team do a good job of   identifying the key issues and choices faced in their project, and tying   these elements to the ideas learned in the course?    Was the team's project challenging, and   did it make good use of modeling skills and techniques from the   course?    Was the team well prepared, and did   they give an overall excellent presentation in terms of speaking style and   visual aids?    Is the team's model useful for   improving managerial decision making?

Fantasy Football: The Musical? travels back in time to September 1991, when acid-washed jeans, Ace of Base, and Arsenio Hall were actually taken seriously. The over-ambitious aspiring sports anchor Charlie Berry and the aimless goofball Reginald \u201cStoner\u201d Stone went their separate ways after college. But facing their late-20s with nothing to show for it, they team up to create the greatest sports fan experience of all time: fantasy football. With song titles like \u201cSports is my Religion,\u201d \u201cMan Friends\u201d and \u201cThe 1980s Movie Montage Song,\u201d this bromantic comedy, a 2009 New York Musical Theatre Festival \u201cBest of Fest\u201d Audience Award winner, is about making friends, making gambles, and growing up against a backdrop of \u201cFull House\u201d and parachute pants.   NYU\u2019s production has musical supervision by Brian Usifer and choreography by MK Lawson. Rounding out the creative team are music director Molly Gachignard, scenic designer Michael Schweikardt, costume designer Michelle Humphrey, lighting designer Chris Dallos, and sound designer Craig Kaufman. The cast features NYU Steinhardt Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions\u2019 students Natalie Hinds, Max Pallman, Brett Rigby, Allison Robinson, Will Roland, Tim Shea, and Jordan Stanley.   Fantasy Football: The Musical? is part of the Steinhardt School\u2019s program in vocal performance\u2019s commitment to the development of new musicals. It marks the 11th annual spring \u201cnew musical\u201d \u2013 with past productions going on to further development at the Eugene O\u2019Neill Center, Barrington Stage Company, the New York Musical Theatre Festival (NYMF) and Kansas City Musical Theatre Festival. Writers participating in past workshop productions have won musical theatre awards including the Jonathan Larson Award, Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theatre Writing, Daryl Roth Award, and Ed Kleban Award.
