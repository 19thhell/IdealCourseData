The experience of the Czech Republic has been especially dramatic, and now as relations between Russia and the West worsen, it again finds itself on the frontline of continent-spanning political, economic and ideological rivalries.    This Global Field Intensive course will use the Czech experience to explore this new security challenge -- is it, as some argue, a new cold war? -- and more generally the many ways in which countries' efforts to recreate themselves generate and are hindered by security challenges. To this end, it will consider 'security' very broadly. How far, for example, were the Central European transitions influenced by fears of Russian imperialism and interference? Are these new states able to address crucial human and economic security challenges, from transnational crime and people trafficking to the influx of dirty money and a dependence on Russian energy supplies? What is the importance of bodies such as NATO to them, and how can small, relatively poor countries develop their own intelligence structures?    Using the NYU Prague Center as a base, students will engage with policy makers, journalists, diplomats, academics, NGO staff and the rich history of Prague and the Czech Republic, in both formal meetings and personal field research on their own projects.       Excursions and activities may include:     Counter Intelligence Service of the Czech Republic (BIS)    Ministry of Foreign Affairs    Ministry of the Interior    Institute of International Relations, Prague Security Studies Institute, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty     Walking tour of historical Prague and Prague Castle    Two special dinners with faculty (welcome and farewell dinner)          Site    The program will be conducted at the University\u2019s Global Programs site NYU in Prague . The NYU Center is situated at Male Namesti in two 15th-century buildings only steps away from the Old Town Square and Prague's historic clock tower. One of the buildings, originally called the &quot;White Lion,&quot; once housed one of the earliest print shops in Central Europe, where the Czech Bible was printed. NYU facilities are ideally located to take advantage of the present day political excitement and historical imagery of the city.\u00a0    Accommodations    Program participants will be accommodated in single at a centrally located hotel in Prague\u2019s Old Town (Prague 1) within immediate walking distance of historic Old Town Square, the academic center at Male Namesti, and Vaclavske Namesti/Wenceslas Square.       Faculty    MARK GALEOTTI, CLINICAL PROFESSOR   Dr. Mark Galeotti is a specialist in transnational organized crime, security affairs and modern Russia. He started his academic career concentrating on conventional security issues, including the impact of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the implications of the disintegration of the USSR. However, in his fieldwork he encountered the rising new generation of gangsters carving out their portions of the decaying Soviet Union and was one of the first Western academics to recognize this as an emerging security concern. Since then, he has become increasingly interested in the transnationalisation of not just Russian but all forms of organized crime and their impact on the international order and development as a shadowy opposite to the global citizenship at the heart of the CGA\u2019s mission.

The twentieth century was marked by the incursions of foreign powers, from Nazi Germany to the USSR, and the imposition after 1945 of Soviet domination. The experience of the Czech Republic has been especially dramatic, from the 1989 \u2018velvet revolution\u2019 which bloodlessly toppled Communist Party rule, through the 1993 division of Czechoslovakia into two new countries -- the Czech Republic and Slovakia -- and the subsequent recreation of a liberal, democratic and free market state.   \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   This Global Field Intensive course will use the Czech experience to explore how and when countries are able to recreate themselves and what determines how successful such changes can be.

The experience of the Czech Republic has been especially dramatic, and now as relations between Russia and the West worsen, it again finds itself on the frontline of continent-spanning political, economic and ideological rivalries.    This Global Field Intensive course will use the Czech experience to explore this new security challenge -- is it, as some argue, a new cold war? -- and more generally the many ways in which countries' efforts to recreate themselves generate and are hindered by security challenges. To this end, it will consider 'security' very broadly. How far, for example, were the Central European transitions influenced by fears of Russian imperialism and interference? Are these new states able to address crucial human and economic security challenges, from transnational crime and people trafficking to the influx of dirty money and a dependence on Russian energy supplies? What is the importance of bodies such as NATO to them, and how can small, relatively poor countries develop their own intelligence structures?    Using the NYU Prague Center as a base, students will engage with policy makers, journalists, diplomats, academics, NGO staff and the rich history of Prague and the Czech Republic, in both formal meetings and personal field research on their own projects.       Excursions and activities may include:     Counter Intelligence Service of the Czech Republic (BIS)    Ministry of Foreign Affairs    Ministry of the Interior    Institute of International Relations, Prague Security Studies Institute, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty     Walking tour of historical Prague and Prague Castle    Two special dinners with faculty (welcome and farewell dinner)          Site    The program will be conducted at the University\u2019s Global Programs site NYU in Prague . The NYU Center is situated at Male Namesti in two 15th-century buildings only steps away from the Old Town Square and Prague's historic clock tower. One of the buildings, originally called the &quot;White Lion,&quot; once housed one of the earliest print shops in Central Europe, where the Czech Bible was printed. NYU facilities are ideally located to take advantage of the present day political excitement and historical imagery of the city.\u00a0    Accommodations    Program participants will be accommodated in single at a centrally located hotel in Prague\u2019s Old Town (Prague 1) within immediate walking distance of historic Old Town Square, the academic center at Male Namesti, and Vaclavske Namesti/Wenceslas Square.
