Since 2006, the NYU Reynolds Program has awarded over 60 Graduate Fellowships in Social      Entrepreneurship to students from across 11 NYU schools. The fellowship program includes      $25,000 for each of two years of study and an intensive two-year curricular and co-curricular      program designed to help prepare fellows to be the next generation of social entrepreneurs.                    Broadly speaking, the program attracts three types of changemakers:            those that have or are planning to develop an innovative idea to address a specific       social problem in a pattern breaking, sustainable and scalable way;       those that will work in and/or build the infrastructure needed for social entrepreneurial       work to take root, including individuals who will practice their profession in a social       entrepreneurial organization (accountants, lawyers, etc.) and individuals who want to       improve the operations and management systems of public, private and not for profit       organizations; and       those who will bring action oriented awareness on a national and/or global scale to       particular social problems through journalism, the arts, photography, film making,       television production and other media avenues.              These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and one individual can play multiple      roles. Further, each role can be thought of having its own trajectory beginning with the      desire to change the world, and ending with the implementation of a pattern breaking,      sustainable and scalable idea or approach. Fellows can be at different points on these      trajectories with some working to more fully develop an idea, while others may be ready to      launch an idea, while still others may be ready to bring an already launched idea more fully      to scale.                    Regardless of the developmental stage of the idea or where a changemaker is on their social      entrepreneurial trajectory, Reynolds fellows are academically accomplished individuals from a      wide variety of disciplines who have a demonstrable heritage of concern for issues of social      importance, have distinguished themselves as a potential changemaker, and are committed to      continuing to dedicate themselves to addressing issues of social importance in pattern      breaking, sustainable and scalable ways.              Graduate Fellows take part in a full range of programming and opportunities including:                                The \"Social Entrepreneurship in the 21st Century\" Speaker Series: A city-wide       speaker series bringing six influential leaders from various fields to NYU each year.
