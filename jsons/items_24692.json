Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience.

How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Click here to schedule a diagnositc evaluation at the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment.     For individuals experiencing memory problems, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is the first step toward determining the nature and significance of the problems, and getting the right care. Memory problems can result from many different medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, or they can be a result of normal aging (age-related cognitive decline). A diagnostic evaluation is the only way health care providers can assess a person's condition and provide an accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis then determines appropriate treatment and care options, as well as an accurate forecast of the course of the problem (what doctors call \"a prognosis\").     A diagnostic evaluation can also provide reassurance for aging individuals who are not currently experiencing symptoms, but are concerned about possible memory decline in the future. For these individuals, a diagnostic evaluation provides a basis for comparison with future assessments.     What does a diagnostic evaluation include?     There is no single test that can provide all the information needed to make an accurate diagnosis for memory problems. A diagnostic evaluation, therefore, has many different potential components. It consists of a careful and detailed history of a person's current symptoms (onset and progression), his or her medical history, any current medications that may effect cognition, and a series of tests to assess various aspects of the current mental status. Several medical and neurological tests are also performed to help with the diagnosis by excluding conditions that may be causing or aggravating cognitive impairment.      A diagnostic evaluation generally includes the following components:      Psychometric testing. Psychometric tests objectively measure cognitive performance the accuracy, speed, and quality of various aspects of mental processes. These include tests to assess functions such as immediate and delayed memory, attention, language, executive function, and problem solving.      Neurological examination. A neurological examination assesses language, gait (how a person walks), coordination, reflexes, and sensory perception as they are affected by changes in brain function.      A physical examination. A complete physical examination is performed and includes an electrocardiogram and blood and urine tests. These tests determine the presence or absence of conditions that may cause or aggravate memory deficits. Such conditions include thyroid conditions, vitamin 812 deficiency, electrolyte imbalances, high blood pressure, and heart arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances).      A psychiatric evaluation.This part of the diagnostic evaluation involves assessments that focuson cognition (memory, concentration, and orientation) and how itaffects a person's ability to function in daily activities. It alsoincludes assessments focused on behavior and mood, which may causememory problems, as well as information about the person's past medicaland psychiatric history.      An MRI or CT scan. An MRI or CT scan provides an image of the brain that helps in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or age-related cognitive decline by ruling out such conditions as stroke, brain tumor, or hydrocephalus, all of which can cause cognitive impairment.\u00a0     Once all the tests have been completed, and all laboratory results have been received, the information is reviewed and a diagnostic conclusion is reached.     Care and Treatment after the Diagnosis     A person who is experiencing age-related memory decline may notice a change in the condition over time. A person with dementia will experience changes in cognitive and functional abilities as the disease progresses. To ensure that Centers of Excellence patients understand the change in their status over time the Center suggests diagnostic evaluations and follow-up assessments regularly, as well as ongoing telephone consultation as needed.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Click here to schedule a diagnositc evaluation at the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment.     For individuals experiencing memory problems, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is the first step toward determining the nature and significance of the problems, and getting the right care. Memory problems can result from many different medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, or they can be a result of normal aging (age-related cognitive decline). A diagnostic evaluation is the only way health care providers can assess a person's condition and provide an accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis then determines appropriate treatment and care options, as well as an accurate forecast of the course of the problem (what doctors call \"a prognosis\").     A diagnostic evaluation can also provide reassurance for aging individuals who are not currently experiencing symptoms, but are concerned about possible memory decline in the future. For these individuals, a diagnostic evaluation provides a basis for comparison with future assessments.     What does a diagnostic evaluation include?     There is no single test that can provide all the information needed to make an accurate diagnosis for memory problems. A diagnostic evaluation, therefore, has many different potential components. It consists of a careful and detailed history of a person's current symptoms (onset and progression), his or her medical history, any current medications that may effect cognition, and a series of tests to assess various aspects of the current mental status. Several medical and neurological tests are also performed to help with the diagnosis by excluding conditions that may be causing or aggravating cognitive impairment.      A diagnostic evaluation generally includes the following components:      Psychometric testing. Psychometric tests objectively measure cognitive performance the accuracy, speed, and quality of various aspects of mental processes. These include tests to assess functions such as immediate and delayed memory, attention, language, executive function, and problem solving.      Neurological examination. A neurological examination assesses language, gait (how a person walks), coordination, reflexes, and sensory perception as they are affected by changes in brain function.      A physical examination. A complete physical examination is performed and includes an electrocardiogram and blood and urine tests. These tests determine the presence or absence of conditions that may cause or aggravate memory deficits. Such conditions include thyroid conditions, vitamin 812 deficiency, electrolyte imbalances, high blood pressure, and heart arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances).      A psychiatric evaluation.This part of the diagnostic evaluation involves assessments that focuson cognition (memory, concentration, and orientation) and how itaffects a person's ability to function in daily activities. It alsoincludes assessments focused on behavior and mood, which may causememory problems, as well as information about the person's past medicaland psychiatric history.      An MRI or CT scan. An MRI or CT scan provides an image of the brain that helps in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or age-related cognitive decline by ruling out such conditions as stroke, brain tumor, or hydrocephalus, all of which can cause cognitive impairment.\u00a0     Once all the tests have been completed, and all laboratory results have been received, the information is reviewed and a diagnostic conclusion is reached.     Care and Treatment after the Diagnosis     A person who is experiencing age-related memory decline may notice a change in the condition over time. A person with dementia will experience changes in cognitive and functional abilities as the disease progresses. To ensure that Centers of Excellence patients understand the change in their status over time the Center suggests diagnostic evaluations and follow-up assessments regularly, as well as ongoing telephone consultation as needed.

While biomarkers have been developed to detect AD-related brain pathology, these methods are either invasive, expensive or both. Our study focuses on developing novel cognitive tasks to detect brain impairment in the earliest stages of AD, even when there are no apparent symptoms. These tasks will provide a non-invasive and costeffective way to identify and track change in clinically normal individuals at high risk for progressing to the MCI and dementia stages of AD. We are enrolling subjects over age 45, who either: 1) are normal (with or without memory complaints) 2) have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or 3) have mild AD.

We are enrolling mild AD, MCI and normal subjects over age 20, who receive a comprehensive evaluation: neurological/physical exam, MRI and PET, memory testing, laboratory blood-work, EKG and lumbar puncture. Participants receive results and are compensated for their time and effort. \u00a0 For information, contact John Murray at 212-263-7795; john.murray@nyumc.org \u00a0   Imaging Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease with [11C] Arachidonic Acid (AA) and PET  The goal is to validate a new inflammation PET imaging agent known as [11C] Arachidonic Acid (AA) in individuals with and without cognitive dysfunction. Inflammation is a key component of the pathological processes (amyloid beta plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, astrocytosis) that are found in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). An in vivo neuroimaging method to measure markers of neuroinflammation would represent a major advance in the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and other dementing disorders. We are enrolling normal and dementia subjects over the age of 65 who will receive physical examinations, blood tests, neuropsychological evaluation, EKG, MRI; [11C]PIB, [18F]FDG, and [11C]AA PET scans. Participants are compensated for their time and effort.

Additional tests include brain structure measurement and CSF tau levels. Participants should have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and will receive a comprehensive evaluation consisting of a neurological/physical examination, neuroimaging (MRI and ASL), memory testing, laboratory blood-work, ECG and lumbar puncture. Participants receive results and are compensated for their time and effort. \u00a0 For information, contact Nicole Spector at 212-263-7563; Nicole.spector@nyumc.org \u00a0   Biomarkers in Early Alzheimer\u2019s Disease  This project builds upon on our new work, demonstrating the value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers. We combined these analyses with novel MRI technology which looks at cerebral blood flow, a possible mechanism-based marker for early Alzheimer's disease. \u00a0We are enrolling normal subjects over the age of age 50, with and without mild memory complaints, to receive a comprehensive evaluation: neurological/physical exam, MRI and memory testing, laboratory blood-work, EKG and lumbar puncture. Participants are compensated for their time and effort. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For information, contact Nicole Spector at 212-263-7563; Nicole.spector@nyumc.org   Are sleep disturbances a risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\u00a0  Sleep is a complex behavioral state involved in brain restoration, body rhythms, and memory consolidation. The term sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is commonly used to describe the full range of breathing problems during sleep in which not enough air reaches the lungs (hypopnea and apnea). Advancing age is accompanied by physiological changes in respiratory functions during sleep, resulting in a prevalence of SDB of 30-80% in individuals aged \u226560 years, compared to less than 10% in people aged 40. In the elderly, SDB is for the most part asymptomatic and less dependent to obesity, snoring, and sleepiness than SDB at a younger age. No study has addressed appropriately the neurological impact of SDB in the elderly. Our plan is to use home-based monitoring of SDB to identify a sample of normal elderly subjects with SDB. All subjects will receive plasma measures of inflammation, clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging (PIB and MRI) studies. Some participants will be invited to perform an in-lab sleep study (at the hospital). This novel study will provide additional evidence for the link between sleep respiratory changes in the elderly and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Given the high prevalence of both SDB and AD, identifying a potential mechanistic association would be of the highest relevance in establishing new pathways for AD treatment. For information, contact Ricardo Osorio at 212-263-3258; ricardo.osorio@nyumc.org   Blood pressure, cerebral perfusion and cognitive performance in hypertension  Hypertension (a chronically high blood pressure) may lead to impaired blood delivery to the brain, and consequently can cause brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. NYU Center for Brain Health invites adults age 65-80, with or without hypertension (treated with only one anti-hypertensive medication), to participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of one\u2019s current blood pressure on their brain, memory and thinking in the future. Your visit includes clinical medical exams, neuropsychological exams, blood work, ECG, carotid ultrasound, brain MRI, and 24 \u2013hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Click here to schedule a diagnositc evaluation at the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment.     For individuals experiencing memory problems, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is the first step toward determining the nature and significance of the problems, and getting the right care. Memory problems can result from many different medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, or they can be a result of normal aging (age-related cognitive decline). A diagnostic evaluation is the only way health care providers can assess a person's condition and provide an accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis then determines appropriate treatment and care options, as well as an accurate forecast of the course of the problem (what doctors call \"a prognosis\").     A diagnostic evaluation can also provide reassurance for aging individuals who are not currently experiencing symptoms, but are concerned about possible memory decline in the future. For these individuals, a diagnostic evaluation provides a basis for comparison with future assessments.     What does a diagnostic evaluation include?     There is no single test that can provide all the information needed to make an accurate diagnosis for memory problems. A diagnostic evaluation, therefore, has many different potential components. It consists of a careful and detailed history of a person's current symptoms (onset and progression), his or her medical history, any current medications that may effect cognition, and a series of tests to assess various aspects of the current mental status. Several medical and neurological tests are also performed to help with the diagnosis by excluding conditions that may be causing or aggravating cognitive impairment.      A diagnostic evaluation generally includes the following components:      Psychometric testing. Psychometric tests objectively measure cognitive performance the accuracy, speed, and quality of various aspects of mental processes. These include tests to assess functions such as immediate and delayed memory, attention, language, executive function, and problem solving.      Neurological examination. A neurological examination assesses language, gait (how a person walks), coordination, reflexes, and sensory perception as they are affected by changes in brain function.      A physical examination. A complete physical examination is performed and includes an electrocardiogram and blood and urine tests. These tests determine the presence or absence of conditions that may cause or aggravate memory deficits. Such conditions include thyroid conditions, vitamin 812 deficiency, electrolyte imbalances, high blood pressure, and heart arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances).      A psychiatric evaluation.This part of the diagnostic evaluation involves assessments that focuson cognition (memory, concentration, and orientation) and how itaffects a person's ability to function in daily activities. It alsoincludes assessments focused on behavior and mood, which may causememory problems, as well as information about the person's past medicaland psychiatric history.      An MRI or CT scan. An MRI or CT scan provides an image of the brain that helps in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or age-related cognitive decline by ruling out such conditions as stroke, brain tumor, or hydrocephalus, all of which can cause cognitive impairment.\u00a0     Once all the tests have been completed, and all laboratory results have been received, the information is reviewed and a diagnostic conclusion is reached.     Care and Treatment after the Diagnosis     A person who is experiencing age-related memory decline may notice a change in the condition over time. A person with dementia will experience changes in cognitive and functional abilities as the disease progresses. To ensure that Centers of Excellence patients understand the change in their status over time the Center suggests diagnostic evaluations and follow-up assessments regularly, as well as ongoing telephone consultation as needed.

Research is central in our graduate training. Students are exposed to a broad range of knowledge in cognition and perception and they are trained to think creatively and to develop independent research careers.                   Our program spans cognition and perception, examining mental processes such as perception, attention, memory, categorization, language, emotion, development, motor control, and cognitive neuroscience. How do we identify the letter &quot;a&quot;? How do we perceive depth and shape? What representational resources are innate? How do human cultures, and individual children, go beyond innate representational capacities? How do toddlers make decisions about their world? How are explicit and implicit memories coded in the brain? How do we inhibit inappropriate responses? How are sentences understood? How are new concepts acquired? How does attention affect perception?                   Students and faculty work closely with researchers in other departments ( Neural Science , Computer Science , Linguistics , and Philosophy ). Every week there are journal club discussions and talks by leading researchers that take place within the Psychology Department, in other NYU departments, and at other nearby schools in New York City (see Events ). Ready access to researchers at several great universities and to incredible cultural resources makes New York City a great place to study perception and cognition.                  Our graduate students begin research immediately. Students benefit from interaction with their faculty advisers and the lively exchange of research ideas among students, postdocs, and faculty at weekly Cognition and Perception colloquia and brown bag talks , research seminars, journal clubs ( cognitive neuroscience , development , ... see Events ) and our annual miniconvention. As a result of this focus on research, our students publish regularly in high-impact journals and go on to become researchers at the best research universities and industrial laboratories.                               Curriculum             What follows is a brief version of our curriculum. Full details may be found in our Graduate Student Guide . Our curriculum is designed to help students master the skills required to accomplish high quality research. Within the first two years, most students have completed the bulk of our primary course requirements. We require all students to take at least four courses in core, content-based areas of the discipline such as Memory, Perception, Attention, Cognitive Development, Psycholinguistics and Cognitive Neuroscience. In addition, we require all students to take at least two courses in quantitative methods, which can be the two-semester departmental statistics sequence, or other courses in probability theory, simulation, advanced statistical methods, etc. In addition, there are advanced seminars in areas related to the research areas of the faculty and students. The course catalog and schedule are online.                  A key aspect of our program is its strength in cognitive neuroscience, which students can select as their &quot;concentration&quot;. One aspect of this is the new, on-site, research-dedicated Center for Brain Imaging that includes a 3T MRI scanner and EEG facility, and will soon include a TMS facility as well. The center is designed to allow students the training and opportunity to become experts in cognitive neuroscience. Through a combination of course work and hands-on experience, students who select this concentration will receive training in the techniques of cognitive neuroscience and will apply these techniques to their chosen research questions.                   Students join a laboratory and begin to design and carry out a research project in their first semester. They are required to write a paper based on research they have performed as well as give a talk in our annual miniconvention at the end of their first and second years. The 2nd-year paper and completion of our basic course requirements generally result in the awarding of an MA degree. We encourage students to collaborate with more than one faculty member, including doing a full laboratory rotation or two. Students may work with primary Cognition &amp; Perception faculty or with affiliates from other programs (e.g., Social Psychology) or departments (e.g., the Center for Neural Science). (See faculty listed alphabetically with a sentence about their research interests, or by area .) In their third and fourth years, PhD students are focused primarily on research.                  We consider the best experience that students can have to become productive researchers is to carry out, write up, and present their research projects. The 1st- and 2nd-year research requirements emphasize this goal. The content and methods courses are designed to provide students with the context and tools they need to produce world-class research on their own. After graduating, most of our students have gone on to research careers. (See Recent PhDs .)                                                 Support             All students accepted into our graduate program are fully funded through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. MacCracken funding is provided through a combination of teaching assistantship, research assistantship, and fellowship, in proportions to be determined. The award package typically includes a full tuition scholarship, comprehensive health insurance and a stipend. Funding is typically guaranteed for five years, although students with substantial graduate credits or a Master's degree may only be guaranteed four years of support. For current information on the Psychology Department's aid package, please see our doctoral financial aid page .                         There is a very limited supply of subsidized housing available for graduate students which is generally used for a subset of each entering class to provide them the opportunity to get settled in New York City during their first year of residence.                               Admissions             To apply for admission to the Graduate Program in Cognition &amp; Perception, you'll need the application form , which is available from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Apply for admission to the Department of Psychology. In the forms there is a place where you specify the particular program in which you are interested (e.g. Cognition &amp; Perception), as well as whether you are also interested in the Developmental Concentration.                 In the application, it is requested that you supply a personal statement. You are free to include any information in that statement that you feel will help us in our admissions decision. However, as we are a research-based program, it is especially useful if you include a review of any research experience you have had (explain what was interesting about it) as well as your current research interests.                  Together with your application, the Graduate School of Arts and Science will require you to upload official transcripts of grades from other schools you have attended, both undergraduate and graduate. In addition, it is required that you take the Graduate Record Exam ( GRE ). Some of our students also submit scores from the Advanced Psychology GRE test. We place very little weight on that score, and do not encourage you to take it.      Please do NOT mail any documents (transcripts etc) to the department. Everything needs to be uploaded and submitted through the online application.             International applicants must take the TOEFL exams if English is not their first language unless they earned a Bachelor's or Master's degree at an English speaking university. Additional information of concern to international applicants is available online from the Office of Global Services .                 We recommend that you submit your application so as to arrive by December 12th.

Click here to schedule a diagnositc evaluation at the Pearl I. Barlow Center for Memory Evaluation and Treatment.     For individuals experiencing memory problems, a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is the first step toward determining the nature and significance of the problems, and getting the right care. Memory problems can result from many different medical conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment, or they can be a result of normal aging (age-related cognitive decline). A diagnostic evaluation is the only way health care providers can assess a person's condition and provide an accurate diagnosis. The diagnosis then determines appropriate treatment and care options, as well as an accurate forecast of the course of the problem (what doctors call \"a prognosis\").     A diagnostic evaluation can also provide reassurance for aging individuals who are not currently experiencing symptoms, but are concerned about possible memory decline in the future. For these individuals, a diagnostic evaluation provides a basis for comparison with future assessments.     What does a diagnostic evaluation include?     There is no single test that can provide all the information needed to make an accurate diagnosis for memory problems. A diagnostic evaluation, therefore, has many different potential components. It consists of a careful and detailed history of a person's current symptoms (onset and progression), his or her medical history, any current medications that may effect cognition, and a series of tests to assess various aspects of the current mental status. Several medical and neurological tests are also performed to help with the diagnosis by excluding conditions that may be causing or aggravating cognitive impairment.      A diagnostic evaluation generally includes the following components:      Psychometric testing. Psychometric tests objectively measure cognitive performance the accuracy, speed, and quality of various aspects of mental processes. These include tests to assess functions such as immediate and delayed memory, attention, language, executive function, and problem solving.      Neurological examination. A neurological examination assesses language, gait (how a person walks), coordination, reflexes, and sensory perception as they are affected by changes in brain function.      A physical examination. A complete physical examination is performed and includes an electrocardiogram and blood and urine tests. These tests determine the presence or absence of conditions that may cause or aggravate memory deficits. Such conditions include thyroid conditions, vitamin 812 deficiency, electrolyte imbalances, high blood pressure, and heart arrhythmia (rhythm disturbances).      A psychiatric evaluation.This part of the diagnostic evaluation involves assessments that focuson cognition (memory, concentration, and orientation) and how itaffects a person's ability to function in daily activities. It alsoincludes assessments focused on behavior and mood, which may causememory problems, as well as information about the person's past medicaland psychiatric history.      An MRI or CT scan. An MRI or CT scan provides an image of the brain that helps in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, or age-related cognitive decline by ruling out such conditions as stroke, brain tumor, or hydrocephalus, all of which can cause cognitive impairment.\u00a0     Once all the tests have been completed, and all laboratory results have been received, the information is reviewed and a diagnostic conclusion is reached.     Care and Treatment after the Diagnosis     A person who is experiencing age-related memory decline may notice a change in the condition over time. A person with dementia will experience changes in cognitive and functional abilities as the disease progresses.

While biomarkers have been developed to detect AD-related brain pathology, these methods are either invasive, expensive or both. Our study focuses on developing novel cognitive tasks to detect brain impairment in the earliest stages of AD, even when there are no apparent symptoms. These tasks will provide a non-invasive and costeffective way to identify and track change in clinically normal individuals at high risk for progressing to the MCI and dementia stages of AD. We are enrolling subjects over age 45, who either: 1) are normal (with or without memory complaints) 2) have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or 3) have mild AD.

Bioanatomical Phenotype of Parkinson\u2019s Disease With and Without Cognitive Impairment  The purpose of this study is to understand methods to best detect and characterize memory impairment in older adults with Parkinson\u2019s disease and understand the changes in the brain that cause memory problems. Older adults aged 60 or above with and without memory complaints will be recruited to receive a detailed clinical evaluation, pencil and paper testing of memory and thinking abilities, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study of the brain and an electroencephalogram (EEG) to study brain activity.

We are enrolling mild AD, MCI and normal subjects over age 20, who receive a comprehensive evaluation: neurological/physical exam, MRI and PET, memory testing, laboratory blood-work, EKG and lumbar puncture. Participants receive results and are compensated for their time and effort. \u00a0 For information, contact John Murray at 212-263-7795; john.murray@nyumc.org \u00a0   Imaging Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease with [11C] Arachidonic Acid (AA) and PET  The goal is to validate a new inflammation PET imaging agent known as [11C] Arachidonic Acid (AA) in individuals with and without cognitive dysfunction. Inflammation is a key component of the pathological processes (amyloid beta plaque deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal loss, astrocytosis) that are found in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). An in vivo neuroimaging method to measure markers of neuroinflammation would represent a major advance in the understanding of the pathophysiology of AD and other dementing disorders. We are enrolling normal and dementia subjects over the age of 65 who will receive physical examinations, blood tests, neuropsychological evaluation, EKG, MRI; [11C]PIB, [18F]FDG, and [11C]AA PET scans. Participants are compensated for their time and effort.

Additional tests include brain structure measurement and CSF tau levels. Participants should have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and will receive a comprehensive evaluation consisting of a neurological/physical examination, neuroimaging (MRI and ASL), memory testing, laboratory blood-work, ECG and lumbar puncture. Participants receive results and are compensated for their time and effort. \u00a0 For information, contact Nicole Spector at 212-263-7563; Nicole.spector@nyumc.org \u00a0   Biomarkers in Early Alzheimer\u2019s Disease  This project builds upon on our new work, demonstrating the value of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood biomarkers. We combined these analyses with novel MRI technology which looks at cerebral blood flow, a possible mechanism-based marker for early Alzheimer's disease. \u00a0We are enrolling normal subjects over the age of age 50, with and without mild memory complaints, to receive a comprehensive evaluation: neurological/physical exam, MRI and memory testing, laboratory blood-work, EKG and lumbar puncture. Participants are compensated for their time and effort. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 For information, contact Nicole Spector at 212-263-7563; Nicole.spector@nyumc.org   Are sleep disturbances a risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease?\u00a0  Sleep is a complex behavioral state involved in brain restoration, body rhythms, and memory consolidation. The term sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is commonly used to describe the full range of breathing problems during sleep in which not enough air reaches the lungs (hypopnea and apnea). Advancing age is accompanied by physiological changes in respiratory functions during sleep, resulting in a prevalence of SDB of 30-80% in individuals aged \u226560 years, compared to less than 10% in people aged 40. In the elderly, SDB is for the most part asymptomatic and less dependent to obesity, snoring, and sleepiness than SDB at a younger age. No study has addressed appropriately the neurological impact of SDB in the elderly. Our plan is to use home-based monitoring of SDB to identify a sample of normal elderly subjects with SDB. All subjects will receive plasma measures of inflammation, clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging (PIB and MRI) studies. Some participants will be invited to perform an in-lab sleep study (at the hospital). This novel study will provide additional evidence for the link between sleep respiratory changes in the elderly and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Given the high prevalence of both SDB and AD, identifying a potential mechanistic association would be of the highest relevance in establishing new pathways for AD treatment. For information, contact Ricardo Osorio at 212-263-3258; ricardo.osorio@nyumc.org   Blood pressure, cerebral perfusion and cognitive performance in hypertension  Hypertension (a chronically high blood pressure) may lead to impaired blood delivery to the brain, and consequently can cause brain shrinkage and cognitive decline. NYU Center for Brain Health invites adults age 65-80, with or without hypertension (treated with only one anti-hypertensive medication), to participate in a research study. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of one\u2019s current blood pressure on their brain, memory and thinking in the future. Your visit includes clinical medical exams, neuropsychological exams, blood work, ECG, carotid ultrasound, brain MRI, and 24 \u2013hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

This non-invasive method enables assessment of brain blood flow and vascular reserve.The study examines the effect of aging on hippocampal (memory center) perfusion assessed with arterial spin labeling MRI. This is a new imaging technique that uses magnetized water to image blood flow.Researchers seek to recruit volunteers between the ages of 55 and 90 who have a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Your participation will involve an MRI examination that takes 30 minutes. You will receive a $100 compensation for your participation.
