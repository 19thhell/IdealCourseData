The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.

The degree focuses on legal and financial translation as well as software localization. It is offered in English to Spanish , French to English and Spanish to English online, and in Chinese to English on-site, in New York City.   The program's rigorous curriculum prepares you to become an effective, professional translator by providing a foundation in translation and language theory, while addressing the practical aspects of translation as applied to the fields of business, finance, and law. You will learn to produce accurate, clear, and elegant texts in English. In addition, you will acquire the skills and the knowledge base needed to ensure textually and culturally accurate terminology in the preparation of business contracts, and books and articles on global commerce, trade, or the law. The program is taught by a faculty of accomplished translators and scholars who incorporate their applied professional experience into a curriculum that is rooted in translation theory and linguistic analysis.   Course offerings are organized into three groups: translation and language theory, legal and financial subject matter, and practical translation courses, with both required and elective courses in each group. While there are no required concentrations, the balance of required and elective courses allows you to focus more on legal or financial translation. The curriculum of the Chinese to English program reflects the needs of that specific market, covering a broader area of commercial translation and a course in technical translation. The final course is a capstone project, which can be either of a theoretical nature or a complex translation of significant length, which is defended in person at NYU or via video link in real time.   Students have the opportunity to expand the range of their skills and knowledge by auditing courses offered in our continuing education Certificates in Translation , enriching their portfolios by taking courses in areas of translation not offered in the master's program. All students, both online and on-site, benefit from the NYU Wasserman Center for Career Development at the NYU School of Professional Studies , where advisors work with them on job searches, interviewing skills, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 preparation, and other career-related areas.
