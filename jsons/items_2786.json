This trailblazing program will actively equip students \u2014 the next generation of leaders \u2014 with a deep and thorough understanding of how multifaith work and mindfulness can be incorporated into every aspect of their lives.   The Fellowship will involve two components: internship placements at partnering institutions and discussion-based learning sessions coordinated by Global Spiritual Life at NYU.          Meet the 2015 Fellows                                         Asad is a Junior studying at NYU's Silver School of Social Work, hoping to specifically study the intersection between social work &amp; social justice through connecting global issues with local ones. Asad is strongly motivated by his Muslim faith, and has founded a nonprofit organization called 'Muslims Giving Back,' which aims to empower needy families throughout the New York area by providing them with basic essentials they need to get them back on their feet. His favorite hobbies include reading, writing, and public speaking. Currently, Asad is working as a Conflict Resolution Intern at the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding and as a Social Work Intern at Make the Road New York.                                                 Kathie is a junior studying Childhood/Special Education with a minor in Global and Urban Education Studies. She is originally from Southern California and currently an RA at Greenwich Hotel as well as a member of Remnant Christian Fellowship here on campus. For the spring semester, she will also be interning at Awake Youth Project, working with Brooklyn youth to develop mindfulness practices in their everyday lives. She enjoys exploring the city, trying new cafes, and hopes to one day pursue a career teaching in a foreign country. You can find her obsessing over characters from Scandal, Grey's Anatomy, and Friends, while enjoying comfort food from her favorite cuisines.                                                 Madeline is a junior in Gallatin pursuing global visual culture with a minor in multi-faith leadership. She is interested in using visual arts to increase our understanding of others. As an intern for the Bronfman center, she assisted in the Jewish Learning Fellowship: Spiritual Practices for Real Life in which she was first introduced to mindful living. She has since sought out further mindfulness opportunities such as a meditative retreat while abroad in England at Bhaktivedanta Manor, donated by George Harrison to be a home for the International Hare Krishna Society. Last summer, she blogged for the Center for Spiritual Life about her experience in teaching mindfulness to her mom. She's thrilled to be working with the Auburn Theological Seminary, researching mindfulness and social justice.                                                 Jordan is an active member of Christian life on campus and is passionate about interfaith dialogue. One of her goals is to see meaningful cross faith friendships established and to help foster platforms for their formations at NYU. She majors in History and minors in Multifaith Leadership. Jordan also serves on leadership for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, is Treasurer for the Christian Inter-Fellowship Council, a member of the Multifaith Advisory Council, and is a co-founder and co-President of MuCh (Muslim-Christian Dialogue).                                                 Brian is currently a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, where he intends to major in Metropolitan Studies. He is originally from the sunny land of Los Angeles, where he attended Loyola High School, a Jesuit institution. It was here that he originally became involved in spiritual life through his work in the Campus Ministry program, where he assisted in planning events and led a retreat towards the end of his high school years. Though he does not subscribe himself to any particular religion or philosophy at this point in time, he hopes to use the experience he has to help promote interfaith cooperation and the practice of mindfulness through his work in NYU\u2019s Office of Global Spiritual Life.

Some miscellaneous pleasures of her\u2019s are dachshunds, carbohydrates, and black articles of clothing. She\u2019d tell you not to hesitate to approach her but by the time you\u2019ve read this, you have probably already exchanged our journeys on the pursuit of happiness.

This trailblazing program will actively equip students \u2014 the next generation of leaders \u2014 with a deep and thorough understanding of how multifaith work and mindfulness can be incorporated into every aspect of their lives.   The Fellowship will involve two components: internship placements at partnering institutions and discussion-based learning sessions coordinated by Global Spiritual Life at NYU.

Asad is strongly motivated by his Muslim faith, and has founded a nonprofit organization called 'Muslims Giving Back,' which aims to empower needy families throughout the New York area by providing them with basic essentials they need to get them back on their feet. His favorite hobbies include reading, writing, and public speaking. Currently, Asad is working as a Conflict Resolution Intern at the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding and as a Social Work Intern at Make the Road New York.                                                 Kathie is a junior studying Childhood/Special Education with a minor in Global and Urban Education Studies. She is originally from Southern California and currently an RA at Greenwich Hotel as well as a member of Remnant Christian Fellowship here on campus. For the spring semester, she will also be interning at Awake Youth Project, working with Brooklyn youth to develop mindfulness practices in their everyday lives. She enjoys exploring the city, trying new cafes, and hopes to one day pursue a career teaching in a foreign country. You can find her obsessing over characters from Scandal, Grey's Anatomy, and Friends, while enjoying comfort food from her favorite cuisines.                                                 Madeline is a junior in Gallatin pursuing global visual culture with a minor in multi-faith leadership. She is interested in using visual arts to increase our understanding of others. As an intern for the Bronfman center, she assisted in the Jewish Learning Fellowship: Spiritual Practices for Real Life in which she was first introduced to mindful living. She has since sought out further mindfulness opportunities such as a meditative retreat while abroad in England at Bhaktivedanta Manor, donated by George Harrison to be a home for the International Hare Krishna Society. Last summer, she blogged for the Center for Spiritual Life about her experience in teaching mindfulness to her mom. She's thrilled to be working with the Auburn Theological Seminary, researching mindfulness and social justice.                                                 Jordan is an active member of Christian life on campus and is passionate about interfaith dialogue. One of her goals is to see meaningful cross faith friendships established and to help foster platforms for their formations at NYU. She majors in History and minors in Multifaith Leadership. Jordan also serves on leadership for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, is Treasurer for the Christian Inter-Fellowship Council, a member of the Multifaith Advisory Council, and is a co-founder and co-President of MuCh (Muslim-Christian Dialogue).                                                 Brian is currently a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, where he intends to major in Metropolitan Studies. He is originally from the sunny land of Los Angeles, where he attended Loyola High School, a Jesuit institution. It was here that he originally became involved in spiritual life through his work in the Campus Ministry program, where he assisted in planning events and led a retreat towards the end of his high school years. Though he does not subscribe himself to any particular religion or philosophy at this point in time, he hopes to use the experience he has to help promote interfaith cooperation and the practice of mindfulness through his work in NYU\u2019s Office of Global Spiritual Life.                                                 Amanda is a sophomore in the Gallatin School of Individualized Study concentrating in &quot;how to live a good life in the three focuses of spirituality, mental health, and law through a philosophical lens.\u201d She maintains a regular mindfulness practice and when she\u2019s not eliciting universal truths with/from friends and strangers around New York City and beyond, she enjoys playing and listening to an eclectic array of music. Some miscellaneous pleasures of her\u2019s are dachshunds, carbohydrates, and black articles of clothing. She\u2019d tell you not to hesitate to approach her but by the time you\u2019ve read this, you have probably already exchanged our journeys on the pursuit of happiness. Ultimately, she believes that gratitude, kindness, and the acceptance that us as human beings will experience painful emotions, which will lead to a more fulfilling and spiritual life.
