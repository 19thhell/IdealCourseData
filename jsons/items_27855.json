Designing an independent study is an important part of the project, and together the student and instructor should discuss the aims and content of the study. The independent study proposal should include the study\u2019s title, theme, readings, work to be submitted, and syllabus. While plans for the independent study may be tentative at the time the proposal form is submitted, students should fill out the whole form and not leave parts blank or \u201cto be decided on later.\u201d The Gallatin Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies will not review incomplete forms from students. Projects often change but it is important to put the plan in writing at the beginning of the semester so that the student and professor have a clear understanding of the work involved.   As you begin to work on the Independent Study Proposal, please refer to the Student Checklist to ensure that you do not miss any important steps or deadlines.   Identifying an Appropriate Instructor   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     The Committee on Individualized Studies strongly urges students to locate NYU faculty to direct their independent study. In rare instances a student may seek to work with a professor at another institution. There is no guarantee that a non-NYU faculty member will be approved as an instructor of a Gallatin Independent Study. Students seeking to work with non-NYU faculty members must attach the professor\u2019s curriculum vitae (CV) with the proposal form for review by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.     Number of Credits and Meeting Hours   Generally, independent studies are two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. The number of credits also determine the meeting hours. While the days and times of the student\u2019s meetings with the instructor are \u201cto be arranged,\u201d instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). In arranging contact hours, instructors and students may choose to meet every week for one-half hour, every other week for one hour, or less frequently, if appropriate, as long as they meet for a minimum of seven hours over the course of the semester. Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours). As in any other course, the student should come prepared for these meetings by completing readings and written work on time.     Credit Limitations   While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with the University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students, therefore, may register for no more than 8 credits per term in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.     Title of the Independent Study   If a student chooses, the title of an independent study will appear on his/her official transcript. Please check the \u201cTitle On Transcript\u201d box to indicate this. It should be a useful, descriptive title that reflects the unifying theme and content of the study. It should not duplicate an existing NYU course. The words \u201cIndependent Study\u201d will appear before the title on the transcript: for example, \u201cIndependent Study (The Plays of Arthur Miller).\u201d The title is limited to 26 characters including spaces and punctuation.     Description of Study   Like the course description in a college catalog, this part of the proposal essay should describe the general theme and scope of the independent study. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The essay might indicate where the student is starting out and where s/he would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within 250 words.     Readings   The student must provide a reading list with authors and titles, even if tentative, along with the proposal. The list should be comparable to a similar classroom course list (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars often assign 6 \u2013 10 books, depending on length and complexity.) Readings may change during the semester as the study evolves, but the preliminary list should be appropriate for the number of credits, and should indicate the kind of works to be read. Proposals for creative projects should include readings, as well.     Work to be evaluated by the Instructor   The proposal should indicate the kinds of work (response papers, research essays, creative works, etc.) which will be evaluated by the instructor. Assignments should be comparable in extent to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars typically assign about 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester. Provide details about the work, including the number, length and type of work to be submitted (e.g., two research papers, one 10 pages and the other 15; a portfolio of 20 exhibit-quality photographs plus four reading response papers of 2 pages each). Ultimately, it is up to the student and instructor to determine the specific format of the work to be evaluated by the instructor. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.     Syllabus   The student must provide a schedule of meetings which includes the topics, the readings, and assignments to be covered during each session. Students can revise and adopt their syllabus with their instructor once the semester begins.     Approval Signatures   Both the instructor\u2019s and adviser\u2019s approval of the proposal are required. While the instructor may agree to supervise the student\u2019s work, the student\u2019s adviser determines whether it is appropriate for the student to undertake an independent study. After submitting the proposal form, the student should follow up with both their adviser and instructor to make sure their approvals have been sent to Gallatin\u2019s Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.   Once the independent study proposal has been submitted to and approved by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies, the chair/dean indicates final approval with their signature. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Proposal Submission and Deadlines   The completed independent study proposal consists of:       adviser\u2019s approval   instructor\u2019s approval   completed proposal form   description of the study   syllabus   booklist     Students must submit all of the above components by the appropriate semester deadlines .       Student Checklist     Students should follow the deadlines listed on the Student Checklist to ensure approval of their proposal.     Instructor Guidelines   Faculty who will be working with and grading a student's independent study should read the Instructor Guidelines .                      top of page                           Quick Links                 Student Checklist Individualized Projects Deadlines Independent Study Proposal Form Instructor Guidelines                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.     Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.   Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.   Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's faculty adviser or Gallatin class adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.   Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Identify an alternate course to take in case the proposal is not approved.         Policy for Undergraduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students therefore may register for no more than 8 credits per semester in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.   While independent study provides students with the opportunity to work one-on-one with an instructor, in general, long distance independent studies are not permitted.   Students enrolled in another NYU school are generally not permitted to apply for a Gallatin Independent Study. In rare instances a student from another NYU school might be able to take a Gallatin Independent Study with a Gallatin professor.

Designing an independent study is an important part of the project, and together the student and instructor should discuss the aims and content of the study. The independent study proposal should include the study\u2019s title, theme, readings, work to be submitted, and syllabus. While plans for the independent study may be tentative at the time the proposal form is submitted, students should fill out the whole form and not leave parts blank or \u201cto be decided on later.\u201d The Gallatin Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies will not review incomplete forms from students. Projects often change but it is important to put the plan in writing at the beginning of the semester so that the student and professor have a clear understanding of the work involved.   As you begin to work on the Independent Study Proposal, please refer to the Student Checklist to ensure that you do not miss any important steps or deadlines.   Identifying an Appropriate Instructor   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     The Committee on Individualized Studies strongly urges students to locate NYU faculty to direct their independent study. In rare instances a student may seek to work with a professor at another institution. There is no guarantee that a non-NYU faculty member will be approved as an instructor of a Gallatin Independent Study. Students seeking to work with non-NYU faculty members must attach the professor\u2019s curriculum vitae (CV) with the proposal form for review by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.     Number of Credits and Meeting Hours   Generally, independent studies are two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed and should be comparable to that of a Gallatin classroom course. The number of credits also determine the meeting hours. While the days and times of the student\u2019s meetings with the instructor are \u201cto be arranged,\u201d instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). In arranging contact hours, instructors and students may choose to meet every week for one-half hour, every other week for one hour, or less frequently, if appropriate, as long as they meet for a minimum of seven hours over the course of the semester. Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours). As in any other course, the student should come prepared for these meetings by completing readings and written work on time.     Credit Limitations   While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with the University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience. Undergraduate students, therefore, may register for no more than 8 credits per term in any combination of independent study and/or tutorial.     Title of the Independent Study   If a student chooses, the title of an independent study will appear on his/her official transcript. Please check the \u201cTitle On Transcript\u201d box to indicate this. It should be a useful, descriptive title that reflects the unifying theme and content of the study. It should not duplicate an existing NYU course. The words \u201cIndependent Study\u201d will appear before the title on the transcript: for example, \u201cIndependent Study (The Plays of Arthur Miller).\u201d The title is limited to 26 characters including spaces and punctuation.     Description of Study   Like the course description in a college catalog, this part of the proposal essay should describe the general theme and scope of the independent study. The theme may be stated as a problem to be investigated, an issue to be explored, or an argument to be defended. The essay might indicate where the student is starting out and where s/he would like to get in terms of answering a question, exploring a phenomenon, understanding a theory, building a skill or other goal. It should articulate the theme and strategy of the study as clearly as possible within 250 words.     Readings   The student must provide a reading list with authors and titles, even if tentative, along with the proposal. The list should be comparable to a similar classroom course list (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars often assign 6 \u2013 10 books, depending on length and complexity.) Readings may change during the semester as the study evolves, but the preliminary list should be appropriate for the number of credits, and should indicate the kind of works to be read. Proposals for creative projects should include readings, as well.     Work to be evaluated by the Instructor   The proposal should indicate the kinds of work (response papers, research essays, creative works, etc.) which will be evaluated by the instructor. Assignments should be comparable in extent to a similar classroom course (e.g., interdisciplinary seminars typically assign about 25 pages of writing over the course of the semester. Provide details about the work, including the number, length and type of work to be submitted (e.g., two research papers, one 10 pages and the other 15; a portfolio of 20 exhibit-quality photographs plus four reading response papers of 2 pages each). Ultimately, it is up to the student and instructor to determine the specific format of the work to be evaluated by the instructor. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.     Syllabus   The student must provide a schedule of meetings which includes the topics, the readings, and assignments to be covered during each session. Students can revise and adopt their syllabus with their instructor once the semester begins.     Approval Signatures   Both the instructor\u2019s and adviser\u2019s approval of the proposal are required. While the instructor may agree to supervise the student\u2019s work, the student\u2019s adviser determines whether it is appropriate for the student to undertake an independent study. After submitting the proposal form, the student should follow up with both their adviser and instructor to make sure their approvals have been sent to Gallatin\u2019s Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.   Once the independent study proposal has been submitted to and approved by the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies, the chair/dean indicates final approval with their signature. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Proposal Submission and Deadlines   The completed independent study proposal consists of:       adviser\u2019s approval   instructor\u2019s approval   completed proposal form   description of the study   syllabus   booklist     Students must submit all of the above components by the appropriate semester deadlines .

Often the idea for an independent study arises in a course; for example, in a seminar on early 20th-century American history, a student may develop an interest in the Harlem Renaissance and ask the instructor to supervise an independent study focused exclusively on this topic during the next semester. Students may also develop creative projects in areas such as, but not limited to, music composition, filmmaking, or fiction writing.     Below is an outline of the process that students follow to set up an independent study. Because the student and the instructor are designing a course, students must begin this process a full semester in advance. Students can refer to the Student Checklist to investigate the planning timeline for these steps:       Students should discuss with their faculty adviser the possibility of conducting an independent study.   Generate a basic idea: a problem or a question, a time period, a literary genre, a natural phenomenon, a philosophical theme, or a creative skill.   Identify an appropriate instructor: the student's faculty adviser or Gallatin class adviser; a member of the Gallatin faculty or other NYU faculty; and with special approval, a professor from another university or college. Contact the prospective instructor to propose the study and to discuss the plans for the work.   Complete and submit the Independent Study Proposal form for review and approval by Gallatin's Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies. Please note that submitting a proposal does not guarantee approval.   Identify an alternate course to take in case the proposal is not approved.         Policy for Undergraduate Students     Generally, the work for an independent study should be comparable to a Gallatin classroom course. The specific format of the work will be determined by the student and the instructor who will evaluate it. They may choose several short papers, or a longer paper written in sections as the work progresses and depending on the nature of the study, video productions, paintings or music productions may be appropriate. The work for the study should be submitted according to the schedule of due dates agreed upon at the outset, and as with a classroom course, late work may be penalized.   Independent studies may be taken for two, three or four credits. The number of credits is determined by the amount of work to be completed.     Instructors and students meet for a minimum number of hours per semester: for a 4-credit Independent Study, the minimum number of contact hours is seven (7). Contact hours for an Independent Study which is less than 4 credits should be prorated accordingly (e.g., a 2-credit independent study should meet for a minimum of 3.5 hours).   An instructor for a Gallatin Independent Study should be an NYU faculty member. In rare cases a professor from another university or college might be approved to instruct an Independent Study.     While students are encouraged to engage in independent work with University faculty, the Gallatin program is designed for a careful balance between independent and classroom experience.

Develop the description of the study, the syllabus and the reading list.      approximately two weeks prior to the proposal submission deadline :     Complete the Independent Study proposal form , which will be sent automatically to your adviser and grading instructor.   Within a few days of submission of the form, follow up with your adviser and instructor to make sure they have received the proposal.      approximately one week prior to the proposal submission deadline :     Confirm with your adviser and instructor that they have submitted their approval to Gallatin.   If you have not received confirmation from both your adviser and instructor that they have approved your proposal, contact Kathe Ann Joseph . Do not wait until the submission deadline to notify Gallatin of problems.      approximately two weeks after the proposal submission deadline :     Look for email correspondence regarding your proposal from Gallatin informing you of the decision of the Faculty Committee on Individualized Studies.      before classes begin:     If your proposal is approved, register for your independent study on Albert.   If your proposal is not approved, be prepared to take an alternate course.                          top of page                           Quick Links                 Independent Study Proposal Guidelines Individualized Projects Deadlines Independent Study Proposal Form                                                                                      NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.
