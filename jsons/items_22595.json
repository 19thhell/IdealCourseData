NYU School of Law and Concurrences Competition Law Journal Conference  Friday, October 24, 2014  8:00-6:30pm  40 Washington Square South, Greenberg Lounge   CONFERENCE REPORT   Abstract: Rapidly emerging economies such as China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa are taking center stage in antitrust enforcement. Multinational firms must have regard to the competition systems of these and other developing nations when engaging in merger activity, collaborating with competitors, and pricing, distributing, and licensing their products. Competition authorities in countries at different stages of development are trying to meet the daunting challenges posed by public and private power, cronyism and privilege, and are trying to make their markets work for the good of their peoples. This program will address the coming of age of developing countries\u2019 competition law systems, and what this means in law, policy and on-the-ground reality for entrepreneurs, consumers, \u201cthe people,\u201d and the world.
