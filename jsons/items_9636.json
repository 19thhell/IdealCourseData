To anyone who\u2019s been paying attention, it should be obvious that our country has undergone rapid, sweeping cultural change over the past 4 or 8 or 12 years regarding how we think about gay rights. Gallup poll data shows that 58% of Americans believe that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, up from 38% in 2002, and 54% now believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law, with same rights as traditional marriages, up from 37% in 2005. And a whopping 90% of Americans support protections from discrimination for gay and lesbian employees.   But what\u2019s driving the trend? And will it last?                             Patrick Egan         Divining the answers to those questions can be a little like reading tealeaves. So for some concrete, fact-based insights, NYU Stories turned to Patrick J. Egan , a stats-minded politics and public policy professor who\u2019s spent a lot of time studying fluctuations in public opinion. A leading researcher on what led voters to pass Proposition 8 in California, he\u2019s also the author of a book on issue ownership, or the tendency of voters to identify certain causes with certain political parties.   Egan dates the start of the move toward widely held liberal attitudes on gay rights to the 1970s\u2014but notes that the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s dampened what might otherwise have been a quicker progression. The pace of change picked up in the \u201990s (after antiviral therapies began to curtail the AIDS death toll, Egan points out), stalled briefly with a conservative backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (striking down all remaining state laws that criminalized gay sex) in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and accelerated rapidly in recent years, with an indisputable majority of Americans now even supporting adoption rights for gay people. \u201cIt\u2019s really been quite an amazing change,\u201d Egan says, \u201cand one whose swiftness we hardly ever see in aggregate public opinion trends in the U.S.\u201d   Two primary factors are driving the shift. One has to do with the overwhelming support of gay rights by members of the millennial generation, who are joining the electorate as older voters who hold more conservative views on the issue die off; experts like Egan call this effect \u201ccohort replacement.\u201d In other cases, Americans are simply changing their minds\u2014a phenomenon reflected in panel data collected from individuals surveyed repeatedly over time.   While we\u2019ll never know exactly what\u2019s swaying individual hearts and minds, the evidence suggests that some Americans\u2014particularly Democrats\u2014who\u2019ve moved in favor of gay rights over the past 10 years may have taken their cues from political leaders. \u201cIn political science,\u201d Egan explains, \u201cprobably the number one source of attitude change on any issue\u2014from taxes to the Iraq war\u2014is what elites say about it.\u201d And among the Democratic party elite, the shift has been dramatic: In the 2004 Democratic primary, Egan points out, the controversial question was which candidate would support civil unions for gay people; looking ahead to the 2016 race, all of the Democratic presidential candidates will support same-sex marriage. Of course, politicians adjust their positions to the whims of public opinion, too\u2014often leading, as in the months approaching President Obama\u2019s public endorsement of marriage equality , to a kind of game of \u201cchicken.\u201d   And these days, Republicans are also getting in on the act: Egan points to a \u201csmall but substantial group\u201d of leaders\u2014from former vice president Dick Cheney to Ohio Senator Rob Portman and Mary Bono, a former Congresswoman from California\u2014who are \u201cbreaking the party\u2019s Orthodoxy\u201d by speaking out in favor of gay rights. In February, Republican Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed business owners to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds. At the same time, Egan says, the party\u2014like the country at large\u2014is split along generational lines, with young Republicans beginning to embrace same-sex marriage. It\u2019s a rift, he predicts, that will eventually lead the party to abandon opposition to gay marriage as one of its signature issues.   If there\u2019s a precedent for all of this, it\u2019s the decades-long progression toward near universal acceptance of interracial marriage: In fact, the map of where interracial marriage was legal in 1951 is strikingly similar to the map of where same-sex marriage is legal today. \u201cThe parallel has a lot of intellectual force and also moral gravity,\u201d Egan says. \u201cAre you going to legally recognize these people who are willing to make a lifelong commitment to one another, or are you going to use the force of law to render that commitment null and void?\u201d   While it\u2019s inspiring to witness a growing number gay marriage bans going the way of anti-miscegenation laws, it\u2019s also curious that our political geography\u2014as represented in those near-identical maps\u2014has changed so little in more than 60 years. When asked why the states that opposed interracial marriage are the same ones where marriage equality struggles to gain traction today, Egan points to two demographic factors that make a difference when it comes to tolerance: religiosity and educational attainment. Over 60 years, most places haven\u2019t changed much on those variables: States where populations tend to support gay marriage (like they did interracial marriage) boast higher levels of educational attainment and lower levels of religiosity than those that oppose it.   And as for millennials? Compared to their parents, they\u2019re less invested in religion\u2014and in institutions of all kinds\u2014and they\u2019re the most highly educated generation in U.S. history. Add to that the fact that a growing number of religious institutions have shifted on gay rights issues\u2014even the Mormon Church has withdrawn its once generous financial support from groups opposing gay marriage\u2014and it would seem that we\u2019re about to reach some kind of tipping point.   That\u2019s not to suggest the going will be easy: \u201cIn socially conservative states like Alabama or Nebraska or Wyoming, it\u2019s going to take a very, very long time, if trends persist, to get majorities on gay marriage,\u201d Egan says. And then there\u2019s a question of a national standard that would allow married gay couples to be recognized in every state. Loving v. Virginia , the 1967 Supreme Court decision that invalidated legal prohibitions against interracial marriage, came at a time when most states had already abandoned their miscegenation laws. \u201cIt may be that a similar story will take place for gay marriage. Does the Supreme Court want to impose a 50-state standard now, or much later when gay-marriage bans are seen more as an anachronism?\u201d   Egan predicts that in 20 years, national law and policy on gay rights will resemble that of Massachusetts today: Same-sex marriage will likely be legal and recognized throughout the land, and there will be laws in place to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination in a variety of realms. And yet as any child of the civil rights era can attest, the culture often lags behind the law. Racial prejudice did not end with laws that prohibited discrimination, and segregation in housing and education persists, to some degree, even to this day. Likewise, Egan muses, if you \u201casked gay people in Massachusetts where they\u2019d feel comfortable holding their spouse\u2019s hand, they could probably identify only about 6 blocks within the whole state.\u201d   \u2014Eileen Reynolds   Follow Patrick Egan on Twitter .

But despite what we might remember from our school days, it turns out that the story of Spanish immigration doesn\u2019t stop at the colonial heyday of old Florida\u2019s St. Augustine.   Between 1880 and 1930, four million Spaniards arrived in the Americas\u2014more than the previous four centuries (1492-1880) combined, explains James Fern\u00e1ndez, an associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. But this fact would probably surprise the descendants of these immigrants, in part because their ties to the past are looser than those of other ethnic communities. Fern\u00e1ndez has found that Spanish-Americans living in, say, Donora, Pa., tend not to know of similar communities in places like Cherryvalle, Kan., or even Tampa, Fla.. Whereas the contributions of Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans are celebrated and mythologized in museums and parades galore, U.S. cities offer few cultural landmarks commemorating the Spanish-American experience.   But Fern\u00e1ndez is out to change that. Since 2010, he and his collaborator, the Spanish filmmaker and journalist Luis Argeo, have been traveling the country to conduct interviews and collect photographs and documents that tell the all-but-forgotten story of the scores of Spanish immigrants who settled\u2014and quickly assimilated\u2014in towns from Vermont to Hawaii during the first decades of the 20th century. The grandson of Spanish immigrants who met and married in New York City in the 1920s, Fern\u00e1ndez says he grew up believing that his grandparents\u2019 journey here was unique\u2014a perception that his interview subjects often share.   \u201cThis has become a lesson about how public memory is inscribed in private photo albums,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says of the archiving project, which he calls \u201c Ni Frailes ni Conquistadores (Neither Friars nor Conquistadors): Spanish Immigrants in the U.S., 1898-1936.\u201d As the 80- or 90-year-old daughters and sons of Spanish immigrants, Fernandez\u2019s sources are often able to put names to faces in family photos\u2014but don\u2019t always know the significance of pictures that were taken when they were still in diapers.   \u201cVery often the owners of these photo albums can\u2019t see beyond their private, intimate meaning\u2014but to someone with a historical perspective, they often contain valuable information,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. Among his own family\u2019s possessions, for example, Fern\u00e1ndez recently identified an unfamiliar man photographed with a group of his relatives as Jos\u00e9 Miaja, the Spanish Republican Army commander who led the defense of Madrid against siege by General Francisco Franco\u2019s troops during the Spanish Civil War.   For now, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s growing archive lives online , and with the students in his 2011 undergraduate seminar on Spain in New York he built a website marking historic Spanish sites at and around NYU\u2019s Greenwich Village campus, which overlaps the neighborhood once known as New Spain. He and Argeo have also built a Facebook page, called Spanish Immigrants in the United States , where they post four times a day, sharing documents, photographs, and newspaper clippings and soliciting the same from their growing following of more than 2,000. Photos they share of celebrities, like the glamorous Rita Hayworth, whose father emigrated from Spain, garner a predictable flurry of \u201clikes.\u201d And food? \u201cIt drives \u2019em crazy!\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cI can start a fight on Facebook over who makes the best chorizo, or where the best Christmas cookies come from.\u201d   But the social network has also proved a valuable scholarly tool: Fern\u00e1ndez and Argeo have planned trips to St. Louis, Mo., San Leandro, Ca., to meet with Spanish-Americans with whom they first connected through Facebook. Their main source in Cleveland, a former flight attendant who had been carefully preserving her Spanish grandparents\u2019 archive, also found their project through the page. No two family\u2019s histories are identical, of course, but part of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s charge is to stitch those apparently isolated stories into a broader narrative about an overlooked diaspora.   There were myriad reasons for leaving Spain in the first two decades of the 20th century: The Spanish economy was in shambles following the loss of its colonies in Cuba, the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War of 1898, and military conscription meant that young men could expect to die in similar bloody battles in Northern Africa as the former imperial power dwindled. Fleeing these conditions, many Spaniards moved first to Spanish-speaking Latin America, and then made their way from Mexico or Cuba to the United States. Others were recruited directly for work in specific industries, from sugarcane to canal digging to zinc mining.   \u201cAssimilation, for most of these folks, was incredibly fast and successful,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says\u2014which could be one reason few traces of Spanish identity remain in the communities where they settled. Another has to do with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Fernandez suspects that much Spanish settlement in the United States was somewhat accidental: Immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s with no intention of planting roots here decided not to return home only after Spain\u2019s democratic government was overthrown in Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist coup. His hypothesis is supported by a curious pattern he\u2019s noticed in family documents\u2014a glut of U.S. naturalization papers dated 1939, \u201940, and \u201941 for people who\u2019d been in the country since 1920 or earlier.   Complicating things further is the fact that those who opposed Franco and supported Spain\u2019s democratic loyalists ended up being targeted as communists during the McCarthy era\u2014leading some Spanish families to keep quiet about their roots. It\u2019s a practice analogous to German-Americans abandoning their own native celebrations and associations in the years following World War I. \u201cWe\u2019ve even found cases of families destroying or tearing the inscriptions off of photographs,&quot; Fernandez says. In that sense, he says, the stories that descendants of immigrants tend to misremember or even obscure are often as illuminating as the family memories they cherish.   For Fern\u00e1ndez, \u201cNi frailes ni conquistadores\u201d is also a journey of personal discovery: Though he\u2019s taught Spanish language and literature for years, it wasn\u2019t until recently that he contemplated the intersections between his academic interests and his family history. \u201cFor years I taught Federico Garcia Lorca, who came to New York in 1929 and wrote one of his major books of poems, Poeta in Nueva York, here,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez reflects. \u201cBut it never occurred to me that Lorca and abuelo [grandfather] inhabited the same sphere.\u201d   Reading Lorca\u2019s letters from New York back to his family in Spain, Fern\u00e1ndez found a mention of a lunch at a dive on the Hudson River that finally helped him to make the connection. \u201cLorca described the owner as an astute guy from Galicia who was selling bootleg liquor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been my grandfather serving that anise.\u201d   View the slideshow above to take Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s historic tour through hidden Spanish-American outposts in the U.S.   Top photo: Cleveland Spanish community picnic, June 1942, courtesy of Laura Goyanes. Employment opportunities in the heavy industries (steel, rubber, etc.) in and around Cleveland attracted large numbers of Spanish immigrants to the area in the 1910s and \u201920s, among them the Galician-born father of Oscar-winning actor Martin Sheen, who lived and worked in Dayton.       \u2014Eileen Reynolds                                                                                                                                                         NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

The U.S. Postal Service just issued a Harvey Milk stamp. Laverne Cox is on the cover of Time magazine. Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on national television when he was drafted into the NFL last month. The National Parks Service just launched an initiative to mark prominent places and events from LGBT American history.   To anyone who\u2019s been paying attention, it should be obvious that our country has undergone rapid, sweeping cultural change over the past 4 or 8 or 12 years regarding how we think about gay rights. Gallup poll data shows that 58% of Americans believe that gay and lesbian relations are morally acceptable, up from 38% in 2002, and 54% now believe that same-sex marriages should be recognized by the law, with same rights as traditional marriages, up from 37% in 2005. And a whopping 90% of Americans support protections from discrimination for gay and lesbian employees.   But what\u2019s driving the trend? And will it last?                             Patrick Egan         Divining the answers to those questions can be a little like reading tealeaves. So for some concrete, fact-based insights, NYU Stories turned to Patrick J. Egan , a stats-minded politics and public policy professor who\u2019s spent a lot of time studying fluctuations in public opinion. A leading researcher on what led voters to pass Proposition 8 in California, he\u2019s also the author of a book on issue ownership, or the tendency of voters to identify certain causes with certain political parties.   Egan dates the start of the move toward widely held liberal attitudes on gay rights to the 1970s\u2014but notes that the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s dampened what might otherwise have been a quicker progression. The pace of change picked up in the \u201990s (after antiviral therapies began to curtail the AIDS death toll, Egan points out), stalled briefly with a conservative backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision (striking down all remaining state laws that criminalized gay sex) in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003, and accelerated rapidly in recent years, with an indisputable majority of Americans now even supporting adoption rights for gay people. \u201cIt\u2019s really been quite an amazing change,\u201d Egan says, \u201cand one whose swiftness we hardly ever see in aggregate public opinion trends in the U.S.\u201d   Two primary factors are driving the shift. One has to do with the overwhelming support of gay rights by members of the millennial generation, who are joining the electorate as older voters who hold more conservative views on the issue die off; experts like Egan call this effect \u201ccohort replacement.\u201d In other cases, Americans are simply changing their minds\u2014a phenomenon reflected in panel data collected from individuals surveyed repeatedly over time.   While we\u2019ll never know exactly what\u2019s swaying individual hearts and minds, the evidence suggests that some Americans\u2014particularly Democrats\u2014who\u2019ve moved in favor of gay rights over the past 10 years may have taken their cues from political leaders. \u201cIn political science,\u201d Egan explains, \u201cprobably the number one source of attitude change on any issue\u2014from taxes to the Iraq war\u2014is what elites say about it.\u201d And among the Democratic party elite, the shift has been dramatic: In the 2004 Democratic primary, Egan points out, the controversial question was which candidate would support civil unions for gay people; looking ahead to the 2016 race, all of the Democratic presidential candidates will support same-sex marriage. Of course, politicians adjust their positions to the whims of public opinion, too\u2014often leading, as in the months approaching President Obama\u2019s public endorsement of marriage equality , to a kind of game of \u201cchicken.\u201d   And these days, Republicans are also getting in on the act: Egan points to a \u201csmall but substantial group\u201d of leaders\u2014from former vice president Dick Cheney to Ohio Senator Rob Portman and Mary Bono, a former Congresswoman from California\u2014who are \u201cbreaking the party\u2019s Orthodoxy\u201d by speaking out in favor of gay rights. In February, Republican Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed a bill that would have allowed business owners to refuse service to gays and lesbians on religious grounds. At the same time, Egan says, the party\u2014like the country at large\u2014is split along generational lines, with young Republicans beginning to embrace same-sex marriage. It\u2019s a rift, he predicts, that will eventually lead the party to abandon opposition to gay marriage as one of its signature issues.   If there\u2019s a precedent for all of this, it\u2019s the decades-long progression toward near universal acceptance of interracial marriage: In fact, the map of where interracial marriage was legal in 1951 is strikingly similar to the map of where same-sex marriage is legal today. \u201cThe parallel has a lot of intellectual force and also moral gravity,\u201d Egan says. \u201cAre you going to legally recognize these people who are willing to make a lifelong commitment to one another, or are you going to use the force of law to render that commitment null and void?\u201d   While it\u2019s inspiring to witness a growing number gay marriage bans going the way of anti-miscegenation laws, it\u2019s also curious that our political geography\u2014as represented in those near-identical maps\u2014has changed so little in more than 60 years. When asked why the states that opposed interracial marriage are the same ones where marriage equality struggles to gain traction today, Egan points to two demographic factors that make a difference when it comes to tolerance: religiosity and educational attainment. Over 60 years, most places haven\u2019t changed much on those variables: States where populations tend to support gay marriage (like they did interracial marriage) boast higher levels of educational attainment and lower levels of religiosity than those that oppose it.   And as for millennials? Compared to their parents, they\u2019re less invested in religion\u2014and in institutions of all kinds\u2014and they\u2019re the most highly educated generation in U.S. history. Add to that the fact that a growing number of religious institutions have shifted on gay rights issues\u2014even the Mormon Church has withdrawn its once generous financial support from groups opposing gay marriage\u2014and it would seem that we\u2019re about to reach some kind of tipping point.   That\u2019s not to suggest the going will be easy: \u201cIn socially conservative states like Alabama or Nebraska or Wyoming, it\u2019s going to take a very, very long time, if trends persist, to get majorities on gay marriage,\u201d Egan says. And then there\u2019s a question of a national standard that would allow married gay couples to be recognized in every state. Loving v. Virginia , the 1967 Supreme Court decision that invalidated legal prohibitions against interracial marriage, came at a time when most states had already abandoned their miscegenation laws. \u201cIt may be that a similar story will take place for gay marriage. Does the Supreme Court want to impose a 50-state standard now, or much later when gay-marriage bans are seen more as an anachronism?\u201d   Egan predicts that in 20 years, national law and policy on gay rights will resemble that of Massachusetts today: Same-sex marriage will likely be legal and recognized throughout the land, and there will be laws in place to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination in a variety of realms. And yet as any child of the civil rights era can attest, the culture often lags behind the law. Racial prejudice did not end with laws that prohibited discrimination, and segregation in housing and education persists, to some degree, even to this day. Likewise, Egan muses, if you \u201casked gay people in Massachusetts where they\u2019d feel comfortable holding their spouse\u2019s hand, they could probably identify only about 6 blocks within the whole state.\u201d   \u2014Eileen Reynolds   Follow Patrick Egan on Twitter .

But despite what we might remember from our school days, it turns out that the story of Spanish immigration doesn\u2019t stop at the colonial heyday of old Florida\u2019s St. Augustine.   Between 1880 and 1930, four million Spaniards arrived in the Americas\u2014more than the previous four centuries (1492-1880) combined, explains James Fern\u00e1ndez, an associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. But this fact would probably surprise the descendants of these immigrants, in part because their ties to the past are looser than those of other ethnic communities. Fern\u00e1ndez has found that Spanish-Americans living in, say, Donora, Pa., tend not to know of similar communities in places like Cherryvalle, Kan., or even Tampa, Fla.. Whereas the contributions of Irish-Americans and Italian-Americans are celebrated and mythologized in museums and parades galore, U.S. cities offer few cultural landmarks commemorating the Spanish-American experience.   But Fern\u00e1ndez is out to change that. Since 2010, he and his collaborator, the Spanish filmmaker and journalist Luis Argeo, have been traveling the country to conduct interviews and collect photographs and documents that tell the all-but-forgotten story of the scores of Spanish immigrants who settled\u2014and quickly assimilated\u2014in towns from Vermont to Hawaii during the first decades of the 20th century. The grandson of Spanish immigrants who met and married in New York City in the 1920s, Fern\u00e1ndez says he grew up believing that his grandparents\u2019 journey here was unique\u2014a perception that his interview subjects often share.   \u201cThis has become a lesson about how public memory is inscribed in private photo albums,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says of the archiving project, which he calls \u201c Ni Frailes ni Conquistadores (Neither Friars nor Conquistadors): Spanish Immigrants in the U.S., 1898-1936.\u201d As the 80- or 90-year-old daughters and sons of Spanish immigrants, Fernandez\u2019s sources are often able to put names to faces in family photos\u2014but don\u2019t always know the significance of pictures that were taken when they were still in diapers.   \u201cVery often the owners of these photo albums can\u2019t see beyond their private, intimate meaning\u2014but to someone with a historical perspective, they often contain valuable information,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. Among his own family\u2019s possessions, for example, Fern\u00e1ndez recently identified an unfamiliar man photographed with a group of his relatives as Jos\u00e9 Miaja, the Spanish Republican Army commander who led the defense of Madrid against siege by General Francisco Franco\u2019s troops during the Spanish Civil War.   For now, Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s growing archive lives online , and with the students in his 2011 undergraduate seminar on Spain in New York he built a website marking historic Spanish sites at and around NYU\u2019s Greenwich Village campus, which overlaps the neighborhood once known as New Spain. He and Argeo have also built a Facebook page, called Spanish Immigrants in the United States , where they post four times a day, sharing documents, photographs, and newspaper clippings and soliciting the same from their growing following of more than 2,000. Photos they share of celebrities, like the glamorous Rita Hayworth, whose father emigrated from Spain, garner a predictable flurry of \u201clikes.\u201d And food? \u201cIt drives \u2019em crazy!\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cI can start a fight on Facebook over who makes the best chorizo, or where the best Christmas cookies come from.\u201d   But the social network has also proved a valuable scholarly tool: Fern\u00e1ndez and Argeo have planned trips to St. Louis, Mo., San Leandro, Ca., to meet with Spanish-Americans with whom they first connected through Facebook. Their main source in Cleveland, a former flight attendant who had been carefully preserving her Spanish grandparents\u2019 archive, also found their project through the page. No two family\u2019s histories are identical, of course, but part of Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s charge is to stitch those apparently isolated stories into a broader narrative about an overlooked diaspora.   There were myriad reasons for leaving Spain in the first two decades of the 20th century: The Spanish economy was in shambles following the loss of its colonies in Cuba, the Philippines, Guam, and Puerto Rico after the Spanish-American War of 1898, and military conscription meant that young men could expect to die in similar bloody battles in Northern Africa as the former imperial power dwindled. Fleeing these conditions, many Spaniards moved first to Spanish-speaking Latin America, and then made their way from Mexico or Cuba to the United States. Others were recruited directly for work in specific industries, from sugarcane to canal digging to zinc mining.   \u201cAssimilation, for most of these folks, was incredibly fast and successful,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says\u2014which could be one reason few traces of Spanish identity remain in the communities where they settled. Another has to do with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Fernandez suspects that much Spanish settlement in the United States was somewhat accidental: Immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in the 1910s and 1920s with no intention of planting roots here decided not to return home only after Spain\u2019s democratic government was overthrown in Francisco Franco\u2019s fascist coup. His hypothesis is supported by a curious pattern he\u2019s noticed in family documents\u2014a glut of U.S. naturalization papers dated 1939, \u201940, and \u201941 for people who\u2019d been in the country since 1920 or earlier.   Complicating things further is the fact that those who opposed Franco and supported Spain\u2019s democratic loyalists ended up being targeted as communists during the McCarthy era\u2014leading some Spanish families to keep quiet about their roots. It\u2019s a practice analogous to German-Americans abandoning their own native celebrations and associations in the years following World War I. \u201cWe\u2019ve even found cases of families destroying or tearing the inscriptions off of photographs,&quot; Fernandez says. In that sense, he says, the stories that descendants of immigrants tend to misremember or even obscure are often as illuminating as the family memories they cherish.   For Fern\u00e1ndez, \u201cNi frailes ni conquistadores\u201d is also a journey of personal discovery: Though he\u2019s taught Spanish language and literature for years, it wasn\u2019t until recently that he contemplated the intersections between his academic interests and his family history. \u201cFor years I taught Federico Garcia Lorca, who came to New York in 1929 and wrote one of his major books of poems, Poeta in Nueva York, here,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez reflects. \u201cBut it never occurred to me that Lorca and abuelo [grandfather] inhabited the same sphere.\u201d   Reading Lorca\u2019s letters from New York back to his family in Spain, Fern\u00e1ndez found a mention of a lunch at a dive on the Hudson River that finally helped him to make the connection. \u201cLorca described the owner as an astute guy from Galicia who was selling bootleg liquor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt could\u2019ve been my grandfather serving that anise.\u201d   View the slideshow above to take Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s historic tour through hidden Spanish-American outposts in the U.S.   Top photo: Cleveland Spanish community picnic, June 1942, courtesy of Laura Goyanes. Employment opportunities in the heavy industries (steel, rubber, etc.) in and around Cleveland attracted large numbers of Spanish immigrants to the area in the 1910s and \u201920s, among them the Galician-born father of Oscar-winning actor Martin Sheen, who lived and worked in Dayton.       \u2014Eileen Reynolds                                                                                                                                                         NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
