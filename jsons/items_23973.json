The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

T he Educational Leadership program prepares students for leadership positions in education and policy at the community, school, district, state, and national levels. The demands of effective and responsive professional practice in education are increasingly complex. The curriculum addresses those complexities by including a solid grounding in understanding multiple perspectives in a multicultural environment.    Students critically examine the conceptual, organizational, political, social, managerial, interpersonal, and technical dimensions of leading schools as well as the social and educational support organizations that are vital to increasing educational opportunity for children and youth living in urban communities. The research agendas of the faculty and students center on the nexus between theory and practice and explore critical issues facing educational leaders and policymakers today. Collaborations between and among faculty and students and linkages with practicing educational leaders are important components of the program.    Effective immediately the Educational Leadership program has begun accepting applications for doctoral studies every other year.

Overview    Our program is grounded in the belief that advanced graduate study relevant to urban education and leadership requires an inquiry-based orientation to professional learning . Our curriculum is grounded in the contemporary context of educational practice. Students actively engage in a process that: develops habits of scholarship that are vital to understanding schools and communities; stimulates intellectual growth; and enhances the practical wisdom of good leaders. Our programs of study cultivate a deep understanding of life in schools and their communities and introduces the best of research to make sense of and inform leadership practice.    Our commitment is to support the work of leaders who care about enhancing opportunities for children and youth through programs that are relevant, engaging, challenging, and authentically linked to both the daily and enduring challenges of professional practice.

The Ed.D. program is a part-time cohort program that focuses on issues of research utilization to inform professional practice. Candidates must have a current higher education professional position or corporate education position with significant responsibility to be considered eligible. An extensive program of coursework in higher and postsecondary education can include the history of higher education; organizational theory; globalization; finance and governance; adult and workplace learning; and organizational studies. The culminating experience is a prospectus and project designed to improve professional practice through an intervention in the workplace that builds on knowledge of how others have dealt with the issue and incorporates an appropriate theoretical perspective.    Candidates must exhibit appropriate combinations of the following characteristics:       track record of increasing levels of professional responsibility;    masters degree relevant to the intended area of professional practice;    current professional position in a suitable setting closely linked to the specialization they intend to pursue;    appropriate goals;    strong recommendations from those in a position to judge academic interviews;    evidence of academic promise including past performance, purpose statement, interviews and GRE scores.       Program Outline    The Ed.D. program of study consists of 51 points beyond the masters degree. Part-time students are expected to complete the degree within three years of continuous study. During their first two semesters, students enroll in a higher education colloquium and a professional seminar where they are introduced to the literature of higher and postsecondary education and provided with the guidance that will help them in preparing for the sequence of research projects that will lead first to candidacy and subsequently to completion of the degree. More details are available in our current EdD Advising Guide.

T he Educational Leadership program prepares students for leadership positions in education and policy at the community, school, district, state, and national levels. The demands of effective and responsive professional practice in education are increasingly complex. The curriculum addresses those complexities by including a solid grounding in understanding multiple perspectives in a multicultural environment.    Students critically examine the conceptual, organizational, political, social, managerial, interpersonal, and technical dimensions of leading schools as well as the social and educational support organizations that are vital to increasing educational opportunity for children and youth living in urban communities. The research agendas of the faculty and students center on the nexus between theory and practice and explore critical issues facing educational leaders and policymakers today. Collaborations between and among faculty and students and linkages with practicing educational leaders are important components of the program.    Effective immediately the Educational Leadership program has begun accepting applications for doctoral studies every other year. Hence, no applications will be reviewed in academic year 2014/2015 for fall 2015 matriculation. Prospective applicants will need to apply during academic year 2015 for fall 2016 matriculation.    Overview    Our program is grounded in the belief that advanced graduate study relevant to urban education and leadership requires an inquiry-based orientation to professional learning . Our curriculum is grounded in the contemporary context of educational practice. Students actively engage in a process that: develops habits of scholarship that are vital to understanding schools and communities; stimulates intellectual growth; and enhances the practical wisdom of good leaders. Our programs of study cultivate a deep understanding of life in schools and their communities and introduces the best of research to make sense of and inform leadership practice.    Our commitment is to support the work of leaders who care about enhancing opportunities for children and youth through programs that are relevant, engaging, challenging, and authentically linked to both the daily and enduring challenges of professional practice. Our graduate students participate in critical examinations of the conceptual, organizational, political, social, interpersonal, and technical dimensions of schools and the communities they exist to serve.

The Ed.D. program is a part-time cohort program that focuses on issues of research utilization to inform professional practice. Candidates must have a current higher education professional position or corporate education position with significant responsibility to be considered eligible. An extensive program of coursework in higher and postsecondary education can include the history of higher education; organizational theory; globalization; finance and governance; adult and workplace learning; and organizational studies. The culminating experience is a prospectus and project designed to improve professional practice through an intervention in the workplace that builds on knowledge of how others have dealt with the issue and incorporates an appropriate theoretical perspective.    Candidates must exhibit appropriate combinations of the following characteristics:       track record of increasing levels of professional responsibility;    masters degree relevant to the intended area of professional practice;    current professional position in a suitable setting closely linked to the specialization they intend to pursue;    appropriate goals;    strong recommendations from those in a position to judge academic interviews;    evidence of academic promise including past performance, purpose statement, interviews and GRE scores.       Program Outline    The Ed.D. program of study consists of 51 points beyond the masters degree. Part-time students are expected to complete the degree within three years of continuous study. During their first two semesters, students enroll in a higher education colloquium and a professional seminar where they are introduced to the literature of higher and postsecondary education and provided with the guidance that will help them in preparing for the sequence of research projects that will lead first to candidacy and subsequently to completion of the degree.
