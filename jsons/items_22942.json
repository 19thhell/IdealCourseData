Whether you're studying in New York City or as far as Shanghai, NYU provides opportunities to engage in the global network through meaningful service. Global volunteerism provides an opportunity to learn about new cultures, explore rich history, and experience first-hand underlying causes of important social development needs within our communities.                           NYU Global Sites and Institutes                                                   NYU's global study abroad sites provide vast opportunities to engage in community service as part of the academic program or through co-curricular involvement. Participating in service opportunities while abroad is a great way to learn, explore the country, meet new people, and give back to your community.

NYU in Accra, Ghana                               Community service is a very strong and exciting component of the study abroad experience in Ghana. Volunteers donate their time regularly to over a dozen meaningful service organizations. Past students have found this aspect of the program personally rewarding and a great opportunity to give something back to the society.   For students interested in a more formal, reflexive fieldwork experience, NYU has created a new credit-bearing seminar in social and cultural analysis. While engaged in fieldwork at a selected set of community organizations and NGOs, students participate in an academic seminar that helps make sense of the issues that arise in their community work, the structure and methods of the organizations where they work, and their own place in the process.    Your experience as a community volunteer will be a highly individualized opportunity that enhances your cultural immersion. NYU in Ghana staff will help you select the appropriate organization for your volunteer experience, drawing on their relationships with local community organizations. For example, you may find yourself working with the Elim Cluster of Schools, where teach elementary students. At the West Africa AIDS Foundation, you'll assist with patient visits, counseling, and fund-raising events. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Buenos Aires                               To supplement in-class learning, NYU in Buenos Aires encourages students to conduct volunteer work in their areas of interest. Volunteering is a great way to connect to the local community and to put classroom theory into practice. Many students donate their time to nonprofits, hospitals, schools and other meaningful organizations. Most recently, students found opportunities with well-established NGOs specializing in public policy and the environment, including the Fundaci\u00f3n Poder Ciudadano and Greenpeace. A politics major donated her time to Mujeres 2000, an organization formed by students and young professionals that helps impoverished women. Along with local Argentine students, she then visited shantytowns on the outskirts of the city to provide counseling services and micro credits (small grants) to women in need. Another student cared for cancer patients and their families at a medical facility near the NYU academic center, while others tutored high-risk children and teens at local schools. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Florence                               NYU in Florence actively promotes volunteer opportunities in community service for its students. Working as instructors of English in Italian schools, or as assistants in a number of civic associations, NYU in Florence students get a chance to discover the \u201creal\u201d life of the city and its inhabitants. In addition, participating in the community service program offers an opportunity for students to make new contacts, and to improve their Italian language abilities. Some other service placements include cooking at a local church for their international youth dinners, giving free tours in English in the Florence Cathedral for a cultural organization, and helping to coach sports for an after-school program. Students who participate in Community Service find it one of the most rewarding features of their time in Florence. &gt;&gt; Read more .                                                              NYU in London                               NYU in London offers both ongoing and one-off Community Service opportunities. For students with a little more time, each semester we offer 30 placements in local schools for students who wish to work with teachers and help 5-7 year old children with their classes. We also have a limited number of semester-long placements at local volunteering organisations, including the American Church in London, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Maggie\u2019s Centres.For those students with less time to commit, we also offer a programme of one-off events which enables students to volunteer for a day or just a few hours. These events can vary from semester to semester. Previous students have acted as stewards for the Metro Life Hike in conjunction with Open House weekend to raise money for Maggie\u2019s Centres; formed \u201ccheering squads\u201d for charities to support their runners during the London Marathon; helped out by feeding meals to the homeless at the local Soup Kitchen; and taken part in environmental projects such as local gardening initiatives, clearing a conservation area and removing litter from the River Thames. &gt;&gt; Read more.                                                              NYU in Madrid                               If you'd like to put what you're learning in class into practice in the real world, NYU in Madrid offers opportunities for internships and community services. You may intern with Spanish firms, nongovernmental organizations, and private schools or volunteer with organizations that help the disadvantaged. Not only will you improve your Spanish, but you'll also learn about Hispanic culture from an insider's perspective. Please note that a high level of spoken Spanish is required for many of the immersion opportunities, although there are some options for intermediate speakers. In the U.S., volunteers are allowed certain independence with their schedules, whereas in Spain, volunteers are expected to make serious long-term commitments. &gt;&gt; Read More.

Whether you're studying in New York City or as far as Shanghai, NYU provides opportunities to engage in the global network through meaningful service. Global volunteerism provides an opportunity to learn about new cultures, explore rich history, and experience first-hand underlying causes of important social development needs within our communities.                           NYU Global Sites and Institutes                                                   NYU's global study abroad sites provide vast opportunities to engage in community service as part of the academic program or through co-curricular involvement. Participating in service opportunities while abroad is a great way to learn, explore the country, meet new people, and give back to your community. For more information about volunteer opportunities while studying abroad at NYU global sites, contact the NYU Office of Global Programs .                                                    NYU in Accra, Ghana                               Community service is a very strong and exciting component of the study abroad experience in Ghana. Volunteers donate their time regularly to over a dozen meaningful service organizations. Past students have found this aspect of the program personally rewarding and a great opportunity to give something back to the society.   For students interested in a more formal, reflexive fieldwork experience, NYU has created a new credit-bearing seminar in social and cultural analysis. While engaged in fieldwork at a selected set of community organizations and NGOs, students participate in an academic seminar that helps make sense of the issues that arise in their community work, the structure and methods of the organizations where they work, and their own place in the process.    Your experience as a community volunteer will be a highly individualized opportunity that enhances your cultural immersion. NYU in Ghana staff will help you select the appropriate organization for your volunteer experience, drawing on their relationships with local community organizations. For example, you may find yourself working with the Elim Cluster of Schools, where teach elementary students. At the West Africa AIDS Foundation, you'll assist with patient visits, counseling, and fund-raising events. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Buenos Aires                               To supplement in-class learning, NYU in Buenos Aires encourages students to conduct volunteer work in their areas of interest. Volunteering is a great way to connect to the local community and to put classroom theory into practice. Many students donate their time to nonprofits, hospitals, schools and other meaningful organizations. Most recently, students found opportunities with well-established NGOs specializing in public policy and the environment, including the Fundaci\u00f3n Poder Ciudadano and Greenpeace. A politics major donated her time to Mujeres 2000, an organization formed by students and young professionals that helps impoverished women. Along with local Argentine students, she then visited shantytowns on the outskirts of the city to provide counseling services and micro credits (small grants) to women in need. Another student cared for cancer patients and their families at a medical facility near the NYU academic center, while others tutored high-risk children and teens at local schools. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Florence                               NYU in Florence actively promotes volunteer opportunities in community service for its students. Working as instructors of English in Italian schools, or as assistants in a number of civic associations, NYU in Florence students get a chance to discover the \u201creal\u201d life of the city and its inhabitants. In addition, participating in the community service program offers an opportunity for students to make new contacts, and to improve their Italian language abilities. Some other service placements include cooking at a local church for their international youth dinners, giving free tours in English in the Florence Cathedral for a cultural organization, and helping to coach sports for an after-school program. Students who participate in Community Service find it one of the most rewarding features of their time in Florence. &gt;&gt; Read more .                                                              NYU in London                               NYU in London offers both ongoing and one-off Community Service opportunities. For students with a little more time, each semester we offer 30 placements in local schools for students who wish to work with teachers and help 5-7 year old children with their classes. We also have a limited number of semester-long placements at local volunteering organisations, including the American Church in London, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Maggie\u2019s Centres.For those students with less time to commit, we also offer a programme of one-off events which enables students to volunteer for a day or just a few hours. These events can vary from semester to semester. Previous students have acted as stewards for the Metro Life Hike in conjunction with Open House weekend to raise money for Maggie\u2019s Centres; formed \u201ccheering squads\u201d for charities to support their runners during the London Marathon; helped out by feeding meals to the homeless at the local Soup Kitchen; and taken part in environmental projects such as local gardening initiatives, clearing a conservation area and removing litter from the River Thames. &gt;&gt; Read more.                                                              NYU in Madrid                               If you'd like to put what you're learning in class into practice in the real world, NYU in Madrid offers opportunities for internships and community services. You may intern with Spanish firms, nongovernmental organizations, and private schools or volunteer with organizations that help the disadvantaged. Not only will you improve your Spanish, but you'll also learn about Hispanic culture from an insider's perspective. Please note that a high level of spoken Spanish is required for many of the immersion opportunities, although there are some options for intermediate speakers. In the U.S., volunteers are allowed certain independence with their schedules, whereas in Spain, volunteers are expected to make serious long-term commitments. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Shanghai                               Volunteering in Shanghai will introduce you to another side of Chinese culture and bring you into direct contact with many facets of the city you may not otherwise experience. You could donate your time working with a local school\u2019s program to educate children of migrant workers, or perhaps spend a day a week teaching English in a local school, or lend a hand at a children\u2019s orphanage. New volunteer and service activities become available to NYU in Shanghai students on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; Read More.

Whether you're studying in New York City or as far as Shanghai, NYU provides opportunities to engage in the global network through meaningful service. Global volunteerism provides an opportunity to learn about new cultures, explore rich history, and experience first-hand underlying causes of important social development needs within our communities.                           NYU Global Sites and Institutes                                                   NYU's global study abroad sites provide vast opportunities to engage in community service as part of the academic program or through co-curricular involvement.

NYU in Accra, Ghana                               Community service is a very strong and exciting component of the study abroad experience in Ghana. Volunteers donate their time regularly to over a dozen meaningful service organizations. Past students have found this aspect of the program personally rewarding and a great opportunity to give something back to the society.   For students interested in a more formal, reflexive fieldwork experience, NYU has created a new credit-bearing seminar in social and cultural analysis. While engaged in fieldwork at a selected set of community organizations and NGOs, students participate in an academic seminar that helps make sense of the issues that arise in their community work, the structure and methods of the organizations where they work, and their own place in the process.    Your experience as a community volunteer will be a highly individualized opportunity that enhances your cultural immersion. NYU in Ghana staff will help you select the appropriate organization for your volunteer experience, drawing on their relationships with local community organizations. For example, you may find yourself working with the Elim Cluster of Schools, where teach elementary students. At the West Africa AIDS Foundation, you'll assist with patient visits, counseling, and fund-raising events. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Buenos Aires                               To supplement in-class learning, NYU in Buenos Aires encourages students to conduct volunteer work in their areas of interest. Volunteering is a great way to connect to the local community and to put classroom theory into practice. Many students donate their time to nonprofits, hospitals, schools and other meaningful organizations. Most recently, students found opportunities with well-established NGOs specializing in public policy and the environment, including the Fundaci\u00f3n Poder Ciudadano and Greenpeace. A politics major donated her time to Mujeres 2000, an organization formed by students and young professionals that helps impoverished women. Along with local Argentine students, she then visited shantytowns on the outskirts of the city to provide counseling services and micro credits (small grants) to women in need. Another student cared for cancer patients and their families at a medical facility near the NYU academic center, while others tutored high-risk children and teens at local schools. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Florence                               NYU in Florence actively promotes volunteer opportunities in community service for its students. Working as instructors of English in Italian schools, or as assistants in a number of civic associations, NYU in Florence students get a chance to discover the \u201creal\u201d life of the city and its inhabitants. In addition, participating in the community service program offers an opportunity for students to make new contacts, and to improve their Italian language abilities. Some other service placements include cooking at a local church for their international youth dinners, giving free tours in English in the Florence Cathedral for a cultural organization, and helping to coach sports for an after-school program. Students who participate in Community Service find it one of the most rewarding features of their time in Florence. &gt;&gt; Read more .                                                              NYU in London                               NYU in London offers both ongoing and one-off Community Service opportunities. For students with a little more time, each semester we offer 30 placements in local schools for students who wish to work with teachers and help 5-7 year old children with their classes. We also have a limited number of semester-long placements at local volunteering organisations, including the American Church in London, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Maggie\u2019s Centres.For those students with less time to commit, we also offer a programme of one-off events which enables students to volunteer for a day or just a few hours. These events can vary from semester to semester. Previous students have acted as stewards for the Metro Life Hike in conjunction with Open House weekend to raise money for Maggie\u2019s Centres; formed \u201ccheering squads\u201d for charities to support their runners during the London Marathon; helped out by feeding meals to the homeless at the local Soup Kitchen; and taken part in environmental projects such as local gardening initiatives, clearing a conservation area and removing litter from the River Thames. &gt;&gt; Read more.                                                              NYU in Madrid                               If you'd like to put what you're learning in class into practice in the real world, NYU in Madrid offers opportunities for internships and community services. You may intern with Spanish firms, nongovernmental organizations, and private schools or volunteer with organizations that help the disadvantaged. Not only will you improve your Spanish, but you'll also learn about Hispanic culture from an insider's perspective. Please note that a high level of spoken Spanish is required for many of the immersion opportunities, although there are some options for intermediate speakers. In the U.S., volunteers are allowed certain independence with their schedules, whereas in Spain, volunteers are expected to make serious long-term commitments. &gt;&gt; Read More.

Whether you're studying in New York City or as far as Shanghai, NYU provides opportunities to engage in the global network through meaningful service. Global volunteerism provides an opportunity to learn about new cultures, explore rich history, and experience first-hand underlying causes of important social development needs within our communities.                           NYU Global Sites and Institutes                                                   NYU's global study abroad sites provide vast opportunities to engage in community service as part of the academic program or through co-curricular involvement. Participating in service opportunities while abroad is a great way to learn, explore the country, meet new people, and give back to your community. For more information about volunteer opportunities while studying abroad at NYU global sites, contact the NYU Office of Global Programs .                                                    NYU in Accra, Ghana                               Community service is a very strong and exciting component of the study abroad experience in Ghana. Volunteers donate their time regularly to over a dozen meaningful service organizations. Past students have found this aspect of the program personally rewarding and a great opportunity to give something back to the society.   For students interested in a more formal, reflexive fieldwork experience, NYU has created a new credit-bearing seminar in social and cultural analysis. While engaged in fieldwork at a selected set of community organizations and NGOs, students participate in an academic seminar that helps make sense of the issues that arise in their community work, the structure and methods of the organizations where they work, and their own place in the process.    Your experience as a community volunteer will be a highly individualized opportunity that enhances your cultural immersion. NYU in Ghana staff will help you select the appropriate organization for your volunteer experience, drawing on their relationships with local community organizations. For example, you may find yourself working with the Elim Cluster of Schools, where teach elementary students. At the West Africa AIDS Foundation, you'll assist with patient visits, counseling, and fund-raising events. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Buenos Aires                               To supplement in-class learning, NYU in Buenos Aires encourages students to conduct volunteer work in their areas of interest. Volunteering is a great way to connect to the local community and to put classroom theory into practice. Many students donate their time to nonprofits, hospitals, schools and other meaningful organizations. Most recently, students found opportunities with well-established NGOs specializing in public policy and the environment, including the Fundaci\u00f3n Poder Ciudadano and Greenpeace. A politics major donated her time to Mujeres 2000, an organization formed by students and young professionals that helps impoverished women. Along with local Argentine students, she then visited shantytowns on the outskirts of the city to provide counseling services and micro credits (small grants) to women in need. Another student cared for cancer patients and their families at a medical facility near the NYU academic center, while others tutored high-risk children and teens at local schools. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Florence                               NYU in Florence actively promotes volunteer opportunities in community service for its students. Working as instructors of English in Italian schools, or as assistants in a number of civic associations, NYU in Florence students get a chance to discover the \u201creal\u201d life of the city and its inhabitants. In addition, participating in the community service program offers an opportunity for students to make new contacts, and to improve their Italian language abilities. Some other service placements include cooking at a local church for their international youth dinners, giving free tours in English in the Florence Cathedral for a cultural organization, and helping to coach sports for an after-school program. Students who participate in Community Service find it one of the most rewarding features of their time in Florence. &gt;&gt; Read more .                                                              NYU in London                               NYU in London offers both ongoing and one-off Community Service opportunities. For students with a little more time, each semester we offer 30 placements in local schools for students who wish to work with teachers and help 5-7 year old children with their classes. We also have a limited number of semester-long placements at local volunteering organisations, including the American Church in London, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and Maggie\u2019s Centres.For those students with less time to commit, we also offer a programme of one-off events which enables students to volunteer for a day or just a few hours. These events can vary from semester to semester. Previous students have acted as stewards for the Metro Life Hike in conjunction with Open House weekend to raise money for Maggie\u2019s Centres; formed \u201ccheering squads\u201d for charities to support their runners during the London Marathon; helped out by feeding meals to the homeless at the local Soup Kitchen; and taken part in environmental projects such as local gardening initiatives, clearing a conservation area and removing litter from the River Thames. &gt;&gt; Read more.                                                              NYU in Madrid                               If you'd like to put what you're learning in class into practice in the real world, NYU in Madrid offers opportunities for internships and community services. You may intern with Spanish firms, nongovernmental organizations, and private schools or volunteer with organizations that help the disadvantaged. Not only will you improve your Spanish, but you'll also learn about Hispanic culture from an insider's perspective. Please note that a high level of spoken Spanish is required for many of the immersion opportunities, although there are some options for intermediate speakers. In the U.S., volunteers are allowed certain independence with their schedules, whereas in Spain, volunteers are expected to make serious long-term commitments. &gt;&gt; Read More.                                                              NYU in Shanghai                               Volunteering in Shanghai will introduce you to another side of Chinese culture and bring you into direct contact with many facets of the city you may not otherwise experience. You could donate your time working with a local school\u2019s program to educate children of migrant workers, or perhaps spend a day a week teaching English in a local school, or lend a hand at a children\u2019s orphanage. New volunteer and service activities become available to NYU in Shanghai students on a regular basis. &gt;&gt; Read More.

We are guided by a key NYU tradition: being \u201ca private university in the public service.\u201d   The NYU Office of Civic Engagement (OCE) coordinates three types of programs to serve the community, outside of the many clinical and outreach programs conducted by NYU's leading professional schools.                                   Support for Nonprofit Organizations     OCE awards grants to local organizations, with programs that encourage civic participation amongst the NYU community and channel valuable support to our non-profit neighbors.
