Databetes  Founders, Doug Kanter (Tisch, ITP, '13), D'arcy Saum, and Ryan Viglizzo (Tisch, ITP, '13), of Databetes were awarded $25,000 . Databetes explores new ways of using data to improve health outcomes for people with diabetes. It is uniquely positioned to provide web and mobile-based software delivering data-driven clinical and educational services. Social Venture Competition Winner The Social Venture Prize of $50,000 was awarded to Kinvolved.  Kinvolved Kinvolved, founded by Miriam Altman (Wagner, MPA, '13), Alexandra Meis (Wagner, MPA, '13), and Barrie Charney Golden (Wagner/Stern, MPA/MBA, '14), seeks to improve classroom attendance, particularly among underserved students.

New Venture Competition Winner  The Ira Leon Rennert Prize of $75,000 was made possible by a gift from NYU Stern alumnus and member of Stern's Board of Overseers, Ira Leon Rennert (MBA, '56). This New Venture Prize was awarded to Smart Vision Labs.  Smart Vision Labs  Founders, Marc Albanese (Stern, '08) and Yaopeng Zhou (Stern, '14), of Smart Vision Labs developed the Smart Aberromete r, a portable vision examination device. With a single snap shot, the Smart Aberrometer will be able to measure refractive errors of the eye and generate prescriptions &ndash; all without patient interactions. The pocket sized, low cost device uses the flash light and camera of the smartphone, combined with an add-on microlens array. The Smart Aberromete r will dramatically improve the way people get their vision evaluated.                                                2012-2013 Venture Competitions   Find a list of the finalist teams here.
