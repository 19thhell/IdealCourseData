New York University's Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs:       The PhD program in Higher and Postsecondary Education    The EdD program in Higher and Postsecondary Education       Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension, issues of access and equity, state and federal policy, student development, workplace learning, and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different.       The PhD program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty members, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers.    In contrast, the EdD program is designed to meet the increasing need for visionary and entrepreneurial leaders in community colleges, four-year colleges and universities, corporate-sponsored education, and governmental agencies. Candidates must have a current higher education professional position or corporate education position with significant responsibility to be considered eligible. The objectives of the EdD program include providing:    Meaningful learning opportunities for employed professionals to earn a terminal degree in an integrated curriculum with immediate applicability to their professional settings    A coherent and flexible combination of theory, skills development, research and problem solving, and a culminating project that will clearly add value to and enhance the knowledge of professional settings participants will bring with them    Common learning experiences in leadership , organizations, policy, and applied research while concurrently enjoying the opportunity for study directly related to practice settings          Our doctoral students come from a broad range of backgrounds.

Others have had significant experience in higher education policy. The program takes advantage of the wide range of backgrounds of our students to create a vibrant educational experience, embracing important contemporary issues shaping culture and practice in higher education.    Before applying to the Ph.D. or Ed.D. program, prospective students are strongly encouraged to speak with faculty via a campus visit.

The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education.

The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.

The curriculum encompasses broad themes in the history and development of higher education both in the U.S. and abroad, and includes the study of colleges as institutions; student learning and development; the profession of student affairs; research and assessment methods; access to higher education and diversity, and the theory and practice of leadership.    Our program selects students who have performed very well academically in their undergraduate years. We seek applicants who have demonstrated a commitment to higher education, student affairs, community engagement, or public policy.    Our program allows for full-time or part-time study . M.A. students in both program tracks are active members of the University community. Students are involved in the Association of Student Affairs Professionals ( ASAP ), the NYU Journal of Student Affairs , and other NYU student organizations.    Full-Time Study    All full-time students are required to have paid internships of 20 hours a week while they pursue the two-year curriculum (36 credits). The internships provide a stipend and modest tuition support as well as extremely valuable practical experience and socialization into the profession. Students also take three courses each semester (courses are available during winter and summer breaks as well) and complete a Capstone Project summarizing their professional and academic development during their second year.    Part-Time Study    Part-time students must have a full time position in higher education to enroll in the master's program. A typical course load is one to two course per semester until the student reaches the required 36 credits. Courses are also available during winter and summer breaks. The pace of the part-time experience is individualized to the student, but most complete the program in approximately three years. Part-time students also complete a Capstone Project summarizing their professional and academic development prior to graduation.    Special Note on Admissions    Applicants with some prior work experience are preferred for the master's program in Higher Education and Student Affairs.

The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

The curriculum encompasses broad themes in the history and development of higher education both in the U.S. and abroad, and includes the study of colleges as institutions; student learning and development; the profession of student affairs; research and assessment methods; access to higher education and diversity, and the theory and practice of leadership.    Our program selects students who have performed very well academically in their undergraduate years. We seek applicants who have demonstrated a commitment to higher education, student affairs, community engagement, or public policy.    Our program allows for full-time or part-time study . M.A. students in both program tracks are active members of the University community. Students are involved in the Association of Student Affairs Professionals ( ASAP ), the NYU Journal of Student Affairs , and other NYU student organizations.    Full-Time Study    All full-time students are required to have paid internships of 20 hours a week while they pursue the two-year curriculum (36 credits). The internships provide a stipend and modest tuition support as well as extremely valuable practical experience and socialization into the profession. Students also take three courses each semester (courses are available during winter and summer breaks as well) and complete a Capstone Project summarizing their professional and academic development during their second year.    Part-Time Study    Part-time students must have a full time position in higher education to enroll in the master's program. A typical course load is one to two course per semester until the student reaches the required 36 credits. Courses are also available during winter and summer breaks. The pace of the part-time experience is individualized to the student, but most complete the program in approximately three years. Part-time students also complete a Capstone Project summarizing their professional and academic development prior to graduation.    Special Note on Admissions    Applicants with some prior work experience are preferred for the master's program in Higher Education and Student Affairs.
