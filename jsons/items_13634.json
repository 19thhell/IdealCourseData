The program leads to dual certification as a teacher of Spanish for grades 7-12 and as a teacher of English as a Second Language (TESOL) for grades K-12.    The program is offered jointly by Steinhardt&rsquo;s Foreign Language Education Program and NYU Madrid, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures , Graduate School of Arts and Science.    Students receive high-quality, academically rigorous training in content and pedagogical knowledge and immersion in Spanish culture so that they can become linguistically and culturally competent teachers of Spanish and ESL, and effectively address the needs of linguistically and culturally diverse students.    The program provides professional training in three areas:       mastery of the Spanish language    teaching Spanish as a foreign language    teaching English as a Second Language (ESL)       Graduates are prepared to become teachers in public, charter and independent schools or in other educational or community settings as a teacher of Spanish, a teacher of English to non-native speakers, or both.    Teaching and Learning at NYU Madrid       Spanish Immersion Year One (two semesters) at NYU Madrid in Spain allows students to immerse themselves in Spanish language and culture as a means to improving and refining their language skills and socio-cultural expertise.  Students work closely with Spanish pedagogues in the field of foreign language acquisition, drawing on the expertise of US-trained applied linguists, as well as distinguished faculty from the Department of Philology (Facultad de Filolog&iacute;a) of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid through NYU Madrid.          Pedagogical Learning Specialists in the field of foreign language acquisition and authors of language textbooks are among the faculty from NYU Madrid and from Spanish universities who mentor students closely and guide them through a critical reflection of teaching and learning. Areas of academic inquiry include foreign language instruction, grammar, phonetics, socio- and psycho-linguistics, contemporary Spanish civilization, Spanish literature, the history of ideas, teaching pedagogy, and the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language in Spain. Language study at NYU Madrid exposes MA students to Spanish in all its variations so that aspiring Spanish teachers can be familiar with different language uses and accents and prepared to work in classrooms with learners from different backgrounds and cultures. The hallmark of the program in Madrid and of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures is its trans-Atlantic and inter-American focus. Faculty and curricula bridge traditional divides between Spain and Spanish America; between North and South America; and between Spanish America and Brazil, in order to rethink historical, literary, and linguistic boundaries from new perspectives.          Cultural Experiences A young, ethnically diverse, and culturally vibrant city, Madrid is home to growing Latin American communities, a focal point where the Iberian and Latin American worlds meet. The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students are encouraged to explore and immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life.  All students are provided with a membership to Madrid: Cultura y Arte, which provides significant discounts on a vast array of cultural activities, screenings, and exhibitions throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ .       Teaching and Learning in New York    Year Two (two semesters) takes place in New York City at NYU's Washington Square campus, where students take course work in language education and TESOL, and complete student teaching placements in New York City Schools.       Pedagogical Learning Core courses cover general pedagogical issues as well as knowledge critical to foreign language teaching and learning. These include: inquiries in teaching and learning, adolescent development, teaching students with special needs, and content-based pedagogical courses including intercultural perspectives, methods and techniques of communicative teaching, language through content, language assessment, and second language acquisition research. Students also have an option to take an additional summer course to extend their certification to include teaching foreign languages at the K-6 level.          Field Experiences During their two semesters in New York City, students complete their required two semesters of field experiences at NYC public schools, with one semester in a middle school or high school (student teaching Spanish) and a second semester in an elementary school (student teaching TESOL).       Orientations    All students participate in:       A week-long orientation in Madrid before the start of Year One Fall classes    A pre-NYC orientation in the Spring term while still in Madrid    An orientation to New York City prior to the start of Year Two Fall classes       Degree Requirements    Students must enroll for full-time study (at least 12 points) for the two semesters at NYU Madrid and are expected to study full time during the second year in Washington Square.

The program leads to dual certification as a teacher of Spanish for grades 7-12 and as a teacher of English as a Second Language (TESOL) for grades K-12.    The program is offered jointly by Steinhardt&rsquo;s Foreign Language Education Program and NYU Madrid, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures , Graduate School of Arts and Science.    Students receive high-quality, academically rigorous training in content and pedagogical knowledge and immersion in Spanish culture so that they can become linguistically and culturally competent teachers of Spanish and ESL, and effectively address the needs of linguistically and culturally diverse students.    The program provides professional training in three areas:       mastery of the Spanish language    teaching Spanish as a foreign language    teaching English as a Second Language (ESL)       Graduates are prepared to become teachers in public, charter and independent schools or in other educational or community settings as a teacher of Spanish, a teacher of English to non-native speakers, or both.    Teaching and Learning at NYU Madrid       Spanish Immersion Year One (two semesters) at NYU Madrid in Spain allows students to immerse themselves in Spanish language and culture as a means to improving and refining their language skills and socio-cultural expertise.  Students work closely with Spanish pedagogues in the field of foreign language acquisition, drawing on the expertise of US-trained applied linguists, as well as distinguished faculty from the Department of Philology (Facultad de Filolog&iacute;a) of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid and the Universidad Aut&oacute;noma de Madrid through NYU Madrid.          Pedagogical Learning Specialists in the field of foreign language acquisition and authors of language textbooks are among the faculty from NYU Madrid and from Spanish universities who mentor students closely and guide them through a critical reflection of teaching and learning. Areas of academic inquiry include foreign language instruction, grammar, phonetics, socio- and psycho-linguistics, contemporary Spanish civilization, Spanish literature, the history of ideas, teaching pedagogy, and the teaching of Spanish as a foreign language in Spain. Language study at NYU Madrid exposes MA students to Spanish in all its variations so that aspiring Spanish teachers can be familiar with different language uses and accents and prepared to work in classrooms with learners from different backgrounds and cultures. The hallmark of the program in Madrid and of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures is its trans-Atlantic and inter-American focus. Faculty and curricula bridge traditional divides between Spain and Spanish America; between North and South America; and between Spanish America and Brazil, in order to rethink historical, literary, and linguistic boundaries from new perspectives.          Cultural Experiences A young, ethnically diverse, and culturally vibrant city, Madrid is home to growing Latin American communities, a focal point where the Iberian and Latin American worlds meet. The program takes full advantage of the vast range of cultural activities and events in Madrid, which form an integral part of the curriculum. Students are encouraged to explore and immerse themselves linguistically and culturally in Madrid life.  All students are provided with a membership to Madrid: Cultura y Arte, which provides significant discounts on a vast array of cultural activities, screenings, and exhibitions throughout the year. An integral part of the core curriculum and orientation program, visits and study trips give students the unique opportunity to investigate Spanish culture in situ .       Teaching and Learning in New York    Year Two (two semesters) takes place in New York City at NYU's Washington Square campus, where students take course work in language education and TESOL, and complete student teaching placements in New York City Schools.
