Graduates are eligible for initial/professional certification in Teaching Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), grades 7-12.    Key Features       Immersion in a public school classroom As a CRISP teacher resident, you will spend three weeks in July at a middle school in Brooklyn and then 4 days a week from September through June in one of three host middle or high schools on Manhattan's Lower East Side, such as The Dr. Sun Yat Sen School (M.S. 131). You will work closely with your classroom teacher/mentor and your school's senior leadership and science faculty, and receive intensive weekly coaching by your mentor, the CRISP Residency Coach, and NYU's Urban Master Teacher in Science.          Increasing responsibility as a classroom teacher You will start the school year in September as an observer and assistant in one science class and progress to co-teaching two science classes &ndash; one with younger students and the other with older students &ndash; assuming joint responsibility for planning, teaching, and managing those classes.          Dual focus on groups of learners and individual learners In addition to learning to teach a full class, you will also work with individual students to understand and address their special learning needs. You will follow closely and tutor a small group of students and take responsibility for improving their individual academic outcomes. Your group will include literacy-challenged students, students with Individualized Education Plans, English language learners, and students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.          Focused explorations of classrooms and other learning environments You will participate, on a weekly or near-weekly basis, in instructional \"rounds\" led by NYU and school faculty, similar to clinical rounds common in medical education. Rounds will visit fellow CRISP residents' classrooms, other learning environments in the host and nearby schools, and community settings, such as the Henry Street Settlement and the New York City Center for Space Science Education. Through observation and analysis you will gain perspective on the important dimensions of establishing classroom and laboratory systems, norms, and behavioral habits.          Academic courses offered on site in host schools NYU Steinhardt faculty teach selected graduate courses in teaching, literacy and language acquisition, and data and assessment on site in host schools. These field-based courses integrate your experiences in the classroom and with your small groups into your coursework and provide opportunities for you to interact with and learn from members of school inquiry teams, early career teachers, and master teachers.          Campus-based courses and networking Year-long courses combine work on campus, work in the field, and online learning to immerse you in modern science concepts, scientific advances, and research.          Technology-infused curriculum You will use technology throughout the teacher residency program &ndash; smart boards in classrooms, iPad-based or other handheld text and video exchanges, blogs and wikis, Cisco-supported video- and teleconferencing, online course work in collaboration with our partner, the American Museum of Natural History, and web-based courseware. Your own use of new media and technologies prepares you to incorporate multimedia teaching and learning techniques into your own classroom practice.          Generous scholarships CRISP students receive a $30,000 tuition scholarship from NYU Steinhardt (must be U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. to be offered a scholarship) .       CRISP strives to prepare teachers who:       know science deeply and are connected to a community of scientists and science educators    know intimately and are prepared to meet the challenges of teaching students affected by poverty, disabilities, and deficits in academic literacy    have the skills, tools, dispositions, and connections to learning communities in order to thrive as early-career teachers and to ensure their students thrive as well    will stay in teaching, serving students in greatest need of their teaching                                                                                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

The curriculum immerses aspiring teachers in the science classroom and integrates theory, practice, and science content into daily teaching and learning experiences.    Graduates are eligible for initial/professional certification in Teaching Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), grades 7-12.    Key Features       Immersion in a public school classroom As a CRISP teacher resident, you will spend three weeks in July at a middle school in Brooklyn and then 4 days a week from September through June in one of three host middle or high schools on Manhattan's Lower East Side, such as The Dr. Sun Yat Sen School (M.S. 131). You will work closely with your classroom teacher/mentor and your school's senior leadership and science faculty, and receive intensive weekly coaching by your mentor, the CRISP Residency Coach, and NYU's Urban Master Teacher in Science.          Increasing responsibility as a classroom teacher You will start the school year in September as an observer and assistant in one science class and progress to co-teaching two science classes &ndash; one with younger students and the other with older students &ndash; assuming joint responsibility for planning, teaching, and managing those classes.          Dual focus on groups of learners and individual learners In addition to learning to teach a full class, you will also work with individual students to understand and address their special learning needs. You will follow closely and tutor a small group of students and take responsibility for improving their individual academic outcomes. Your group will include literacy-challenged students, students with Individualized Education Plans, English language learners, and students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.          Focused explorations of classrooms and other learning environments You will participate, on a weekly or near-weekly basis, in instructional \"rounds\" led by NYU and school faculty, similar to clinical rounds common in medical education. Rounds will visit fellow CRISP residents' classrooms, other learning environments in the host and nearby schools, and community settings, such as the Henry Street Settlement and the New York City Center for Space Science Education. Through observation and analysis you will gain perspective on the important dimensions of establishing classroom and laboratory systems, norms, and behavioral habits.          Academic courses offered on site in host schools NYU Steinhardt faculty teach selected graduate courses in teaching, literacy and language acquisition, and data and assessment on site in host schools. These field-based courses integrate your experiences in the classroom and with your small groups into your coursework and provide opportunities for you to interact with and learn from members of school inquiry teams, early career teachers, and master teachers.          Campus-based courses and networking Year-long courses combine work on campus, work in the field, and online learning to immerse you in modern science concepts, scientific advances, and research.          Technology-infused curriculum You will use technology throughout the teacher residency program &ndash; smart boards in classrooms, iPad-based or other handheld text and video exchanges, blogs and wikis, Cisco-supported video- and teleconferencing, online course work in collaboration with our partner, the American Museum of Natural History, and web-based courseware. Your own use of new media and technologies prepares you to incorporate multimedia teaching and learning techniques into your own classroom practice.          Generous scholarships CRISP students receive a $30,000 tuition scholarship from NYU Steinhardt (must be U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. to be offered a scholarship) .       CRISP strives to prepare teachers who:       know science deeply and are connected to a community of scientists and science educators    know intimately and are prepared to meet the challenges of teaching students affected by poverty, disabilities, and deficits in academic literacy    have the skills, tools, dispositions, and connections to learning communities in order to thrive as early-career teachers and to ensure their students thrive as well    will stay in teaching, serving students in greatest need of their teaching                                                                                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

Today, we supplement our emphasis on science, technology, and society with a focus on training teachers to adapt curricula to multicultural environments, especially in urban areas, so that all students feel more at home in studying science.    Accelerated Dual BA in Science/MA in Science Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual-degree programs , including a BA Science/MA Science Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual degree programs or accelerated options qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    MA, Clinically Rich Integrated Science Program (CRISP)    This one-year teacher residency program prepares career changers and college graduates to become science teachers in urban public schools. The curriculum immerses aspiring teachers in the science classroom and integrates theory, practice, and science content into daily teaching and learning experiences. Graduates are eligible for initial/professional certification in New York State in Teaching Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), grades 7-12.    Special note : The Program in Science Education is currently not admitting students to its regular (non-teacher residency) two-year initial certification master's curriculum.    PhD in Teaching and Learning with a Focus on Science and Environmental Education    NYU Steinhardt is seeking exceptional doctoral applicants who are committed to scholarship and action in educational settings, have a background in science, and would like to pursue a PhD in Teaching and Learning, with a focus on science and environmental education.

The curriculum immerses aspiring teachers in the science classroom and integrates theory, practice, and science content into daily teaching and learning experiences.    Graduates are eligible for initial/professional certification in Teaching Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), grades 7-12.    Key Features       Immersion in a public school classroom As a CRISP teacher resident, you will spend three weeks in July at a middle school in Brooklyn and then 4 days a week from September through June in one of three host middle or high schools on Manhattan's Lower East Side, such as The Dr. Sun Yat Sen School (M.S. 131). You will work closely with your classroom teacher/mentor and your school's senior leadership and science faculty, and receive intensive weekly coaching by your mentor, the CRISP Residency Coach, and NYU's Urban Master Teacher in Science.          Increasing responsibility as a classroom teacher You will start the school year in September as an observer and assistant in one science class and progress to co-teaching two science classes &ndash; one with younger students and the other with older students &ndash; assuming joint responsibility for planning, teaching, and managing those classes.          Dual focus on groups of learners and individual learners In addition to learning to teach a full class, you will also work with individual students to understand and address their special learning needs. You will follow closely and tutor a small group of students and take responsibility for improving their individual academic outcomes. Your group will include literacy-challenged students, students with Individualized Education Plans, English language learners, and students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.          Focused explorations of classrooms and other learning environments You will participate, on a weekly or near-weekly basis, in instructional \"rounds\" led by NYU and school faculty, similar to clinical rounds common in medical education. Rounds will visit fellow CRISP residents' classrooms, other learning environments in the host and nearby schools, and community settings, such as the Henry Street Settlement and the New York City Center for Space Science Education. Through observation and analysis you will gain perspective on the important dimensions of establishing classroom and laboratory systems, norms, and behavioral habits.          Academic courses offered on site in host schools NYU Steinhardt faculty teach selected graduate courses in teaching, literacy and language acquisition, and data and assessment on site in host schools. These field-based courses integrate your experiences in the classroom and with your small groups into your coursework and provide opportunities for you to interact with and learn from members of school inquiry teams, early career teachers, and master teachers.          Campus-based courses and networking Year-long courses combine work on campus, work in the field, and online learning to immerse you in modern science concepts, scientific advances, and research.          Technology-infused curriculum You will use technology throughout the teacher residency program &ndash; smart boards in classrooms, iPad-based or other handheld text and video exchanges, blogs and wikis, Cisco-supported video- and teleconferencing, online course work in collaboration with our partner, the American Museum of Natural History, and web-based courseware. Your own use of new media and technologies prepares you to incorporate multimedia teaching and learning techniques into your own classroom practice.          Generous scholarships CRISP students receive a $30,000 tuition scholarship from NYU Steinhardt (must be U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. to be offered a scholarship) .       CRISP strives to prepare teachers who:       know science deeply and are connected to a community of scientists and science educators    know intimately and are prepared to meet the challenges of teaching students affected by poverty, disabilities, and deficits in academic literacy    have the skills, tools, dispositions, and connections to learning communities in order to thrive as early-career teachers and to ensure their students thrive as well    will stay in teaching, serving students in greatest need of their teaching                                                                                          This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

The curriculum immerses aspiring teachers in the science classroom and integrates theory, practice, and science content into daily teaching and learning experiences.    Graduates are eligible for initial/professional certification in Teaching Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), grades 7-12.    Key Features       Immersion in a public school classroom As a CRISP teacher resident, you will spend three weeks in July at a middle school in Brooklyn and then 4 days a week from September through June in one of three host middle or high schools on Manhattan's Lower East Side, such as The Dr. Sun Yat Sen School (M.S. 131). You will work closely with your classroom teacher/mentor and your school's senior leadership and science faculty, and receive intensive weekly coaching by your mentor, the CRISP Residency Coach, and NYU's Urban Master Teacher in Science.          Increasing responsibility as a classroom teacher You will start the school year in September as an observer and assistant in one science class and progress to co-teaching two science classes &ndash; one with younger students and the other with older students &ndash; assuming joint responsibility for planning, teaching, and managing those classes.          Dual focus on groups of learners and individual learners In addition to learning to teach a full class, you will also work with individual students to understand and address their special learning needs. You will follow closely and tutor a small group of students and take responsibility for improving their individual academic outcomes. Your group will include literacy-challenged students, students with Individualized Education Plans, English language learners, and students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.          Focused explorations of classrooms and other learning environments You will participate, on a weekly or near-weekly basis, in instructional \"rounds\" led by NYU and school faculty, similar to clinical rounds common in medical education. Rounds will visit fellow CRISP residents' classrooms, other learning environments in the host and nearby schools, and community settings, such as the Henry Street Settlement and the New York City Center for Space Science Education. Through observation and analysis you will gain perspective on the important dimensions of establishing classroom and laboratory systems, norms, and behavioral habits.          Academic courses offered on site in host schools NYU Steinhardt faculty teach selected graduate courses in teaching, literacy and language acquisition, and data and assessment on site in host schools. These field-based courses integrate your experiences in the classroom and with your small groups into your coursework and provide opportunities for you to interact with and learn from members of school inquiry teams, early career teachers, and master teachers.          Campus-based courses and networking Year-long courses combine work on campus, work in the field, and online learning to immerse you in modern science concepts, scientific advances, and research.          Technology-infused curriculum You will use technology throughout the teacher residency program &ndash; smart boards in classrooms, iPad-based or other handheld text and video exchanges, blogs and wikis, Cisco-supported video- and teleconferencing, online course work in collaboration with our partner, the American Museum of Natural History, and web-based courseware. Your own use of new media and technologies prepares you to incorporate multimedia teaching and learning techniques into your own classroom practice.          Generous scholarships CRISP students receive a $30,000 tuition scholarship from NYU Steinhardt (must be U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. to be offered a scholarship) .

Today, we supplement our emphasis on science, technology, and society with a focus on training teachers to adapt curricula to multicultural environments, especially in urban areas, so that all students feel more at home in studying science.    Accelerated Dual BA in Science/MA in Science Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual-degree programs , including a BA Science/MA Science Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual degree programs or accelerated options qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    MA, Clinically Rich Integrated Science Program (CRISP)    This one-year teacher residency program prepares career changers and college graduates to become science teachers in urban public schools. The curriculum immerses aspiring teachers in the science classroom and integrates theory, practice, and science content into daily teaching and learning experiences. Graduates are eligible for initial/professional certification in New York State in Teaching Science (Biology, Chemistry, or Physics), grades 7-12.    Special note : The Program in Science Education is currently not admitting students to its regular (non-teacher residency) two-year initial certification master's curriculum.    PhD in Teaching and Learning with a Focus on Science and Environmental Education    NYU Steinhardt is seeking exceptional doctoral applicants who are committed to scholarship and action in educational settings, have a background in science, and would like to pursue a PhD in Teaching and Learning, with a focus on science and environmental education.
