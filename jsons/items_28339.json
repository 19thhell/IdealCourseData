If you are interested in registering for a course at another NYU graduate school, you should first review the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to determine whether the course you are interested has already been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising. If the course is pre-approved, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a Pre-Approved Course\" tab on this page. If the course you are interested in has not been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved\" tab on this page.    A complete list of courses within other NYU divisions, with times and locations, can be found in the NYU Directory of Classes. Students can review the Albert Course Search online. For a list of Law School classes, please go to www.law.nyu.edu .      Eligibility       In order to register for a course at another NYU graduate school, you must have completed your Stern Core requirements or be completing them this semester.    To be eligible to graduate, MBA candidates may not complete more than 15.0 credits outside of Stern. This includes courses taken as part of a study abroad exchange program, courses taken as a visiting student, and courses taken at another NYU divisions.    Stern does not accept credit for online courses, under any circumstances.    New York University students may not pursue two degrees simultaneously at different schools of the University, unless accepted and enrolled into one of the established dual degree programs.      Dual degree students       Dual degree students must account for credit reductions when determining how many non-Stern credits can be taken.    A Dual degree student must complete a minimum of 45 credits at Stern despite their credit reduction. This reduces their applicable credits outside of Stern by the number required at Stern. For example, a dual degree student who is required to take 51 credits at Stern for their dual degree requirement will be able to apply only 6 credits to the MBA requirement from another NYU Division or from Study Abroad.      Grades    Other NYU Division courses approved by Academic Affairs and Advising to count toward the MBA program will be included in the Stern GPA. A student must receive a passing grade to receive credit toward the MBA for a non-Stern course. After registering for a non-Stern NYU elective, the course will appear on the My Program Progress page under \"Courses Not Credited to MBA.\" After a passing grade has been submitted, the NYU course will be moved under the Elective area.      Specializations    Non-Stern courses do not count towards Specializations, with the exception of the Law and Business , Real Estate and Digital Marketing Specializations.      Credit Equivalency    The assignment of Stern credits is based on the number of hours the course meets, which varies by school and, sometimes, by course. To count as three Stern credits, a course must meet at least 36 hours. To count as 1.5 Stern credits, a course must meet at least 18 hours.      Important Guidelines       Seats in courses at other NYU divisions are not guaranteed .    Students pay tuition for these courses through Stern according to their Stern credit equivalence.    It is the student's responsibility to be aware of the add/drop dates and deadlines for any approved courses taken outside of the Stern School of Business . Students must contact the Stern Office of Records and Registration to drop a course at another NYU division.    Non-Stern courses are added during the drop/add period and are not included in the lottery selection .                Registering for a Pre-Approved Course   Once you have reviewed the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to confirm that the course you are interested in has been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, please complete the following procedure to register:       Complete the online request form through the Other NYU Division Courses site . For pre-approved courses, students do NOT need to include a course description or syllabus.    Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.                   Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved   Note: Non-Stern courses must be at the Masters degree level, must address a business or management subject that is not covered by Stern electives, and must fit clearly into the student's MBA program. Language and undergraduate courses never qualify. It is the student's responsibility to verify course expectations directly with the other NYU division. Students should confirm their ability to handle the coursework before submitting their request.    Online courses are not permitted to count towards the MBA program requirements and will not be approved.      To request approval of a course that does not appear on the pre-approved list:    1) Complete the online form through our Other NYU Division Courses site at least two weeks prior to the first class meeting. (Petitions submitted any later may not be reviewed.)    The following information must be included in the petition (petitions will only be reviewed upon receipt of all below items):       Course description    Syllabus with meeting times, lecture topics and deliverables    A detailed explanation of how the course will enhance or complement the student's academic program and their \"education in possible\"      2) Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Requests will be reviewed by the appropriate advisors and Stern faculty. When submitting a petition, please keep in mind that the Stern faculty has already reviewed and approved courses which they feel are appropriate for Stern MBA students and have included them in the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course list. Students are advised to make sure that the subject matter is not covered in an existing Stern class.    All students registering for courses at the School of Law that are not pre-approved must also fill out the following form and take it to the School of Law and Academic Affairs and Advising for faculty and administrative signatures.    3) Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.

Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees. Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty \u2013 and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.     The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder\u2019s vision, is \u201cin and of the city\u201d: the University \u2013 which has no walls and no gates \u2013 is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.     In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also located in Brooklyn with the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.     And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi \u2013 the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university \u2013 and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.        NYU Mission Statement   Great cities are engines of creativity, and New York University takes its name and spirit from one of the busiest, most diverse and dynamic cities of all. The University lives within New York and other great cities, from Abu Dhabi to Shanghai, Paris to Prague, Sydney to Buenos Aires\u2014all magnets for talented, ambitious people.   Thriving beyond borders and across academic disciplines, NYU has emerged as one of the most networked and extensive worldwide platform for learning, teaching, researching, building knowledge, and inventing new ways to meet humanity\u2019s challenges. Its students, faculty and alumni feed off the stimulating power of swirling intellectual and cultural experiences by mastering academic disciplines, expressing themselves in the arts, and excelling in demanding professions.   New York University\u2019s mission is to be a top quality international center of scholarship, teaching and research. This involves retaining and attracting outstanding faculty who are leaders in their fields, encouraging them to create programs that draw outstanding students, and providing an intellectually rich environment. NYU seeks to take academic and cultural advantage of its location and to embrace diversity among faculty, staff and students to ensure a wide range of perspectives, including international perspectives, in the educational experience.                                          Message From the President Under President Sexton's administration, the University has moved forward from being an institution that is \"in and of the city,\" to being one that is in and of the world.

If you are interested in registering for a course at another NYU graduate school, you should first review the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to determine whether the course you are interested has already been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising. If the course is pre-approved, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a Pre-Approved Course\" tab on this page. If the course you are interested in has not been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, you should follow the procedure listed under the \"Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved\" tab on this page.    A complete list of courses within other NYU divisions, with times and locations, can be found in the NYU Directory of Classes. Students can review the Albert Course Search online. For a list of Law School classes, please go to www.law.nyu.edu .      Eligibility       In order to register for a course at another NYU graduate school, you must have completed your Stern Core requirements or be completing them this semester.    To be eligible to graduate, MBA candidates may not complete more than 15.0 credits outside of Stern. This includes courses taken as part of a study abroad exchange program, courses taken as a visiting student, and courses taken at another NYU divisions.    Stern does not accept credit for online courses, under any circumstances.    New York University students may not pursue two degrees simultaneously at different schools of the University, unless accepted and enrolled into one of the established dual degree programs.      Dual degree students       Dual degree students must account for credit reductions when determining how many non-Stern credits can be taken.    A Dual degree student must complete a minimum of 45 credits at Stern despite their credit reduction. This reduces their applicable credits outside of Stern by the number required at Stern. For example, a dual degree student who is required to take 51 credits at Stern for their dual degree requirement will be able to apply only 6 credits to the MBA requirement from another NYU Division or from Study Abroad.      Grades    Other NYU Division courses approved by Academic Affairs and Advising to count toward the MBA program will be included in the Stern GPA. A student must receive a passing grade to receive credit toward the MBA for a non-Stern course. After registering for a non-Stern NYU elective, the course will appear on the My Program Progress page under \"Courses Not Credited to MBA.\" After a passing grade has been submitted, the NYU course will be moved under the Elective area.      Specializations    Non-Stern courses do not count towards Specializations, with the exception of the Law and Business , Real Estate and Digital Marketing Specializations.      Credit Equivalency    The assignment of Stern credits is based on the number of hours the course meets, which varies by school and, sometimes, by course. To count as three Stern credits, a course must meet at least 36 hours. To count as 1.5 Stern credits, a course must meet at least 18 hours.      Important Guidelines       Seats in courses at other NYU divisions are not guaranteed .    Students pay tuition for these courses through Stern according to their Stern credit equivalence.    It is the student's responsibility to be aware of the add/drop dates and deadlines for any approved courses taken outside of the Stern School of Business . Students must contact the Stern Office of Records and Registration to drop a course at another NYU division.    Non-Stern courses are added during the drop/add period and are not included in the lottery selection .                Registering for a Pre-Approved Course   Once you have reviewed the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course List to confirm that the course you are interested in has been pre-approved by Academic Affairs and Advising, please complete the following procedure to register:       Complete the online request form through the Other NYU Division Courses site . For pre-approved courses, students do NOT need to include a course description or syllabus.    Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.                   Registering for a course that is not Pre-Approved   Note: Non-Stern courses must be at the Masters degree level, must address a business or management subject that is not covered by Stern electives, and must fit clearly into the student's MBA program. Language and undergraduate courses never qualify. It is the student's responsibility to verify course expectations directly with the other NYU division. Students should confirm their ability to handle the coursework before submitting their request.    Online courses are not permitted to count towards the MBA program requirements and will not be approved.      To request approval of a course that does not appear on the pre-approved list:    1) Complete the online form through our Other NYU Division Courses site at least two weeks prior to the first class meeting. (Petitions submitted any later may not be reviewed.)    The following information must be included in the petition (petitions will only be reviewed upon receipt of all below items):       Course description    Syllabus with meeting times, lecture topics and deliverables    A detailed explanation of how the course will enhance or complement the student's academic program and their \"education in possible\"      2) Academic Affairs and Advising will review and process the request. If approved, you will need to determine the availability in the course directly with the NYU division and, if necessary, receive approval from the other NYU division to register for the course. You should then send an email confirmation of the availability/approval to crossregistrn.list@stern.nyu.edu .    Requests will be reviewed by the appropriate advisors and Stern faculty. When submitting a petition, please keep in mind that the Stern faculty has already reviewed and approved courses which they feel are appropriate for Stern MBA students and have included them in the Non-Stern Pre-Approved Course list. Students are advised to make sure that the subject matter is not covered in an existing Stern class.    All students registering for courses at the School of Law that are not pre-approved must also fill out the following form and take it to the School of Law and Academic Affairs and Advising for faculty and administrative signatures.    3) Once approval has been issued by Stern and the other NYU division, the Office of Records and Registration will register the student and send a confirmation email.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also located in Brooklyn with the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.     And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi \u2013 the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university \u2013 and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.
