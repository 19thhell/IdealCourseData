Description       How does the telling transform a story? And how can a story govern its own telling? In this course for writers of fiction and nonfiction, we consider diverse storytelling strategies, looking at fiction, creative nonfiction and narrative poetry, as well as a few short films. Through exercises in both prose and poetry, we explore how a writer reimagines a project via formal decisions about voice, genre, point of view, diction, even meter and rhyme. The intent is to move us away from comfort zones, to help us draw invention from the unfamiliar and to broaden our literary palettes, so students should be prepared to be daring, open-minded and seriously playful. (Please note that while this is not a workshop in the conventional sense, the instructor will be available during office hours to discuss personal creative projects at the student\u2019s request.) Readings will include works by Amy Hempel, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Vikram Seth, Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Nicholson Baker, Robert Frost, David Foster Wallace, Marjane Satrapi, David Shields and others; also films by Su Friedrich, Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger.

Several foreign language editions are in print, and a film is currently in development from Warner Brothers Pictures. Professor King's poetry has appeared in The\u00a0 Paris Review \u00a0, among other venues, and his criticism in The Village Voice. An essay, \"BOOM,\" most recently appeared in Nuovi Argomenti, in a translation by the Italian poet Massimo Gezzi. Professor King's interests center on art, language, and the imagination, with a special curiosity about work that reinvents form, crosses genres, or bridges apparently disparate modes of the creative process; he is interested in translation for related reasons. Among other awards, King is a Fellow in Literature of the American Academy in Rome.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     Dave King             Part-time Faculty              davekingwriter@gmail.com             1 Wash Pl, Room 505             (212) 998-7363      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours                 Wednesday 4-6                                                       Courses                                                   2015             Spring                            The Shape of the Story: Content into Form                  Wed      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2015             Fall                            Fiction Writing                  Wed      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2014             Spring                            Fiction Writing                  Wed      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2013             Fall                            Advanced Fiction Writing                  Wed      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                                   2012             Fall                            The Shape of the Story: Content into Form                  Wed      6:20 PM -      9:00 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       fiction and poetry; writing, rhetoric and translation; art and art history; film and film history; folklore; politics                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

Description       How does the telling transform a story? And how can a story govern its own telling? In this course for writers of fiction and nonfiction, we consider diverse storytelling strategies, looking at fiction, creative nonfiction and narrative poetry, as well as a few short films. Through exercises in both prose and poetry, we explore how a writer reimagines a project via formal decisions about voice, genre, point of view, diction, even meter and rhyme. The intent is to move us away from comfort zones, to help us draw invention from the unfamiliar and to broaden our literary palettes, so students should be prepared to be daring, open-minded and seriously playful. (Please note that while this is not a workshop in the conventional sense, the instructor will be available during office hours to discuss personal creative projects at the student\u2019s request.) Readings will include works by Amy Hempel, Ryszard Kapuscinski, Vikram Seth, Vladimir Nabokov, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Nicholson Baker, Robert Frost, David Foster Wallace, Marjane Satrapi, David Shields and others; also films by Su Friedrich, Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger.
