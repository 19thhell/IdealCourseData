The research published online in the journal Nature could lead to a better understanding of how oxytocin and other hormones can treat behavioral problems resulting from disease or trauma to the brain. \u201cOur findings redefine oxytocin as something completely different from a \u2018love drug,\u2019 but more as an amplifier and suppressor of neural signals in the brain,\u201d explains study senior investigator Robert Froemke, PhD . Read more\u2026   Medical Marijuana Extract Curbs Seizure Frequency in Early Trial of Epilepsy Patients   A new study led by NYULMC epilepsy specialists shows that some children and adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy may benefit from a treatment regimen including cannabidiol, a compound in medical marijuana that does not contain psychoactive properties. In a multi-site study led by principal investigator Orrin Devinsky, MD , researchers saw over a 50 percent reduction in frequency of certain types of seizures in some patients taking the cannabidiol. The findings will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology\u2019s 67th Annual Meeting.

The research published online in the journal Nature could lead to a better understanding of how oxytocin and other hormones can treat behavioral problems resulting from disease or trauma to the brain. \u201cOur findings redefine oxytocin as something completely different from a \u2018love drug,\u2019 but more as an amplifier and suppressor of neural signals in the brain,\u201d explains study senior investigator Robert Froemke, PhD .

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.
