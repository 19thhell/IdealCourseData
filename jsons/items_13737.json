Mathematics, Cornell University                               Research               Most of my research incorporates the development of fast    high-order analysis-based algorithms into problems in    computational physics, integral equations, singular    quadrature, statistics, and in general, computational    science. Almost all problems are rooted in engineering and    real-world applications.       For more information, check out my   research page .            Integral equations, computational physics, fast    algorithms, and numerical analysis       Almost all partial differential equation occurring in    classical mathematical physics can be reformulated as    integral equations with an appropriate Green's    function. Proper integral formulations are usually very    stable, but result in large dense systems which require fast    algorithms to solve. Over the last couple decades, the    development of analysis-based algorithms such as fast    multipole methods, butterfly algorithms, etc. has enabled    these systems to be solved rapidly, usually in near-linear    time. I have recently been working on particular problems in    electromagnetics, acoustics, and magnetohydrodynamics.         The numerical solution of any of these problems via an   integral method requires solving problems in mathematical   analysis, numerical analysis (e.g. quadrature for singular   integrals), geometry (e.g. well-conditioned triangulations   and meshes), fast computational algorithms, and other niches   of applied mathematics. The resulting codes are often long   and complicated but very efficient.         Complementary to solving PDEs or integral equations,    algorithms which stably and rapidly compute special    functions, invert matrices, apply operators, etc. must be    developed. These schemes fall broadly under numerical    analysis, and constitute the components that go into    necessary software toolboxes for applied mathematics.           Computational statistics       Recently it has been observed that many of the fast    analysis-based algorithms used throughout engineering    physics have direct applications in statistics, machine    learning, and data analysis. In particular, methods for    rapidly inverting structured dense covariance matrices have    immediately found applications in Gaussian processes.
