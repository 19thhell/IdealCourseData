The major includes four core courses:       Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100), an introductory environmental science course    Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101, or ENVST-UA 9101 offered at NYU Berlin), an introductory environment and society course    Internship in Environmental Studies (ENVST-UA 800, or NODEP-UA 9981 offered at NYU Washington, D.C.), taken during the junior year    Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar (ENVST-UA 900), taken during the senior year      Students can choose one of two tracks in the major: Environmental Science or Environmental Values and Society.      Environmental Science Track    To complete a major in Environmental Studies in the Environmental Science track, students must satisfy the following requirements: Receive a C or better in the following four core courses (16 points):    Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100) Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101, or ENVST-UA 9101 offered at NYU Berlin) Internship in Environmental Studies (ENVST-UA 800, or NODEP-UA 9981 offered at NYU Washington, D.C.) Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar (ENVST-UA 900)          Complete the specific requirements for the Environmental Science track. To complete this track, students must satisfy the following three requirements: Receive a C or better in three electives (12 points) on the environmental science distribution list (see below). Only one of these can be at the 200 level. Receive a C or better in one elective (3 or 4 points) on the environmental values and society distribution list (see below) Satisfy the requirements for a minor in one of the following subjects: biology (environmental biology, genetics, molecular and cell biology, or genomics and bioinformatics), chemistry, physics, mathematics, psychology, computer science, computer applications, or computer science and mathematics. A major in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, computer science and mathematics, economics and mathematics, neural science, psychology, or biochemistry will also count as fulfilling this requirement.                                Environmental Values and Society Track   To complete a major in Environmental Studies in the Environmental Values and Society track, students must satisfy the following requirements:      Receive a grade of C or better in the following four core courses (16 points):                Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100)     Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101, or ENVST-UA 9101 offered at NYU Berlin)     Internship in Environmental Studies (ENVST-UA 800, or NODEP-UA 9981 offered at NYU Washington, D.C.)

To complete this track, students must satisfy the following three requirements:        Receive a C or better in three electives (typically 12 points) on the environmental values and society distribution list (see below)     Receive a C or better in one elective (4 points) on the environmental science distribution list (see below)     Satisfy the requirements for a minor in one of the following subjects: anthropology, business studies, economic policy, economic theory, history, metropolitan studies, philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology, and studio art. A major in anthropology, economics, history, journalism, metropolitan studies, philosophy, politics, psychology, and sociology will also count as fulfilling this requirement.              Please note that requirements for majors and minors may change. A course cannot satisfy more than one requirement for the Environmental Studies major.

The major includes four core courses:       Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100), an introductory environmental science course    Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101, or ENVST-UA 9101 offered at NYU Berlin), an introductory environment and society course    Internship in Environmental Studies (ENVST-UA 800, or NODEP-UA 9981 offered at NYU Washington, D.C.), taken during the junior year    Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar (ENVST-UA 900), taken during the senior year      Students can choose one of two tracks in the major: Environmental Science or Environmental Values and Society.      Environmental Science Track    To complete a major in Environmental Studies in the Environmental Science track, students must satisfy the following requirements: Receive a C or better in the following four core courses (16 points):    Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100) Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101, or ENVST-UA 9101 offered at NYU Berlin) Internship in Environmental Studies (ENVST-UA 800, or NODEP-UA 9981 offered at NYU Washington, D.C.) Environmental Studies Capstone Seminar (ENVST-UA 900)          Complete the specific requirements for the Environmental Science track. To complete this track, students must satisfy the following three requirements: Receive a C or better in three electives (12 points) on the environmental science distribution list (see below). Only one of these can be at the 200 level. Receive a C or better in one elective (3 or 4 points) on the environmental values and society distribution list (see below) Satisfy the requirements for a minor in one of the following subjects: biology (environmental biology, genetics, molecular and cell biology, or genomics and bioinformatics), chemistry, physics, mathematics, psychology, computer science, computer applications, or computer science and mathematics. A major in biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, computer science, computer science and mathematics, economics and mathematics, neural science, psychology, or biochemistry will also count as fulfilling this requirement.                                Environmental Values and Society Track   To complete a major in Environmental Studies in the Environmental Values and Society track, students must satisfy the following requirements:      Receive a grade of C or better in the following four core courses (16 points):                Environmental Systems Science (ENVST-UA 100)     Environment and Society (ENVST-UA 101, or ENVST-UA 9101 offered at NYU Berlin)     Internship in Environmental Studies (ENVST-UA 800, or NODEP-UA 9981 offered at NYU Washington, D.C.)
