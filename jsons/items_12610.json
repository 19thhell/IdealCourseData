It is performed after the age of six and is coordinated with the surgical reconstruction of the external ear. It is important that the first stages of external ear reconstruction be performed prior to reconstruction of the ear canal.   At What Age is the External Ear Reconstruction Initiated?   This depends on the patient's size and maturity but generally occurs after the age of six years.   How Many Stages Are Required to Reconstruct An Ear?   The outer ear reconstruction usually involves 3-4 stages. In the first stagea cartilage framework is carved from pieces of rib cartilage and inserted under the skin on the side of the head where the new ear will be. This procedure takes approximately four hours and requires a general anesthetic and a two day hospital stay. The second, third, and fourth stages are short, \"touch-up\" type procedures which, in some patients, can be performed on an outpatient basis. Because of the patient's age they usually require a general anesthetic, but in older patients can be performed under local anesthesia. In the second stage the earlobe is rotated into the correct position. The third stage involves deepening of the conchal bowl (the central part of the ear) and construction of the tragus. In the final stage a skin graft is inserted behind the car to lift it off the head so that it more closely resembles a normal ear.
