Sociologists study the ways that social structures and interactions shape human life. We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples and small groups, to social organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to communities, cities, and nations.    Our methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Indeed, diversity in its subject matter and its methods of research is one of sociology's most distinguishing features. Because sociologists study social interaction in a broad array of contexts, we use whatever method is appropriate for the particular question being posed.    Sociological ideas and methods are used by policy makers, political analysts, and social critics. Many of our concepts have become a part of our common culture and everyday language. Concepts such as \"the self-fulfilling prophecy,\" \"conspicuous consumption,\" \"WASP,\" \"social mobility,\" \"modernization,\" and \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" were all originally coined by sociologists.    Similarly, sociologists were studying important topics such as social inequality, race relations, gender discrimination, and sexual diversity long before these became issues of concern among policy makers and in popular culture. Many modern research techniques, such as polling and survey design, were also pioneered by sociologists.    NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the diversity of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a wide range of subjects, including crime, law, and deviance; sex, gender, and the family; organizations, occupations, and work; immigration; justice; science, politics, social protest, and social policy; power and inequality in modern societies; welfare, culture, and education;and social theory. The faculty also uses a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conducting research.    Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in the social sciences, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them. Those planning a professional career or graduate study in sociology or another social science will find a wide range of useful and interesting courses. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, public administration, and other professional areas can choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research and policy making will benefit from courses that teach practical skills of data gathering and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a variety of perspectives.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Race, \"Difference,\" and Social Inequality      ANTH-UA 323 Identical to SCA-UA 323. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Khan. 4 points.   Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.    Reimagining Community: Race, Nation, and the Politics of Belonging    ANTH-UA 325 Identical to SCA-UA 200. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor.

Examines ways of theorizing gender and violence, including performative ideas of gender. The creation of gender violence as a social problem is a product of social movements in the United States, Europe, India, and many other parts of the world. It is now understood globally as an important human rights violation. Also examines the forms of intervention that have been developed in the United States and globally for diminishing violence against women, including policing, prosecution, and punishment.    Human Rights and Culture    ANTH-UA 331 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Merry. 4 points.   Offers an overview of the human rights system, looking at its basic elements and studying how it works. Focuses on the relationships between human rights and culture. Human rights campaigns frequently encounter resistance in the name of protecting cultural differences. This is particularly common with issues concerning women, children, and the family. Explores several issues that raise questions of human rights and culture, such as female genital cutting, honor killing, trafficking of persons, and indigenous peoples' rights to culture. Using these examples, considers how the human rights system deals with tensions between global standards and local ways of life. Examines the meanings of rights and of culture in these debates and shows the implications of adopting an anthropological analysis of these situations. The goal of the course is developing an understanding of human rights in practice.    Body, Gender, and Belief in China    ANTH-UA 350 Identical to RELST-UA 350.

Discusses changing roles of nation-states and the growing significance of transnational, diasporic, and globalized social relations and cultural forms.    Culture Through Food    ANTH-UA 410 Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or permission of the instructor. Abercrombie, Rogers. 4 points.   Explores some of the ways that people use food, cuisines, and eating to organize and engage with social worlds. This focus provides a concrete means for deepening our understanding of alternative models of social explanation. Drawing on ethnographic material from a wide range of cultures, as well as feature films and our own observations and interviews, we consider topics such as the material dimensions of food production, distribution, and consumption (e.g., how food scarcity or abundance shapes collective possibilities, expectations, and values; the causes, consequences, forms, and myths of globalization) and the cultural meanings and social distinctions encoded in food practices (e.g., how food is used cross-culturally as a marker of social identity\u2014class, gender, and ethnicity\u2014and as a source of meaning\u2014nostalgia, anxiety, and so on). Formations of Indigeneity ANTH-UA 605 Formerly ANTH-UA 320. Prerequisite: Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1) or equivalent. Offered every other year. 4 points. Through a case study of materials concerning indigenous people in Australia and North America, this course will investigate the consequences (cultural, sociological, policy) of a development that has taken place throughout the world. Many of the peoples in whom anthropologists have long been interested\u2013those organized into small-scale societies, kinship based\u2013have been encapsulated as indigenous minorities within nation states dominated by other cultural traditions. In this context, the capacity and practices of these peoples, who some have characterized as \u201cFourth World peoples,\u201d to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms has been limited, undermined, co-opted and, on occasion, ironically reinforced.      Roma in East Central Europe   ANTH-UA 9200 Offered at NYU Prague. 4 points.   Introduces students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority to the emergence of Romany organizations, with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

Between the end of the Ice Age and the expansion of the Roman Empire, temperate Europe witnessed a series of social and economic transformations that represented a transition from a hunting and gathering way of life to urban chiefdoms. Along the way, these hunter-gatherers became agriculturalists and stockherders, learned to use metals, and developed social structures as complex as any found in Old World civilizations. Examines changes in later prehistoric Europe from about 8000 B.C.E. to the arrival of the Romans.    African Archaeology    ANTH-UA 218 Prerequisite: Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3). Tryon. 4 points.   With the longest record of human occupation in the world and a landmass that represents more than one-fifth the habitable area of the globe, Africa plays a central role in our understanding of human evolution, the prehistory of our species, and the development of complex societies. Explores the experiences of ancient human populations in Africa using evidence drawn from archaeology as well as history, ethnography, linguistics, art history, geography, geology, paleontology, biology, and other disciplines. Focuses not only on the material evidence from across the continent and its interpretation, but also an understanding of the major questions, developing methods of inquiry and problem solving, and situating the African data in the broader context of the archaeological evidence for the evolution of human behavioral diversity. The scope of the course spans hominin origins, the study of Stone Age foragers of the first 2.5 million years of human prehistory, and more recent periods characterized by food production, metallurgy, sedentism, and the development of complex societies (e.g., in Egypt, Mali, Zimbabwe, and the East African coast) with influence and contacts across and outside the continent.    Discovering Archaeology in New York City    ANTH-UA 225 Wright. 4 points.   In this course, New York City is our archaeological site. The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage.

Why do some primates live in large social groups while others are solitary and yet others live in pairs or cooperatively breeding families? Why are strong social hierarchies seen in some primate taxa but not in others? How do multiple species of primates often manage to coexist in the same habitat? Why are social relationships in some primate species characterized by strong bonds among females while such bonds are absent in other primate societies? Why do some species of primates show marked geographic variability in behavior and social structure? The answers to these and other questions lie in understanding the relationships between each species and its ecological and social setting and in understanding each species' phylogenetic history. Explores the diversity of primate social systems and the evolutionary relationships among the primates and discusses many of the general ecological laws that have been proposed by evolutionary biologists as the keys to understanding important features of primate behavior and ecology.

Sociologists study the ways that social structures and interactions shape human life. We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples and small groups, to social organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to communities, cities, and nations.    Our methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Indeed, diversity in its subject matter and its methods of research is one of sociology's most distinguishing features. Because sociologists study social interaction in a broad array of contexts, we use whatever method is appropriate for the particular question being posed.    Sociological ideas and methods are used by policy makers, political analysts, and social critics. Many of our concepts have become a part of our common culture and everyday language. Concepts such as \"the self-fulfilling prophecy,\" \"conspicuous consumption,\" \"WASP,\" \"social mobility,\" \"modernization,\" and \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" were all originally coined by sociologists.    Similarly, sociologists were studying important topics such as social inequality, race relations, gender discrimination, and sexual diversity long before these became issues of concern among policy makers and in popular culture. Many modern research techniques, such as polling and survey design, were also pioneered by sociologists.    NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the diversity of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a wide range of subjects, including crime, law, and deviance; sex, gender, and the family; organizations, occupations, and work; immigration; justice; science, politics, social protest, and social policy; power and inequality in modern societies; welfare, culture, and education;and social theory. The faculty also uses a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conducting research.    Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in the social sciences, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them. Those planning a professional career or graduate study in sociology or another social science will find a wide range of useful and interesting courses. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, public administration, and other professional areas can choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research and policy making will benefit from courses that teach practical skills of data gathering and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a variety of perspectives.

Human beings have always grappled with some notion of identity, asking questions about who they are, about who others distinguished from themselves are, and about the ways that perceived similarities and differences are meaningful and important (or not) in social relationships. Examines how historical, social, and cultural contexts shape the forms that identities take, looking in particular at ideas about race and racial identity. We work with two premises: (1) race must be understood in relation to other identity categories: gender, class, sexuality, ethnicity, and so on, and (2) race is expressed in both obvious and subtle ways; thus, racial identity is implicit as well as explicitly expressed. We also consider whether race must necessarily be understood as stigma; discuss nonfiction, fiction, and films; and may visit public exhibitions.

The period covered is from 10,000 years ago to the beginning of the 20th century and is based on archaeological remains. Its history is both fascinating and mind-expanding as a different perspective on the city emerges in time and space from what is learned. Walking around its various boroughs, students learn that our modern landscape is vastly different from that of earlier eras. Along with our gains as a major cultural center, we will assess some losses brought about by the destruction of aspects of the city\u2019s past. In particular, students come to understand the meaning of stewardship in the context of urban development. At the same time, viewing our place in the city\u2019s 10,000 years of history gives us a deeper sense of time and place and a unity in its shared heritage.

Surveys the comparative anatomy of the living primates from a structural, functional, and evolutionary perspective. Different anatomical systems and behaviors are explored, including external features, the cranium, dentition and dietary behavior, postcranial anatomy and locomotor behavior, sensory and nervous systems, and reproductive anatomy. The role of comparative anatomy in taxonomy, behavioral studies, and phylogenetic analyses is emphasized. Primate Communication ANTH-UA 57 Identical to ANST-UA 257. Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2). Offered periodically. 4 points. Increased   social and communicative complexity is one of the defining features of   humans compared to other mammals. Key insights into the evolution of   human communication can come from studying our most closely related   extant relatives, our fellow members of the Primate order. The present   course features a mixture of lectures and discussion classes to consider   contemporary topics in primate (including human) communication. Topics   covered include definitions of communication and consideration of its   major theoretical issues such as the difference between signals and   cues, signal honesty, and concepts of signal information content and   evolutionary signal design. Sections of the class focus on communication   in different sensory modalities\u2014olfactory, auditory, and visual, as   well as multimodal communication\u2014before discussing theories and issues   related to the evolution of language. The class finishes by considering   some of the most contemporary topics in primate communication.    Emerging Diseases    ANTH-UA 80 Disotell, Harrison. 4 points.   Integrates evolutionary biology, genetics, immunology, ecology, and behavioral ecology, along with sociocultural anthropology, politics, and economics, to better understand newly emerging and reemerging diseases as they affect human health. General evolutionary theory and an introduction to Darwinian medicine are provided before the course examines viral, bacterial, parasitic, and prion-based diseases along with their hosts, vectors, and other organisms. Particular attention is paid to how humans have purposely and inadvertently created both biological and cultural environments for the transmission of different diseases. Media representations and misrepresentations are examined throughout the course.    Human Ecology    ANTH-UA 90 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. Crabtree. 4 points.   Investigates the degree to which variation in human biology and culture can be understood as adaptations to varying external conditions. Examines the relationship of human systems of action and the natural world to understand the various forms of human adaptation. Case studies of several living peoples, contemporary and past biological communities, and prehistoric cultures provide the material for interpretation and evaluation of theoretical positions.    Evolution of Language    ANTH-UA 240 Prerequisite: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) or permission of the instructor. 4 points.   Explores the various hypotheses offered for the evolution of language. Perspectives from different disciplines are discussed. Topics include human evolution and the study of fossil humans, animal and primate behavior and communication, anatomy of the vocal tract, neuroanatomy, language acquisition, language universals, the origins and diversification of modern languages, and the origins of writing.    Introduction to Forensic Anthropology    ANTH-UA 326 Ant\u00f3n, Williams. 4 points.   Biological anthropology examines the evolutionary history and adaptability of humans and our ancestors. Forensic anthropology is an applied subfield of biological anthropology that provides expert analysis of the skeleton in a medicolegal setting by utilizing methods developed in skeletal biology, archaeology, and the forensic sciences. Forensic anthropologists play critical roles in identifying victims of mass fatalities (such as the World Trade Center and Oklahoma City bombings), in investigating homicides (such as identifying the Russian tsar's family), and in distinguishing cause of death. The course examines how forensic anthropologists approach modern and historic crimes in the laboratory and the field. Students are introduced to the underlying theory and the applied techniques that forensic anthropologists use to recover and identify individuals and assess cause of death.    Topical Seminar in Biological Anthropology I, II    ANTH-UA 511, 512 Open to majors in anthropology with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies or the instructor. Ant\u00f3n, Bailey, Disotell, Harrison, Higham, Williams. 4 points per term.   Explores selected key issues and problems in biological anthropology, theoretically and methodologically.
