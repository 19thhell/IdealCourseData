But, unless you say that other group members have permission to write to the file, they cannot make modifications, they'll only be able to read the file.   You can use your Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) program to change permissions on a file.

You'll see a panel displaying the active permissions for the selected file.

This allows hundreds of members of the NYU community to develop and maintain content for NYU Web; you and your colleagues may even have been put into a Web permissions group so you can share file access to content in your Web directory.   UNIX allows you to designate, on a file-by-file basis, who has permission to read the file and and/or write to the file. This is known as setting file permissions. When you upload a file, you become the owner of that file and it is assigned (usually) to the default permissions group that you are in. But, unless you say that other group members have permission to write to the file, they cannot make modifications, they\u2019ll only be able to read the file.            Reading UNIX permissions   The line below is an example of what file permissions look like on the web server.   -rwxr--r-- username groupname 546 Dec 10 13:10 filename         Column Description   -rwxr--r-- This first character (-) designates what type of entry it is. If it is a file , the first character will be a &quot;-&quot; and the entry will look like this: -rwxr--r-- . If it is a directory , the first character will be a d and the entry will look like this: drwxr--r--  rwx The 1st three slots are the permissions for the owner of the file. The r means the owner can read the file; the w means the owner can write to the file; and the x means the owner can (e) xecute the file. The x bit, e.g., the execute option, is usually only set when the file is a script or when permissions are set for a directory. If a script is not executable, it cannot run. If a directory is not executable, it cannot be opened or seen by the web browser.  r-- The 2nd three slots are the permissions for the group . In this case, the group members can read the file ( r ) but not write it or execute it.  r-- The last 3 slots are the permissions for the world . In order to have your pages visible by people viewing through a web browser, you need this set to &quot;readable.&quot;  username This is the owner of the file. Your NetID will appear in this space.  groupname This is the name of the web permissions group to which this file belongs. Your web permissions group name will appear in this space. The NYU Web Team will assign a web permissions group name when we create your account. Those working on sites alone will not be in a web permissions group and need not worry about group permissions. The default web permissions group is &quot;users&quot;. You will be placed in this group when your account is created.  546 This is the file's size in bytes. 546 bytes is roughly equal to .5 Kilobytes (K). 1 Megabyte (MB) is equal to 1024K.  Dec 10 13:10 This is the last modification date of the file.  filename This is the name of the file.            Modifying UNIX Permissions   When you upload a file to the web server, the permissions are set by default so that the owner of the file can read and write to the file, the group and world can only read it (-rw-r--r--). If you're working with a web permissions group, then your default permissions should be set so that both you as the owner of the file and the group with whom you're working will be able to write to the file (-rw-rw-r-).   If you find that this is not the case, you will need to log into the server (using SSH), go to the specific web directory in which the file(s) resides (see UNIX navigation commands), and use specific UNIX commands to change the file(s) permissions.   First, list the contents of the directory, by using the ls -lag command which will allow you to see file permissions, owners and groups. For example:   i4% ls -lag  total 18  drwxrwxr-x 2  aqe123 users   6 Sep 10 17:43 .  drwxrwxr-x 26 aqe123 users   122 Sep 2 17:58 ..  -rw-r--r--  1 aqe123 webedit  19 Sep 10 17:43 .htaccess  -rw-r--r--  1 aqe123 webedit 16209 Sep 10 17:43 address.html  -rw-r--r--  1 aqe123 webedit  887 Sep 10 17:30 examples.html   Here, the file owner is NetID aqe123 . The group ownership belongs to the group called webedit . The files, however, are not set correctly for group permissions. Therefore, we must change them appropriately.   1. Changing Permissions on Everything Inside a Directory Except Subdirectories   The command:   chmod 664 *.*         Column Description   chmod means &quot;change mode&quot;  644 a number combination that will set the permissions correctly so that both owner and group can read and write to the file(s).  *.* means all files that contain a period before the file extension (for example, this would affect files with a . html or . jpg suffix). This character combination will omit directories and files such as .htaccess .      Once the chmod command is executed, the file's permissions will be changed. To check, use the ls -lag command again:   i4% ls -lag  total 18  drwxrwxr-x  2  aqe123  users   6 Sep 10 17:43 .  drwxrwxr-x 26  aqe123  users  122 Sep 2 17:58 ..  -rw-r--r--  1  aqe123 webedit  19 Sep 10 17:43 .htaccess  -rw-r--r--  1  aqe123 webedit 16209 Sep 10 17:43 address.html  -rw-r--r--  1  aqe123 webedit  887 Sep 10 17:30 examples.html   Note the changes to the first column - the permissions have been changed from rw-r--r-- to rw-rw-r-- .          2. Modifying Directory Permissions   The command:   chmod 775 directoryname   will allow the directory to be accessed by both its owner and the group . But remember, you cannot be inside of the directory whose permissions you are trying to change. You must be one directory above it to make any changes.     3. Modifying Permissions on Every File and Subdirectory   You can use the following command:   chmod -R g+w directoryname   to execute permission changes on every file and subdirectory contained within a main directory. Use the -R flag to indicate a recursive change.   This means change the permissions mode recursively so that all files and subdirectories within directoryname are readable and writeable by the permissions group.     4. Modifying Group Permissions   If you find that some of your files or directories are not owned by the correct web permissions group (for example, they were created with the default &quot;users&quot; group), you can change the group ownership ( as long as you own the file/directory) using the chgrp command . The command chgrp means &quot;change group&quot;.   For example:   chgrp \u2013R group directoryname   This means change the group permissions recursively so that all files and subdirectories are owned by the group called group within the directory directoryname (where directoryname is the name of the directory in which you wish to change all the group ownership permissions and group is your correct web permissions group).   You can also change group permissions on individual files:   chgrp group file.html   where group above is your correct web permissions group and file.html is the file for which you want to change group permissions.   In case you are interested, the following chart shows how we get the numbers 664 and 775 that were used in the previous examples. You just add up the numbers of the settings you want:         Code Description   0400 Allow read by the owner.  0200 Allow write by the owner.  0100 Allow execute by the owner.    0700 Allow read, write, and execute search by the owner.    0040 Allow read by group members.  0020 Allow write by group members.  0010 Allow execute by group members.  0070 Allow read, write, and execute by group members.  0004 Allow read by others (the &quot;world&quot;).    0002 Allow write by others.  0001 Allow execute by others.    0007 Allow read, write, and execute by others.        So, for example:   664 =         the + 0400 allow read by owner  + 0200 allow write by the owner  + 0040 allow read by group members  + 0020 allow write by group members  + 0004 allow read by others   = 664      and:   775 =         + 0400 allow read by the owner  + 0200 allow write by the owner  + 0100 allow execute by the owner  + 0040 allow read by group members  + 0020 allow write by group members  + 0010 allow execute by group members  + 0004 allow read by others  + 0001 allow execute by others   = 775                      Need Assistance?
