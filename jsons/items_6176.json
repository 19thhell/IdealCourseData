Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.            Comments (0)                                         Tips for Avoiding Plagiarism                   Make your own ideas the focus of your paper.       Use the ideas of others to reinforce your own argument, and give the original author credit by citing the source.       Keep track of complete citation information whenever you take notes and while you are writing your paper. Unintentional plagiarism can result from sloppy research or from careless \"cutting and pasting\" of online sources.       Make it a habit to regularly use EasyBib to keep track of every source you find. Better yet, learn how to use RefWorks to not only format your citations but also provide you with an online file cabinet of your research sources.       Any words, ideas, opinions, or original research that are not your own must be cited. This is true whether you copy material word-for-word or if you summarize a passage and change a few words around. Use quotation marks when you directly state another person's words.           Common knowledge, established facts, and well-known proverbs do not need to be cited. None of these sentences needs a citation:     Albany is the capital of New York.   Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   Look before you leap.

When you are writing a paper, you must cite your sources in order to:     avoid plagiarism   acknowledge the author of ideas and words other than your own   enable readers of your paper to re-locate your source     If you need writing help, the Academic Resource Center is an excellent resource for NYU students.

Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list . Below are two examples of formatted citations.   A complete list of examples in MLA and other styles is found on the library's Bibliographic and Footnote Style Guide .

What Every Student Should Know about Avoiding Plagiarism - Linda Stern Call Number: PN167 .S74 2007 ISBN: 0321446895 Publication Date: 2006-06-13 This book teaches students to take plagiarism seriously, to understand its consequences, and how to avoid it. This invaluable guide offers instruction and models for how to summarize, paraphrase, and quote sources. The most common types of plagiarism are discussed, from simple mistakes such as forgetting to use the quotation marks when using someone else's exact words or failing to acknowledge another's thoughts and ideas, to wholesale fraudulence, such as purchasing student papers from online sites and claiming them as one's own work. A brief guide to citing sources in both MLA and APA styles is also included.   The Bedford handbook - Diana Hacker Call Number: PE1408 .H277 2010 Non-circulating Built on Diana Hacker\u2019s vision and developed with the help of expert composition teachers, The Bedford Handbook is the indispensable classroom and reference tool it always was \u2014 only better. Now with the strongest coverage of research writing in a full-sized handbook, the seventh edition helps students meet one of the core challenges of academic writing: maintaining their own voice while writing from sources.

Example Topic: How are the concepts of liberalism and equality discussed in the scholarship by Fishkin ?      What are the key components of our topic?   1. liberalism   2. equality   3. Fishkin      What some synonyms are there for these concepts? Are there general words that could be used to describe these terms?     equity, equality, liberty       political philosophy       justice, fairness       left, leftism             Comments (0)                                         Example Search Strategy                 If we put together all of our search techniques with the keywords we brainstormed, here are two search strategies that we might use:         \"James Fishkin\" and liberal*     (liberal* and equal*) and \"James Fishkin\"       liberal* and family and equality             Comments (0)                                         Using Boolean Operators                 Getting Started With Boolean   Using Boolean operators -- AND, OR, NOT -- is a great way to further refine your searches.           Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

Use the ideas of others to reinforce your own argument, and give the original author credit by citing the source.       Keep track of complete citation information whenever you take notes and while you are writing your paper. Unintentional plagiarism can result from sloppy research or from careless \"cutting and pasting\" of online sources.       Make it a habit to regularly use EasyBib to keep track of every source you find. Better yet, learn how to use RefWorks to not only format your citations but also provide you with an online file cabinet of your research sources.       Any words, ideas, opinions, or original research that are not your own must be cited. This is true whether you copy material word-for-word or if you summarize a passage and change a few words around. Use quotation marks when you directly state another person's words.           Common knowledge, established facts, and well-known proverbs do not need to be cited. None of these sentences needs a citation:     Albany is the capital of New York.   Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   Look before you leap.

When you are writing a paper, you must cite your sources in order to:     avoid plagiarism   acknowledge the author of ideas and words other than your own   enable readers of your paper to re-locate your source     If you need writing help, the Academic Resource Center is an excellent resource for NYU students.

Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list . Below are two examples of formatted citations.   A complete list of examples in MLA and other styles is found on the library's Bibliographic and Footnote Style Guide .

What Every Student Should Know about Avoiding Plagiarism - Linda Stern Call Number: PN167 .S74 2007 ISBN: 0321446895 Publication Date: 2006-06-13 This book teaches students to take plagiarism seriously, to understand its consequences, and how to avoid it. This invaluable guide offers instruction and models for how to summarize, paraphrase, and quote sources. The most common types of plagiarism are discussed, from simple mistakes such as forgetting to use the quotation marks when using someone else's exact words or failing to acknowledge another's thoughts and ideas, to wholesale fraudulence, such as purchasing student papers from online sites and claiming them as one's own work. A brief guide to citing sources in both MLA and APA styles is also included.

Example Topic: How are the concepts of liberalism and equality discussed in the scholarship by Fishkin ?      What are the key components of our topic?   1. liberalism   2. equality   3. Fishkin      What some synonyms are there for these concepts? Are there general words that could be used to describe these terms?     equity, equality, liberty       political philosophy       justice, fairness       left, leftism             Comments (0)                                         Example Search Strategy                 If we put together all of our search techniques with the keywords we brainstormed, here are two search strategies that we might use:         \"James Fishkin\" and liberal*     (liberal* and equal*) and \"James Fishkin\"       liberal* and family and equality             Comments (0)                                         Using Boolean Operators                 Getting Started With Boolean   Using Boolean operators -- AND, OR, NOT -- is a great way to further refine your searches.           Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

When you are writing a paper or doing research on a topic, you must cite your sources. Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list. There are many reasons why citing your sources is important, and you must cite them in order to avoid plagiarism . There are various styles for citing sources; you will most likely find that you will need to use one style if you are writing a paper for a literature course and a different style if you are working in the sciences or social sciences.   How to use this guide :   Using the tabs near the top of this page, you should select the citation style appropriate for your field of study. In each tab, there are some basic examples of items you might be citing. For further examples or more detailed assistance, you may need to refer to a complete writing and style guide. Go to the More Style and Writing Guides tab for more information.   Citation management systems, like RefWorks or Endnote, are extremely useful for keeping track of, organizing, formatting, and sharing your reference lists. Go to the Formatting Tools tab for more information.   If you have questions about how to cite your sources or what style you should use, remember that you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, advisor, or a librarian. Good luck!   What Is Plagiarism?   Why Should You Cite Your Sources?   When Should You Cite Your Sources?           Comments (0)                                         What Is Plagiarism?                  Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.            Comments (0)                                         Why Should You Cite Your Sources?                 All scholarly or academic work requires  that you cite your sources, whether you are writing a long paper or a quick report. Why is citing your research so important?   Researching and writing a paper ideally involves a process of exploring and learning. By citing your sources, you are showing your reader how you came to your conclusions and acknowledging the other people's work that brought you to your conclusions. Citing your sources      Documents your research and   scholarship    Acknowledges the work of others   whose scholarship contributed to your work    Helps your reader understand   the context of your argument    Provides information for your   reader to use to locate additional information on your topic    Establishes the credibility of   your scholarship   Provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your own integrity and understanding of academic ethics        Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Sometimes your professor or your discipline will have specific requirements about when and how to cite your sources. However, these are some guidelines that generally apply.    Always cite your sources when:       You quote verbatim from someone else's work.    You summarize or paraphrase someone else's work.    You are conveying information which may be unfamiliar to your reader (e.g. statistics or factual data).    You are not sure whether or not you need to cite. As mentioned above, when in doubt, err on the side of caution. It is better to give your reader more information rather than less .       Remember, if you have a question about whether or not you need to cite your source, you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help. Sometimes citing your sources takes a little bit of time and effort, but it is worth it to avoid plagiarism.    Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Choosing between the two often depends on subject matter and   nature of sources cited, as each system is favored by different groups   of scholars. If you are unsure what system you should use for your paper, please ask your professor, teaching assistant, or publisher which you should follow.   The humanities style is preferred by many in literature, history, and   the arts. This style presents bibliographic information in notes and,   often, a bibliography. It accommodates a variety of sources, including   esoteric ones less appropriate to the author-date system.   The more concise author-date system has long been used by those in the   physical, natural, and social sciences. In this system, sources are briefly   cited in the text, usually in parentheses, by author&rsquo;s last name   and date of publication. The short citations are amplified in a list   of references, where full bibliographic information is provided.   You must choose to use either the notes and bibliography system ([N] and [B] below) or the author-date system ([T] and [R] below). Do not mix the two systems. Again, ask your professor if you are unsure which is preferred.

Is the author or publisher associated with a special-interest group, such as Greenpeace or the National Rifle Association, that might present only one side of an issue?   Are alternative views presented and addressed? How fairly does the author treat opposing views?   Does the author&rsquo;s language show signs of bias?     Assessing an argument       What is the author&rsquo;s central claim or thesis?   How does the author support this claim&mdash;with relevant and sufficient evidence or with just a few anecdotes or emotional examples?   Are statistics consistent with those you encounter in other sources? Have they been used fairly? Does the author explain where the statistics come from? (It is possible to &ldquo;lie&rdquo; with statistics by using them selectively or by omitting mathematical details.)   Are any of the author&rsquo;s assumptions questionable?   Does the author consider opposing arguments and refute them persuasively?   Does the author fall prey to any logical fallacies?      Evaluating Web sources   Authorship       Does the Web site or document have an author? You may need to do some clicking and scrolling to find the author&rsquo;s name. If you have landed directly on an internal page of a site, for example, you may need to navigate to the home page or find an &ldquo;about this site&rdquo; link to learn the name of the author.   If there is an author, can you tell whether he or she is knowledgeable and credible? When the author&rsquo;s qualifications aren&rsquo;t listed on the site itself, look for links to the author&rsquo;s home page, which may provide evidence of his or her interests and expertise.     Sponsorship       Who, if anyone, sponsors the site? The sponsor of a site is often named and described on the home page.   What does the URL tell you? The domain name extension often indicates the type of group hosting the site: commercial (.com), educational (.edu), nonprofit (.org), governmental (.gov), military (.mil), or network (.net). URLs may also indicate a country of origin: .uk (United Kingdom) or .jp (Japan), for instance.     Purpose and audience       Why was the site created: To argue a position? To sell a product? To inform readers?   Who is the site&rsquo;s intended audience?     Currency       How current is the site? Check for the date of publication or the latest update, often located at the bottom of the home page or at the beginning or end of an internal page.   How current are the site&rsquo;s links? If many of the links no longer work, the site may be too dated for your purposes.       Hacker, Diana and Barbara Fister. Research and Documentation . Bedford / St. Martin's, 2011.

I. A COMMUNITY OF THE MIND   The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any community, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him/her of an education. Most importantly, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. Thus, when students enter the College, one of the first things that they are asked to do is to sign a community compact, recognizing these principles of academic integrity. For this reason also, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness.   \" Nothing is more basic to living and working together than trust. Without it, as Thomas Hobbes warned, humanity is reduced to a &lsquo;war of all against all.' Trust is the condition of cooperation and of social relationships themselves. We learn as children not to be naively trusting, but instead to watch to see which people and which organizations deserve to be trusted. We are disappointed all too often. Law courts and religions try to make people more trustworthy. But being the sort of person who can be trusted is still a personal achievement. Trust does not depend on people putting aside their personal benefits, but on people pursuing them in ways that make them dependable partners to others. Thus lovers try to be faithful and friends loyal. Even in competition, trustworthiness is important. Not only are there punishments for those who cheat, but today's competitor may readily become tomorrow's colleague. An institution like a college depends enormously on trust. Students rightly expect professors to teach honestly and not deceive them. Society trusts scientists not to lie about the results of their research. Neither the pursuit of new knowledge nor the effort to preserve and pass on old wisdom can flourish unless we can trust each other to be intellectually honest. \" &mdash;Craig Calhoun, University Professor of the Social Sciences   II. SOME GUIDELINES   Academic honesty means that the work you submit - in whatever form - is original. Students are expected - often required - to build their work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped you is expected; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft. Obviously, bringing answers into an examination or copying all or part of a paper straight from a book, the Internet, or a fellow student is a violation of this principle. But there are other forms of cheating or plagiarizing which are just as serious, for example:     presenting an oral report drawn without attribution from other sources (oral or written);   writing a paragraph which, despite being in different words, expresses someone else's idea without a reference to the source of the idea;   submitting essentially the same paper in two different courses (unless both instructors have given their permission in advance);   giving or receiving help on a take-home examination or quiz unless expressly permitted by the instructor (as in collaborative projects)   presenting as your own a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;   presenting as your own facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;   submitting another student's work with your name on it;   purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill;   \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.     Term paper mills (web sites and businesses set up to sell papers to students) often claim they are merely offering \"information\" or \"research\" to students and that this service is acceptable and allowed throughout the university. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. If you buy and submit \"research,\" drafts, summaries, abstracts, or final versions of a paper, you are committing plagiarism and are subject to stringent disciplinary action. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact and not intention, it is crucial that you acknowledge every source accurately and completely. If you quote anything from a source, use quotation marks and take down the page number of the quotation to use in your footnote.   When in doubt about whether your acknowledgment is proper and adequate, consult your instructor. Show the instructor your sources and a draft of the paper in which you are using them. The obligation to demonstrate that work is your own rests with you, the student. You are responsible for providing sources, copies of your work, or verification of the date work was completed. While all this looks like a lot to remember, all you need to do is to give credit where it is due, take credit only for your original ideas, and ask your instructor or adviser when in doubt.   Consult the APA, MLA, or Chicago style guides for accepted forms of documentation. You can access these resources, as well as additional information on proper citations on the NYU Libraries Citation Style Guide .   III. PROCEDURES AND SANCTIONS   The penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. The following are the procedures as approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science. See also the College Bulletin .     If a student cheats on an examination or in laboratory work or engages in plagia-rism, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken. The Department can take the following actions: a) The faculty member, with the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Director), may reduce the student's grade or give the student an F in the course.  b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the department believes a more severe penalty (i.e., probation, suspension, expulsion) is warranted, it can refer the case to the Dean or his/her representative (Associate Dean for Students) for further action.   In all cases of either (a) or (b), the Director shall inform the Department Chair of any action in writing and send copies of this letter to the Dean and to the student. The letter shall include the nature of the offense, the penalty, and the right of the student to appeal such penalty. A copy of the letter shall be kept in a confidential chairman's file and not in the student's departmental file. The Dean's office copy shall also be kept in a confidential file. (The Professor and/or the Director is encouraged to meet with the student and discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken.)   For cases involving a first offense at New York University, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semester suspension, or a more severe penalty. (The student is also called in to discuss the offense, and review the consequences of the disciplinary action.)   For cases involving a second offense, the Dean shall proceed as follows:  a) Upon receiving a second Director's letter concerning a given student, the Dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from the department involved, to examine the evidence. This ad hoc committee shall consider if there are reasonable grounds to believe that cheating/plagiarism has occurred and if so, shall affirm the suspension penalty. It shall report its conclusion to the Dean within three business days.  b) If the committee affirms the suspension, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail the suspension letter within two business days of receiving the report. The letter shall advise the student of his or her right to appeal. The student shall have two business days from the letter's delivery to request an appeal of the suspension as provided in Section 5 (below). The suspension shall ordinarily be stayed during the pendency of appeal.  c ) If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shall be kept on file for a one-year period.   The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the Dean. In the event of an appeal, the Dean shall elicit a written complaint from the faculty member and proceed as described above.

Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.            Comments (0)                                         Tips for Avoiding Plagiarism                   Make your own ideas the focus of your paper.       Use the ideas of others to reinforce your own argument, and give the original author credit by citing the source.       Keep track of complete citation information whenever you take notes and while you are writing your paper. Unintentional plagiarism can result from sloppy research or from careless \"cutting and pasting\" of online sources.       Make it a habit to regularly use EasyBib to keep track of every source you find. Better yet, learn how to use RefWorks to not only format your citations but also provide you with an online file cabinet of your research sources.       Any words, ideas, opinions, or original research that are not your own must be cited. This is true whether you copy material word-for-word or if you summarize a passage and change a few words around. Use quotation marks when you directly state another person's words.           Common knowledge, established facts, and well-known proverbs do not need to be cited. None of these sentences needs a citation:     Albany is the capital of New York.   Water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.   Look before you leap.

This invaluable guide offers instruction and models for how to summarize, paraphrase, and quote sources. The most common types of plagiarism are discussed, from simple mistakes such as forgetting to use the quotation marks when using someone else's exact words or failing to acknowledge another's thoughts and ideas, to wholesale fraudulence, such as purchasing student papers from online sites and claiming them as one's own work. A brief guide to citing sources in both MLA and APA styles is also included.

Boolean Operator       Search Example       Retrieves             AND     A good way to limit/refine your search.   Decreases your results.       rivers AND salinity     Retrieves articles that contain both the words river and salinity.                 OR     A good way to expand your search   Useful if you have synonyms that you would like to search for.   Increases your results.           fruit OR vegetables       Returns articles that contain either the word fruits or vegetables .           Not     A good way to limit your search   Allows you to exclude terms from your search results       fruit NOT apples   Returns articles that contain the word fruits but do not contain the word apples .             Advanced Boolean: Putting It All Together   In the above examples, we showed the use of boolean operators with 2 search terms; however, you can join any number of terms with boolean operators.   Parentheses! In the examples below, you'll notice that we use parentheses to group search terms and operators. The parentheses tell the search engine how to read your search statement. Remember when you learned about order of operations in math and using parentheses? Same concept.           Search Example       Retrieves           Europe AND dairy products AND export   Articles that contain all of the following words: dairy products, Europe, and export.         canoeing AND (kayaking OR sculling)   Articles that contain the both of the words canoeing and sculling ; also brings back articles that contain both of the words canoeing and kayaking.         South America AND (puma OR panther) NOT Brazil   Articles that contain the terms South America and Puma ; articles that contain the terms South America and Panther . Will not bring back articles with the term Brazil .                   Comments (0)                                         Advanced Searching Techniques                 Most databases support these techniques, but sometimes the syntax or symbol used varies. If in doubt, check the Help section of the database.           Search Technique       Symbol       Example       Retrieves           Phrase Searching   Useful when you have a string of words that must appear next to each other in your search statement.       Most search engines use quotation marks around phrases.   &ldquo;mad cow disease&rdquo;   Articles where the exact phrase \"mad cow disease\" is present.         Truncation   Allows you to search for variant endings of a word. Remember that when you search, the database is looking for an exact match for your term so using truncation can increase the flexibility of your search.        Most databases use the asterisk however, some use a different symbol. Most notably, LexisNexis uses the exclamation point.   parent*   Articles with any of the following words: parent, parents, parenting, parental         Wildcards   Allows you to search for different variants of a word where the difference may be within the word as opposed to at the end of the word. This technique is most useful when searching for plurals that do not use an \"s\" (ex. woman vs. women) or when searching for articles in which there may be slightly different British spelling (ex. color vs. colour)       Some databases use the asterisk ; others use the question mark . Check the help section to determine which symbol is use.   wom*n   Articles that contain either the word woman or women.

When you are writing a paper or doing research on a topic, you must cite your sources. Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list. There are many reasons why citing your sources is important, and you must cite them in order to avoid plagiarism . There are various styles for citing sources; you will most likely find that you will need to use one style if you are writing a paper for a literature course and a different style if you are working in the sciences or social sciences.   How to use this guide :   Using the tabs near the top of this page, you should select the citation style appropriate for your field of study. In each tab, there are some basic examples of items you might be citing. For further examples or more detailed assistance, you may need to refer to a complete writing and style guide. Go to the More Style and Writing Guides tab for more information.   Citation management systems, like RefWorks or Endnote, are extremely useful for keeping track of, organizing, formatting, and sharing your reference lists. Go to the Formatting Tools tab for more information.   If you have questions about how to cite your sources or what style you should use, remember that you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, advisor, or a librarian. Good luck!   What Is Plagiarism?   Why Should You Cite Your Sources?   When Should You Cite Your Sources?           Comments (0)                                         What Is Plagiarism?                  Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.            Comments (0)                                         Why Should You Cite Your Sources?                 All scholarly or academic work requires  that you cite your sources, whether you are writing a long paper or a quick report. Why is citing your research so important?   Researching and writing a paper ideally involves a process of exploring and learning. By citing your sources, you are showing your reader how you came to your conclusions and acknowledging the other people's work that brought you to your conclusions. Citing your sources      Documents your research and   scholarship    Acknowledges the work of others   whose scholarship contributed to your work    Helps your reader understand   the context of your argument    Provides information for your   reader to use to locate additional information on your topic    Establishes the credibility of   your scholarship   Provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your own integrity and understanding of academic ethics        Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Sometimes your professor or your discipline will have specific requirements about when and how to cite your sources. However, these are some guidelines that generally apply.    Always cite your sources when:       You quote verbatim from someone else's work.    You summarize or paraphrase someone else's work.    You are conveying information which may be unfamiliar to your reader (e.g. statistics or factual data).    You are not sure whether or not you need to cite. As mentioned above, when in doubt, err on the side of caution. It is better to give your reader more information rather than less .       Remember, if you have a question about whether or not you need to cite your source, you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help. Sometimes citing your sources takes a little bit of time and effort, but it is worth it to avoid plagiarism.    Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Choosing between the two often depends on subject matter and   nature of sources cited, as each system is favored by different groups   of scholars. If you are unsure what system you should use for your paper, please ask your professor, teaching assistant, or publisher which you should follow.   The humanities style is preferred by many in literature, history, and   the arts. This style presents bibliographic information in notes and,   often, a bibliography. It accommodates a variety of sources, including   esoteric ones less appropriate to the author-date system.   The more concise author-date system has long been used by those in the   physical, natural, and social sciences. In this system, sources are briefly   cited in the text, usually in parentheses, by author&rsquo;s last name   and date of publication. The short citations are amplified in a list   of references, where full bibliographic information is provided.   You must choose to use either the notes and bibliography system ([N] and [B] below) or the author-date system ([T] and [R] below). Do not mix the two systems. Again, ask your professor if you are unsure which is preferred.

Is the author or publisher associated with a special-interest group, such as Greenpeace or the National Rifle Association, that might present only one side of an issue?   Are alternative views presented and addressed? How fairly does the author treat opposing views?   Does the author&rsquo;s language show signs of bias?     Assessing an argument       What is the author&rsquo;s central claim or thesis?   How does the author support this claim&mdash;with relevant and sufficient evidence or with just a few anecdotes or emotional examples?   Are statistics consistent with those you encounter in other sources? Have they been used fairly? Does the author explain where the statistics come from? (It is possible to &ldquo;lie&rdquo; with statistics by using them selectively or by omitting mathematical details.)   Are any of the author&rsquo;s assumptions questionable?   Does the author consider opposing arguments and refute them persuasively?   Does the author fall prey to any logical fallacies?      Evaluating Web sources   Authorship       Does the Web site or document have an author? You may need to do some clicking and scrolling to find the author&rsquo;s name. If you have landed directly on an internal page of a site, for example, you may need to navigate to the home page or find an &ldquo;about this site&rdquo; link to learn the name of the author.   If there is an author, can you tell whether he or she is knowledgeable and credible? When the author&rsquo;s qualifications aren&rsquo;t listed on the site itself, look for links to the author&rsquo;s home page, which may provide evidence of his or her interests and expertise.     Sponsorship       Who, if anyone, sponsors the site? The sponsor of a site is often named and described on the home page.   What does the URL tell you? The domain name extension often indicates the type of group hosting the site: commercial (.com), educational (.edu), nonprofit (.org), governmental (.gov), military (.mil), or network (.net). URLs may also indicate a country of origin: .uk (United Kingdom) or .jp (Japan), for instance.     Purpose and audience       Why was the site created: To argue a position? To sell a product? To inform readers?   Who is the site&rsquo;s intended audience?     Currency       How current is the site? Check for the date of publication or the latest update, often located at the bottom of the home page or at the beginning or end of an internal page.   How current are the site&rsquo;s links? If many of the links no longer work, the site may be too dated for your purposes.       Hacker, Diana and Barbara Fister. Research and Documentation . Bedford / St. Martin's, 2011.

Because RefWorks is web-based, you can use it from any Internet-connected computer/device on campus or off.  EndNote NYU has a campus-wide license to this software, which you download (at no cost to you) to your laptop or desktop computer. (The software includes a less developed web-based component called EndNoteWeb.) EasyBib A Web-based service that offers two versions: free and premium The free version is a citation generator only (can't save and organize citations), covers 3 citation styles, and contains advertising. The premium version -- paid for by NYU -- generates citations, covers 9 citation styles, saves and organizes citations, features virtual notecards and dynamic outlining, and does not contain advertising. Zotero A free download that works with your web browser. There are two options: Zotero for Firefox is a Firefox-specific extension that offers the full range of functionality. Zotero Standalone -- a separate browser-independent application that can be used with Chrome, Safari, or Opera -- offers slightly less functionality than the Firefox extension.

I. A COMMUNITY OF THE MIND   The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any community, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him/her of an education. Most importantly, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. Thus, when students enter the College, one of the first things that they are asked to do is to sign a community compact, recognizing these principles of academic integrity. For this reason also, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness.   \" Nothing is more basic to living and working together than trust. Without it, as Thomas Hobbes warned, humanity is reduced to a &lsquo;war of all against all.' Trust is the condition of cooperation and of social relationships themselves. We learn as children not to be naively trusting, but instead to watch to see which people and which organizations deserve to be trusted. We are disappointed all too often. Law courts and religions try to make people more trustworthy. But being the sort of person who can be trusted is still a personal achievement. Trust does not depend on people putting aside their personal benefits, but on people pursuing them in ways that make them dependable partners to others. Thus lovers try to be faithful and friends loyal. Even in competition, trustworthiness is important. Not only are there punishments for those who cheat, but today's competitor may readily become tomorrow's colleague. An institution like a college depends enormously on trust. Students rightly expect professors to teach honestly and not deceive them. Society trusts scientists not to lie about the results of their research. Neither the pursuit of new knowledge nor the effort to preserve and pass on old wisdom can flourish unless we can trust each other to be intellectually honest. \" &mdash;Craig Calhoun, University Professor of the Social Sciences   II. SOME GUIDELINES   Academic honesty means that the work you submit - in whatever form - is original. Students are expected - often required - to build their work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped you is expected; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft. Obviously, bringing answers into an examination or copying all or part of a paper straight from a book, the Internet, or a fellow student is a violation of this principle. But there are other forms of cheating or plagiarizing which are just as serious, for example:     presenting an oral report drawn without attribution from other sources (oral or written);   writing a paragraph which, despite being in different words, expresses someone else's idea without a reference to the source of the idea;   submitting essentially the same paper in two different courses (unless both instructors have given their permission in advance);   giving or receiving help on a take-home examination or quiz unless expressly permitted by the instructor (as in collaborative projects)   presenting as your own a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;   presenting as your own facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;   submitting another student's work with your name on it;   purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill;   \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.     Term paper mills (web sites and businesses set up to sell papers to students) often claim they are merely offering \"information\" or \"research\" to students and that this service is acceptable and allowed throughout the university. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. If you buy and submit \"research,\" drafts, summaries, abstracts, or final versions of a paper, you are committing plagiarism and are subject to stringent disciplinary action. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact and not intention, it is crucial that you acknowledge every source accurately and completely. If you quote anything from a source, use quotation marks and take down the page number of the quotation to use in your footnote.   When in doubt about whether your acknowledgment is proper and adequate, consult your instructor. Show the instructor your sources and a draft of the paper in which you are using them. The obligation to demonstrate that work is your own rests with you, the student. You are responsible for providing sources, copies of your work, or verification of the date work was completed. While all this looks like a lot to remember, all you need to do is to give credit where it is due, take credit only for your original ideas, and ask your instructor or adviser when in doubt.   Consult the APA, MLA, or Chicago style guides for accepted forms of documentation. You can access these resources, as well as additional information on proper citations on the NYU Libraries Citation Style Guide .   III. PROCEDURES AND SANCTIONS   The penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. The following are the procedures as approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science. See also the College Bulletin .     If a student cheats on an examination or in laboratory work or engages in plagia-rism, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken. The Department can take the following actions: a) The faculty member, with the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Director), may reduce the student's grade or give the student an F in the course.  b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the department believes a more severe penalty (i.e., probation, suspension, expulsion) is warranted, it can refer the case to the Dean or his/her representative (Associate Dean for Students) for further action.   In all cases of either (a) or (b), the Director shall inform the Department Chair of any action in writing and send copies of this letter to the Dean and to the student. The letter shall include the nature of the offense, the penalty, and the right of the student to appeal such penalty. A copy of the letter shall be kept in a confidential chairman's file and not in the student's departmental file. The Dean's office copy shall also be kept in a confidential file. (The Professor and/or the Director is encouraged to meet with the student and discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken.)   For cases involving a first offense at New York University, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semester suspension, or a more severe penalty. (The student is also called in to discuss the offense, and review the consequences of the disciplinary action.)   For cases involving a second offense, the Dean shall proceed as follows:  a) Upon receiving a second Director's letter concerning a given student, the Dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from the department involved, to examine the evidence. This ad hoc committee shall consider if there are reasonable grounds to believe that cheating/plagiarism has occurred and if so, shall affirm the suspension penalty. It shall report its conclusion to the Dean within three business days.  b) If the committee affirms the suspension, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail the suspension letter within two business days of receiving the report. The letter shall advise the student of his or her right to appeal. The student shall have two business days from the letter's delivery to request an appeal of the suspension as provided in Section 5 (below). The suspension shall ordinarily be stayed during the pendency of appeal.  c ) If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shall be kept on file for a one-year period.   The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the Dean. In the event of an appeal, the Dean shall elicit a written complaint from the faculty member and proceed as described above.
