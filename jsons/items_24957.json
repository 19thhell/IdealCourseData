Students who qualify for services must have a documented disability that substantially limits a major life activity. To register for services with the Moses Center, a student must provide current documentation of their disability.&amp;nbsp; Documentation must include a specific diagnosis and &amp;nbsp;be conducted by a qualified licensed professional. The nature and severity of the current impairment, information about functional limitations caused by such impairment and the current treatment plan with recommended accommodations must be included.   Different disabilities require different types of information. Refer to our forms page for a list of documentation guidelines sorted by disability.   To self-identify to CSD, all documentation must provide a diagnosis and be provided by a qualified, licensed professional.                                                                Does the Moses Center provide testing for learning disabilities or ADD/ADHD?                               The Moses Center does not provide testing services.&amp;nbsp; We will, however, provide a list of testing centers in the New York area that perform psycho-educational assessments.                                                                Does the Moses Center assist students with temporary impairments?                               Yes. Students with temporary disabilities must follow the same registration and documentation procedures as all other registered students.&amp;nbsp; When appropriate, accommodations are approved on a temporary basis.                                                                How do students request disability-related housing accommodations?                                In accordance with applicable federal, state, and city disability laws, New York University will provide reasonable accommodations for students:     Who have a qualifying physical or psychological impairment and/or a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment (please see the full definition of disability on the bottom of page 1 of the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations ) and   Who are eligible to reside in University housing.     Housing accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis, taking the student\u2019s medically documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations into consideration. The Reasonable Housing Accommodations Review Committee meets bi-monthly to consider student housing accommodation requests. The Committee is comprised of professionals from the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services , the Student Health Center (link), and the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. Students requesting special housing accommodations must complete the Reasonable Housing Accommodation Request packet which includes a form to be completed by a healthcare provider. The completed packet must be submitted to the committee by the appropriate annual/semester deadlines to ensure timely evaluation of housing requests. Late requests may result in an inability to meet your housing accommodations needs. Students must renew their requests for special housing accommodations in conjunction with every housing application period.   Please refer to the Reasonable Housing Accommodations section of the CSD website for instructions on how to apply for a reasonable housing accommodation.                                                              Are there NYU scholarships available for students with disabilities?                               The Moses Center annually provides a limited number of tuition awards made possible by grant funding to registered students with disabilities. Awards are administered in conjunction with the Office of Financial Aid and are based on applicant's financial need, severity of disability, and academic qualifications. Applications are available at the Moses Center beginning in June.                                                                How do I obtain a copy of disability documentation from my Moses Center file?                               Students who need to have a copy of their disability documentation forwarded to another party must complete a signed release. The release form is available in the CSD office at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.                                                                How can the Moses Center help me to obtain test accommodations for professional or certification exams?                               Agencies administering professional exams (i.e. GRE, MCAT, LSAT, GMAT) or certification exams (i.e. NTE, CSW, Bar exam) typically require individuals seeking disability related accommodations to submit current documentation of disability and/or a test packet form completed by the postsecondary institution\u2019s Center for Students with Disabilities. The Moses Center must verify that the documentation of disability on file is current and complete and that the individual has used the requested accommodations while in attendance. Individuals seeking test accommodations approval for such an exam should contact the Moses Center with the appropriate test information and forms.                                                                How do I request accommodations for participation in a New York University Study Abroad Program?                                Students who plan to attend an NYU Study Away program and seek academic or housing accommodations at a particular site should contact the Moses Center to request accommodations. Students must be registered with the Moses Center to be eligible for accommodations whether they are NYU students or students from another institution. The Moses Center will work with the student and the Study Away Program to arrange approved accommodations. Students with disabilities planning to study away are strongly urged to obtain information in advance regarding the specific site\u2019s programs and facilities and to arrange a meeting with a CSD representative to discuss potential barriers.   Some accommodations may be limited at Study Away sites; students are urged to discuss their needs with a disability specialist before accepting a placement in a global program of any duration.   Please refer to the Study Away and Disability section of the CSD website for more information                                                              Is there a special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU?                               There is no special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU, although a student may voluntarily disclose their disability during the admissions process. Please understand that your disability has no impact on the admissions decision.                          Faculty Questions                                                    I have received a letter from CSD listing accommodations for a student. How do I know that the student\u0092s request for accommodations is warranted?                               Federal Law requires reasonable accommodations for students who have a documented disability. In order for a student to be granted accommodations, s/he must submit documentation of a condition which significantly impacts the students\u2019 ability to participate in the educational opportunities at NYU. Experienced disability higher education specialists review the documentation and decide on appropriate accommodations. The documentation on file at the Moses Center is kept current and reviewed periodically with the student to determine appropriate and effective accommodations. You can call the Moses Center (212-998-4980) if you have any questions about the appropriateness of the student\u2019s accommodation request.                                                                What if a student requests an accommodation which I feel is not appropriate for my course?                               If you have a question about a particular accommodation, please call the student\u2019s specialist to discuss your concern. The specialist\u2019s knowledge of the student\u2019s disability related needs and your input about your course requirements will be the foundation for the specialist to make the appropriate decision regarding the accommodation.                                                                What should I do if I suspect that a student may have a disability and might be eligible for accommodations through the Moses Center?                               Disclosure of disability is a sensitive issue for many students. If the student discloses information to you which seems to indicate that a disability might be present, or if the student seems to be having difficulty with coursework or access to university facilities which is related to a more obvious disability, you can encourage the student to contact the Moses Center. The request for accommodations, though, must come from the student. You may consider including a statement on your syllabus about the Moses Center. A sample syllabus statement is below.   Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 for further information.                                                                What if I still have questions regarding disability accommodations?                               Please feel free to call the Moses Center office at any time at 212-998-4980 with questions or concerns regarding students with disabilities at NYU.

Housing accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis, taking the student\u2019s medically documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations into consideration. New York University has established the following procedures to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to New York University\u2019s housing resources.   Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations   Once the NYU housing eligibility requirements are satisfied, download and carefully read the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations . This packet provides important information about the process, including instructions on filling out the Request for Reasonable Housing Accommodations , applicable deadlines and examples and descriptions of common housing accommodation requests.     Download and complete the Request for Reasonable Housing Accommodations. The student and their healthcare provider must complete Parts I and II of the application which must be returned to Moses CSD with the Authorization for Release of Information (Part III) signed by the student. Completed applications can be mailed to:   The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities  726 Broadway, 2nd Floor   New York, NY 10003   ATTN: Reasonable Housing Accommodations   They can also be emailed to mosescsd@nyu.edu or faxed to 212-995-4114. Faxed applications will be reviewed, however, the original documents must be sent by mail. Information provided to the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities is kept confidential and will only be shared within the University as is necessary to evaluate the request.   Your request and supporting documentation will be reviewed by a committee consisting of representatives from the Moses Center, the University Student Health Center, and other administrators having knowledge of the accommodation process. Members include medical and counseling professionals from the Student Health Center and Counseling and Wellness Services. The committee meets bimonthly.     * Please be aware that this process is separate from registering a disability for reasonable academic accommodations. Please click on the \u201cHow to Register\u201d tab for information about registering for reasonable academic accommodations.   ** Because of the varied impact a disability can have on different major life activities, CSD requires separate, specific documentation for each registration process (housing, academic, etc).

Students who qualify for services must have a documented disability that substantially limits a major life activity. To register for services with the Moses Center, a student must provide current documentation of their disability.&amp;nbsp; Documentation must include a specific diagnosis and &amp;nbsp;be conducted by a qualified licensed professional. The nature and severity of the current impairment, information about functional limitations caused by such impairment and the current treatment plan with recommended accommodations must be included.   Different disabilities require different types of information. Refer to our forms page for a list of documentation guidelines sorted by disability.   To self-identify to CSD, all documentation must provide a diagnosis and be provided by a qualified, licensed professional.                                                                Does the Moses Center provide testing for learning disabilities or ADD/ADHD?                               The Moses Center does not provide testing services.&amp;nbsp; We will, however, provide a list of testing centers in the New York area that perform psycho-educational assessments.                                                                Does the Moses Center assist students with temporary impairments?                               Yes. Students with temporary disabilities must follow the same registration and documentation procedures as all other registered students.&amp;nbsp; When appropriate, accommodations are approved on a temporary basis.                                                                How do students request disability-related housing accommodations?                                In accordance with applicable federal, state, and city disability laws, New York University will provide reasonable accommodations for students:     Who have a qualifying physical or psychological impairment and/or a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment (please see the full definition of disability on the bottom of page 1 of the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations ) and   Who are eligible to reside in University housing.     Housing accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis, taking the student\u2019s medically documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations into consideration. The Reasonable Housing Accommodations Review Committee meets bi-monthly to consider student housing accommodation requests. The Committee is comprised of professionals from the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services , the Student Health Center (link), and the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. Students requesting special housing accommodations must complete the Reasonable Housing Accommodation Request packet which includes a form to be completed by a healthcare provider. The completed packet must be submitted to the committee by the appropriate annual/semester deadlines to ensure timely evaluation of housing requests. Late requests may result in an inability to meet your housing accommodations needs. Students must renew their requests for special housing accommodations in conjunction with every housing application period.   Please refer to the Reasonable Housing Accommodations section of the CSD website for instructions on how to apply for a reasonable housing accommodation.                                                              Are there NYU scholarships available for students with disabilities?                               The Moses Center annually provides a limited number of tuition awards made possible by grant funding to registered students with disabilities. Awards are administered in conjunction with the Office of Financial Aid and are based on applicant's financial need, severity of disability, and academic qualifications. Applications are available at the Moses Center beginning in June.                                                                How do I obtain a copy of disability documentation from my Moses Center file?                               Students who need to have a copy of their disability documentation forwarded to another party must complete a signed release. The release form is available in the CSD office at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.                                                                How can the Moses Center help me to obtain test accommodations for professional or certification exams?                               Agencies administering professional exams (i.e. GRE, MCAT, LSAT, GMAT) or certification exams (i.e. NTE, CSW, Bar exam) typically require individuals seeking disability related accommodations to submit current documentation of disability and/or a test packet form completed by the postsecondary institution\u2019s Center for Students with Disabilities. The Moses Center must verify that the documentation of disability on file is current and complete and that the individual has used the requested accommodations while in attendance. Individuals seeking test accommodations approval for such an exam should contact the Moses Center with the appropriate test information and forms.                                                                How do I request accommodations for participation in a New York University Study Abroad Program?                                Students who plan to attend an NYU Study Away program and seek academic or housing accommodations at a particular site should contact the Moses Center to request accommodations. Students must be registered with the Moses Center to be eligible for accommodations whether they are NYU students or students from another institution. The Moses Center will work with the student and the Study Away Program to arrange approved accommodations. Students with disabilities planning to study away are strongly urged to obtain information in advance regarding the specific site\u2019s programs and facilities and to arrange a meeting with a CSD representative to discuss potential barriers.   Some accommodations may be limited at Study Away sites; students are urged to discuss their needs with a disability specialist before accepting a placement in a global program of any duration.   Please refer to the Study Away and Disability section of the CSD website for more information                                                              Is there a special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU?                               There is no special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU, although a student may voluntarily disclose their disability during the admissions process. Please understand that your disability has no impact on the admissions decision.                          Faculty Questions                                                    I have received a letter from CSD listing accommodations for a student. How do I know that the student\u0092s request for accommodations is warranted?                               Federal Law requires reasonable accommodations for students who have a documented disability. In order for a student to be granted accommodations, s/he must submit documentation of a condition which significantly impacts the students\u2019 ability to participate in the educational opportunities at NYU. Experienced disability higher education specialists review the documentation and decide on appropriate accommodations. The documentation on file at the Moses Center is kept current and reviewed periodically with the student to determine appropriate and effective accommodations. You can call the Moses Center (212-998-4980) if you have any questions about the appropriateness of the student\u2019s accommodation request.                                                                What if a student requests an accommodation which I feel is not appropriate for my course?                               If you have a question about a particular accommodation, please call the student\u2019s specialist to discuss your concern. The specialist\u2019s knowledge of the student\u2019s disability related needs and your input about your course requirements will be the foundation for the specialist to make the appropriate decision regarding the accommodation.                                                                What should I do if I suspect that a student may have a disability and might be eligible for accommodations through the Moses Center?                               Disclosure of disability is a sensitive issue for many students. If the student discloses information to you which seems to indicate that a disability might be present, or if the student seems to be having difficulty with coursework or access to university facilities which is related to a more obvious disability, you can encourage the student to contact the Moses Center. The request for accommodations, though, must come from the student. You may consider including a statement on your syllabus about the Moses Center. A sample syllabus statement is below.   Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 for further information.                                                                What if I still have questions regarding disability accommodations?                               Please feel free to call the Moses Center office at any time at 212-998-4980 with questions or concerns regarding students with disabilities at NYU.

Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.

Students who qualify for services must have a documented disability that substantially limits a major life activity. To register for services with the Moses Center, a student must provide current documentation of their disability.&amp;nbsp; Documentation must include a specific diagnosis and &amp;nbsp;be conducted by a qualified licensed professional. The nature and severity of the current impairment, information about functional limitations caused by such impairment and the current treatment plan with recommended accommodations must be included.   Different disabilities require different types of information. Refer to our forms page for a list of documentation guidelines sorted by disability.   To self-identify to CSD, all documentation must provide a diagnosis and be provided by a qualified, licensed professional.                                                                Does the Moses Center provide testing for learning disabilities or ADD/ADHD?                               The Moses Center does not provide testing services.&amp;nbsp; We will, however, provide a list of testing centers in the New York area that perform psycho-educational assessments.                                                                Does the Moses Center assist students with temporary impairments?                               Yes. Students with temporary disabilities must follow the same registration and documentation procedures as all other registered students.&amp;nbsp; When appropriate, accommodations are approved on a temporary basis.                                                                How do students request disability-related housing accommodations?                                In accordance with applicable federal, state, and city disability laws, New York University will provide reasonable accommodations for students:     Who have a qualifying physical or psychological impairment and/or a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment (please see the full definition of disability on the bottom of page 1 of the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations ) and   Who are eligible to reside in University housing.     Housing accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis, taking the student\u2019s medically documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations into consideration. The Reasonable Housing Accommodations Review Committee meets bi-monthly to consider student housing accommodation requests. The Committee is comprised of professionals from the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services , the Student Health Center (link), and the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. Students requesting special housing accommodations must complete the Reasonable Housing Accommodation Request packet which includes a form to be completed by a healthcare provider. The completed packet must be submitted to the committee by the appropriate annual/semester deadlines to ensure timely evaluation of housing requests. Late requests may result in an inability to meet your housing accommodations needs. Students must renew their requests for special housing accommodations in conjunction with every housing application period.   Please refer to the Reasonable Housing Accommodations section of the CSD website for instructions on how to apply for a reasonable housing accommodation.                                                              Are there NYU scholarships available for students with disabilities?                               The Moses Center annually provides a limited number of tuition awards made possible by grant funding to registered students with disabilities. Awards are administered in conjunction with the Office of Financial Aid and are based on applicant's financial need, severity of disability, and academic qualifications. Applications are available at the Moses Center beginning in June.                                                                How do I obtain a copy of disability documentation from my Moses Center file?                               Students who need to have a copy of their disability documentation forwarded to another party must complete a signed release. The release form is available in the CSD office at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.                                                                How can the Moses Center help me to obtain test accommodations for professional or certification exams?                               Agencies administering professional exams (i.e. GRE, MCAT, LSAT, GMAT) or certification exams (i.e. NTE, CSW, Bar exam) typically require individuals seeking disability related accommodations to submit current documentation of disability and/or a test packet form completed by the postsecondary institution\u2019s Center for Students with Disabilities. The Moses Center must verify that the documentation of disability on file is current and complete and that the individual has used the requested accommodations while in attendance. Individuals seeking test accommodations approval for such an exam should contact the Moses Center with the appropriate test information and forms.                                                                How do I request accommodations for participation in a New York University Study Abroad Program?                                Students who plan to attend an NYU Study Away program and seek academic or housing accommodations at a particular site should contact the Moses Center to request accommodations. Students must be registered with the Moses Center to be eligible for accommodations whether they are NYU students or students from another institution. The Moses Center will work with the student and the Study Away Program to arrange approved accommodations. Students with disabilities planning to study away are strongly urged to obtain information in advance regarding the specific site\u2019s programs and facilities and to arrange a meeting with a CSD representative to discuss potential barriers.   Some accommodations may be limited at Study Away sites; students are urged to discuss their needs with a disability specialist before accepting a placement in a global program of any duration.   Please refer to the Study Away and Disability section of the CSD website for more information                                                              Is there a special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU?                               There is no special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU, although a student may voluntarily disclose their disability during the admissions process. Please understand that your disability has no impact on the admissions decision.                          Faculty Questions                                                    I have received a letter from CSD listing accommodations for a student. How do I know that the student\u0092s request for accommodations is warranted?                               Federal Law requires reasonable accommodations for students who have a documented disability. In order for a student to be granted accommodations, s/he must submit documentation of a condition which significantly impacts the students\u2019 ability to participate in the educational opportunities at NYU. Experienced disability higher education specialists review the documentation and decide on appropriate accommodations. The documentation on file at the Moses Center is kept current and reviewed periodically with the student to determine appropriate and effective accommodations. You can call the Moses Center (212-998-4980) if you have any questions about the appropriateness of the student\u2019s accommodation request.                                                                What if a student requests an accommodation which I feel is not appropriate for my course?                               If you have a question about a particular accommodation, please call the student\u2019s specialist to discuss your concern. The specialist\u2019s knowledge of the student\u2019s disability related needs and your input about your course requirements will be the foundation for the specialist to make the appropriate decision regarding the accommodation.                                                                What should I do if I suspect that a student may have a disability and might be eligible for accommodations through the Moses Center?                               Disclosure of disability is a sensitive issue for many students. If the student discloses information to you which seems to indicate that a disability might be present, or if the student seems to be having difficulty with coursework or access to university facilities which is related to a more obvious disability, you can encourage the student to contact the Moses Center. The request for accommodations, though, must come from the student. You may consider including a statement on your syllabus about the Moses Center. A sample syllabus statement is below.   Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 for further information.                                                                What if I still have questions regarding disability accommodations?                               Please feel free to call the Moses Center office at any time at 212-998-4980 with questions or concerns regarding students with disabilities at NYU.

Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations   Once the NYU housing eligibility requirements are satisfied, download and carefully read the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations . This packet provides important information about the process, including instructions on filling out the Request for Reasonable Housing Accommodations , applicable deadlines and examples and descriptions of common housing accommodation requests.     Download and complete the Request for Reasonable Housing Accommodations. The student and their healthcare provider must complete Parts I and II of the application which must be returned to Moses CSD with the Authorization for Release of Information (Part III) signed by the student. Completed applications can be mailed to:   The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities  726 Broadway, 2nd Floor   New York, NY 10003   ATTN: Reasonable Housing Accommodations   They can also be emailed to mosescsd@nyu.edu or faxed to 212-995-4114. Faxed applications will be reviewed, however, the original documents must be sent by mail. Information provided to the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities is kept confidential and will only be shared within the University as is necessary to evaluate the request.   Your request and supporting documentation will be reviewed by a committee consisting of representatives from the Moses Center, the University Student Health Center, and other administrators having knowledge of the accommodation process. Members include medical and counseling professionals from the Student Health Center and Counseling and Wellness Services. The committee meets bimonthly.     * Please be aware that this process is separate from registering a disability for reasonable academic accommodations. Please click on the \u201cHow to Register\u201d tab for information about registering for reasonable academic accommodations.   ** Because of the varied impact a disability can have on different major life activities, CSD requires separate, specific documentation for each registration process (housing, academic, etc).

Reasonable Accommodations are adjustments to policy, practice, and programs that \u201clevel the playing field\u201d for students with disabilities and provide equal access to NYU\u2018s programs and activities. Accommodation plans and other related services are individualized based on each student\u2019s disability-related needs, disability documentation and NYU program requirements and are therefore determined on a case by case basis. Each student who registers with CSD works with a Disability Specialist to develop a reasonable accommodation plan.   Accommodations include, but are not limited to:     Testing accommodations   Note-takers   Use of a computer for exams   Materials in alternate format   Provision of sign language interpreters     Reasonable accommodations do not negate requirements for successful completion of a program, course, or service or adherence to acceptable standards of behavior. It is important to note that some accommodations are not appropriate in all courses.      How to Register with CSD   Students in higher education who wish to receive accommodations must self disclose by registering their disability with CSD. The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD) has established the following process for registration with the office:     Complete an Application for Services form.   Gather and submit current documentation of your disability. To register a learning disability or ADD/ADHD, you must submit a current psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation. If you have a learning disability or ADHD and you do not have a current evaluation and feel unable to secure one, please e-mail mosescsd@nyu.edu and ask for a documentation consultation with a CSD Disability Specialist. For all other disability types, you may submit the CSD Certification of Disability form completed by a qualified health professional/clinician. Please refer to our Disability Documentation Guidelines and choose the one specific to your disability to give to your clinician to use as a guide for completing the Certification of Disability form or psycho-educational or neuro-psychological evaluation.   Submit a signed Authorization for Release of Information form so CSD has your permission to contact your clinician if necessary.   After you have submitted the Application for Services , current disability documentation, and a signed Authorization for Release of Information form, your request for accommodations will be reviewed by a CSD Disability Specialist. You will then be contacted to schedule a meeting to discuss one of the following:     1. Your approved accommodations and how to use the services provided by CSD;  2. The need for additional documentation of your disability;  3. Why you have not been approved for accommodations through CSD.       **Please note that all CSD forms are also available at the Moses Center at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.

Students who qualify for services must have a documented disability that substantially limits a major life activity. To register for services with the Moses Center, a student must provide current documentation of their disability.&amp;nbsp; Documentation must include a specific diagnosis and &amp;nbsp;be conducted by a qualified licensed professional. The nature and severity of the current impairment, information about functional limitations caused by such impairment and the current treatment plan with recommended accommodations must be included.   Different disabilities require different types of information. Refer to our forms page for a list of documentation guidelines sorted by disability.   To self-identify to CSD, all documentation must provide a diagnosis and be provided by a qualified, licensed professional.                                                                Does the Moses Center provide testing for learning disabilities or ADD/ADHD?                               The Moses Center does not provide testing services.&amp;nbsp; We will, however, provide a list of testing centers in the New York area that perform psycho-educational assessments.                                                                Does the Moses Center assist students with temporary impairments?                               Yes. Students with temporary disabilities must follow the same registration and documentation procedures as all other registered students.&amp;nbsp; When appropriate, accommodations are approved on a temporary basis.                                                                How do students request disability-related housing accommodations?                                In accordance with applicable federal, state, and city disability laws, New York University will provide reasonable accommodations for students:     Who have a qualifying physical or psychological impairment and/or a record of such an impairment or is regarded as having such an impairment (please see the full definition of disability on the bottom of page 1 of the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations ) and   Who are eligible to reside in University housing.     Housing accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis, taking the student\u2019s medically documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations into consideration. The Reasonable Housing Accommodations Review Committee meets bi-monthly to consider student housing accommodation requests. The Committee is comprised of professionals from the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services , the Student Health Center (link), and the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities. Students requesting special housing accommodations must complete the Reasonable Housing Accommodation Request packet which includes a form to be completed by a healthcare provider. The completed packet must be submitted to the committee by the appropriate annual/semester deadlines to ensure timely evaluation of housing requests. Late requests may result in an inability to meet your housing accommodations needs. Students must renew their requests for special housing accommodations in conjunction with every housing application period.   Please refer to the Reasonable Housing Accommodations section of the CSD website for instructions on how to apply for a reasonable housing accommodation.                                                              Are there NYU scholarships available for students with disabilities?                               The Moses Center annually provides a limited number of tuition awards made possible by grant funding to registered students with disabilities. Awards are administered in conjunction with the Office of Financial Aid and are based on applicant's financial need, severity of disability, and academic qualifications. Applications are available at the Moses Center beginning in June.                                                                How do I obtain a copy of disability documentation from my Moses Center file?                               Students who need to have a copy of their disability documentation forwarded to another party must complete a signed release. The release form is available in the CSD office at 726 Broadway, 2nd Floor.                                                                How can the Moses Center help me to obtain test accommodations for professional or certification exams?                               Agencies administering professional exams (i.e. GRE, MCAT, LSAT, GMAT) or certification exams (i.e. NTE, CSW, Bar exam) typically require individuals seeking disability related accommodations to submit current documentation of disability and/or a test packet form completed by the postsecondary institution\u2019s Center for Students with Disabilities. The Moses Center must verify that the documentation of disability on file is current and complete and that the individual has used the requested accommodations while in attendance. Individuals seeking test accommodations approval for such an exam should contact the Moses Center with the appropriate test information and forms.                                                                How do I request accommodations for participation in a New York University Study Abroad Program?                                Students who plan to attend an NYU Study Away program and seek academic or housing accommodations at a particular site should contact the Moses Center to request accommodations. Students must be registered with the Moses Center to be eligible for accommodations whether they are NYU students or students from another institution. The Moses Center will work with the student and the Study Away Program to arrange approved accommodations. Students with disabilities planning to study away are strongly urged to obtain information in advance regarding the specific site\u2019s programs and facilities and to arrange a meeting with a CSD representative to discuss potential barriers.   Some accommodations may be limited at Study Away sites; students are urged to discuss their needs with a disability specialist before accepting a placement in a global program of any duration.   Please refer to the Study Away and Disability section of the CSD website for more information                                                              Is there a special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU?                               There is no special application process for students with disabilities applying to NYU, although a student may voluntarily disclose their disability during the admissions process. Please understand that your disability has no impact on the admissions decision.                          Faculty Questions                                                    I have received a letter from CSD listing accommodations for a student. How do I know that the student\u0092s request for accommodations is warranted?                               Federal Law requires reasonable accommodations for students who have a documented disability. In order for a student to be granted accommodations, s/he must submit documentation of a condition which significantly impacts the students\u2019 ability to participate in the educational opportunities at NYU. Experienced disability higher education specialists review the documentation and decide on appropriate accommodations. The documentation on file at the Moses Center is kept current and reviewed periodically with the student to determine appropriate and effective accommodations. You can call the Moses Center (212-998-4980) if you have any questions about the appropriateness of the student\u2019s accommodation request.                                                                What if a student requests an accommodation which I feel is not appropriate for my course?                               If you have a question about a particular accommodation, please call the student\u2019s specialist to discuss your concern. The specialist\u2019s knowledge of the student\u2019s disability related needs and your input about your course requirements will be the foundation for the specialist to make the appropriate decision regarding the accommodation.                                                                What should I do if I suspect that a student may have a disability and might be eligible for accommodations through the Moses Center?                               Disclosure of disability is a sensitive issue for many students. If the student discloses information to you which seems to indicate that a disability might be present, or if the student seems to be having difficulty with coursework or access to university facilities which is related to a more obvious disability, you can encourage the student to contact the Moses Center. The request for accommodations, though, must come from the student. You may consider including a statement on your syllabus about the Moses Center. A sample syllabus statement is below.   Academic accommodations are available for students with documented disabilities. Please contact the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 for further information.                                                                What if I still have questions regarding disability accommodations?                               Please feel free to call the Moses Center office at any time at 212-998-4980 with questions or concerns regarding students with disabilities at NYU.

Housing accommodations are determined on a case-by-case basis, taking the student\u2019s medically documented need and prevailing standards for reasonable accommodations into consideration. New York University has established the following procedures to ensure that students with disabilities have equal access to New York University\u2019s housing resources.   Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations   Once the NYU housing eligibility requirements are satisfied, download and carefully read the Informational Packet for Requesting Reasonable Housing Accommodations . This packet provides important information about the process, including instructions on filling out the Request for Reasonable Housing Accommodations , applicable deadlines and examples and descriptions of common housing accommodation requests.     Download and complete the Request for Reasonable Housing Accommodations. The student and their healthcare provider must complete Parts I and II of the application which must be returned to Moses CSD with the Authorization for Release of Information (Part III) signed by the student. Completed applications can be mailed to:   The Moses Center for Students with Disabilities  726 Broadway, 2nd Floor   New York, NY 10003   ATTN: Reasonable Housing Accommodations   They can also be emailed to mosescsd@nyu.edu or faxed to 212-995-4114. Faxed applications will be reviewed, however, the original documents must be sent by mail. Information provided to the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities is kept confidential and will only be shared within the University as is necessary to evaluate the request.   Your request and supporting documentation will be reviewed by a committee consisting of representatives from the Moses Center, the University Student Health Center, and other administrators having knowledge of the accommodation process. Members include medical and counseling professionals from the Student Health Center and Counseling and Wellness Services. The committee meets bimonthly.     * Please be aware that this process is separate from registering a disability for reasonable academic accommodations. Please click on the \u201cHow to Register\u201d tab for information about registering for reasonable academic accommodations.   ** Because of the varied impact a disability can have on different major life activities, CSD requires separate, specific documentation for each registration process (housing, academic, etc).
