Building on the emergence of urban humanities and urban landscape history, we propose to consider the urban river as a city-making landscape deserving of careful reading and analysis: past, present, and future.   The subject of this symposium builds on a new multi-year initiative in urban landscape studies, which Dumbarton Oaks is launching in 2015 with support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Its principal goal is to create a dialogue between designers and scholars to address the landscape consequences of advancing urbanization. With this task in mind, the 2015 symposium aims to bring together the work of contemporary designers with the historical perspectives of scholars, encouraging practitioners and historians to bridge the gaps between their modes of thinking. We consider historians to include those in art history, urban history, and architectural history among others. We would particularly welcome proposals for collaborative or paired presentations by designers and historians working on similar topics or the same city.   Please submit a 300 word abstract to Thaisa Way by  September 14, 2014 to be considered for the 2015 Dumbarton Oaks Garden and Landscape Studies symposium: \"River Cities: Historical and Contemporary.\" If accepted, full papers will be due on March 1, 2015 for presentation in May 2015 (most likely May 8-9, 2015).

What has become of the many cases of crisisbe it art, art  history, the museum, the market, etc.which have been proclaimed  during the last decade. Is the idea of the artistic crisis, as a moment of radical change within an individual career, a topos from the  historiography of romantic and modernist art, still useful today? Does  the notion of political or economic crisis help to understand changes  in the realm of art? And can the practice of art criticism and its  normative criteria of value and quality, which during the 20th century  got separated from the academic practice of art historiography, inspire  the methodology of the discipline as a whole?   Proposals from all geographical and temporal areas of art history and  related disciplines, which reflect on the theoretical potential or the  concepts of critique and crisis, are welcome.   These three documents will be sent by e-mail [by 1st October 2014 ] to the following address:    barbara.biedermann@ikg.unibe.ch .  1) A proposal for communication, not exceeding 1000 words, in one of  the five official languages of the CIHA (German, English, French,  Italian, Spanish).  2) A summary in English of the proposal, not exceeding 250 words.  3) A selected Curriculum Vitae.

This conference will bring together up to forty scholars, photographers, curators and archivists from around the world in order to undertake new explorations of photography's past and its present.   Models for global, regional and local histories of photography are being rethought as a growing number of case studies develop our knowledge of previously unexamined or little known traditions as well as individual photographers. New visual vocabularies and practices are being constructed in vernacular, documentary and fine art forms; the same vocabularies and practices can also challenge these very categories and are often characterized by a turn to local histories and mythologies and personal experiences and needs. Emergent nations and cultural groups are using photography to construct their own histories and a sense of shared cultural heritage. At the same time, both photographers and photographs increasingly move between cultures, and the space between the local and the global has become a space of situatedness in its own right.   Documentary photography has been the object of critique but photography committed to human rights or \"peace photography\" is thrivingnot just in new forms but also through new strategies of intervention. The concern with aesthetics has similarly been out of favor in some quarters but there is also a renewed interest in the relationship of aesthetics and ethics.   In such contexts, the work of archives, galleries, photo agencies, festivals and other cultural organizations committed to the photographic image is more important than ever, as is the role of visual education. Where there is little state support for photography, such institutions often carry the responsibility for creating, preserving and disseminating photographic culture.   These are some of the areas and issues the conference aims to examine. The conference will focus in particular on the Middle East, North Africa and Asia. However, work about and from other regions is also welcomed, as are suggestions for other topics.   We invite both scholarly papers as well as presentations by those working with photography outside the academy. The organizers plan to publish a volume of selected papers and presentations. In addition, we would like to gather together important and previously un-translated writings on photography from the non-English-speaking world with a view of publishing an anthology in English. We would very much welcome suggestions and contributions in this area.   All travel, accommodation and subsistence expenses will be covered for all participants presenting at the conference. The conference is funded and hosted by the New York University Abu Dhabi Institute. It is organized in collaboration with the Arab Image Foundation.   Principal organizers:   Shamoon Zamir (NYUAD)  Issam Nassar (Arab Image Foundation)   Possible topics for proposals include, but are not limited to:  - New visual vocabularies in photography  - Archives & archival practices  - Alternative histories of photography  - Photography & human rights/ \"Peace Photography\"  - Photography and history  - Photography and aesthetics  - Cross-cultural encounters & movements  - Photographic genres, modes and audiences  - Image & text/the photobook   Proposals for papers or presentations, or for panels should provide as much detail as possible but should not exceed 500 words. Proposals will be reviewed by the principal organizers and an advisory committee. All papers and presentations will be 20 minutes. Submit a 500-word abstract and a 150 word biographical note to zge Calafato . Proposals should be submitted in the following format:     Name of the author(s)  Telephone and e-mail address  Affiliation  Title of proposal  Body of proposal     DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION: October 3, 2014 .

Nevertheless, working on global realities, and being confronted with relationships established diachronically as well as synchronically, we shall question the practices and the concepts that contribute to the way these transfers occur.  The II CHAM International Conference, conceived as a starting point of a strategic project on \"Frontiers\", will discuss \"Knowledge transfer and cultural exchanges\" from two perspectives, although not necessarily put apart.  A methodological and conceptual perspective aims at questioning practices and concepts associated to knowledge transfer: the concept of generation, the concept of network, the concept of learning, the concepts of reception and appropriation, the concepts of \"alterity\" and cultural areas (hence, cultural frontiers) among others. A historical perspective aims at identifying and discussing specific situations of knowledge transfer, comprehending values, customs, narratives, or scientific knowledge, and taking place in specific institutional, social and cultural realities, including family, school, or whatever exchange space is concerned.   We invite scholars from all humanities and social science disciplines to submit panel proposals on the following themes:     1. New directions in historiography  2. The strength of traditions  3. Identities, heritage and conflict  4. Language, communication, and translation  5. Making sense of the globe: space and territory  6. Networks and cultural power  7. Circulation and consumption of material and visual culture  8. Nature, science and world views  9. Generations  10. Learning: formal and informal  11. Obstacles and constraints to cultural transfer  12. Frontiers: visible and invisible  13. Culture and State     To propose a panel or for more information please visit the conference webpage: http://www.nomadit.co.uk/cham/cham2015/ .

The guiding question concerns the mutual constitutions of global art and locality, or the relation between situated, local art practices and the globalization of art.   Since the late 1980s, the term \"global art\" has come to replace both the notions of \"modern art\" and \"world art\" when referring to the visibility of today's art worlds. The discursive shift to global art was accompanied by the emergence of new types of art museums and a proliferation of art events in global cities such as Abu Dhabi, Istanbul, Beijing, or Moscow. In these new kinds of events and institutions, curators and artists seek to break away from the old binaries that have for so long defined the art world: distinctions between modern art and traditional artifact, between the Western center and the Non-Western periphery, or between historical art periods and ahistorical cultural legacies. Transcending these dichotomies, the term global art has been established to call attention to poly-centered, plural, and transnational art worlds under postcolonial conditions. Yet this process of globalizing art can also be criticized for producing its own hegemonic and exclusive effects. A global conception of art leads to a reconfiguration of the global as well as the local, and therefore to new normativities and power relations.   From this ambiguous point of departure, the \"Situating Global Art\" conference proposes to focus on recent art practices that are connected to the global art discourse while at the same time queering or resisting the new hegemonic narratives produced by that discourse. We would like to scrutinize the dynamics that unfold between the institutionalization of global art in specific sites on the one hand and local art practices on the other. More precisely, we are interested in the mechanisms, conflicts, and struggles that lead to new hegemonies and exclusions. In addition, we would like to ask how alternative articulations of the local, traditional, indigenous, or tribal become means of constituting site-specific versions of the global.   We would like to invite contributions that focus on particular art practices, festivals, or exhibitions, and on the ways in which they adopt, appropriate, transform, or reject the de-colonizing but also re-centralizing effects of a global art discourse.   Please submit your proposal including the title, an abstract (300-500 words) and a short bio before October 20, 2014 to globalart@zedat.fu-berlin.de .    back to page index     International Convention of Asia Scholars 9   Adelaide, Australia  5-9 July 2015   [from H-ASIA , 9/12/14]   Deadline proposals: 30 October 2014  Deadline ICAS Book Prize: 15 October 2014   ICAS 9 Adelaide, South Australia, will be held at the Adelaide Convention Centre from 5-9 July 2015.

Se constituant en genre littraire ds l'Antiquit, la satire a gagn les beaux-arts et les arts graphiques l'ge classique, seule ou en conjonction avec l'crit. Ce sont toutefois les mdias modernes - dition, presse, expositions, tlvision, internet - qui, en largissant progressivement sa sphre d'influence, ont renouvel ses formes et ses objectifs, et augment leur efficacit. Autorisant une diffusion plantaire et presque instantane des images satiriques, internet et les technologies numriques n'ont pas seulement transform la matrialit et les moyens d'action de cette imagerie et leurs effets socio-politiques, ils ont aussi affect les formes de la recherche sur le satirique en donnant accs de plus en plus rapidement des corpus extrmement vastes. La satire est ainsi partout, et aucun acteur ni canal de diffusion ne peut prtendre dsormais en contrler ses usages gnraliss.   Ce colloque porte sur la satire visuelle du 18 e sicle nos jours, entendue comme genre aussi bien que comme registre, selon que l'on s'intresse un type de reprsentations (caricaturale, en particulier) ou une veine (le satirique) traversant de multiples champs, parmi lesquels celui de l'art contemporain.

The 2015 Tufts University Art History Graduate Symposium  invites participants to consider how critical theory shapes historical  interpretations of spectacular objects in specific contexts. We  encourage submissions that consider how individual artists or  institutions use material and visual culture to manipulate audiences  through spectacle, as well as the audience responses produced.  Submissions that offer contributions to art history, visual culture,  literature, cultural studies, and related fields are all welcome.

Panels are welcomed from scholars throughout the field of Asian studies, wherever they may be based academically, and are especially encouraged from scholars representing academic communities that are relatively underrepresented in international meetings. One of the goals of this AAS-in-ASIA conference is to foster lines of dialogue and scholarly communication that cross the ordinary (often nation-specific) boundaries of academic networks. The program committee will strongly favor and give preference to proposals that include participants from two or more countries, whether the panel focuses on a single nation or culture or focuses on some comparative dimension. The program discourages panel proposals from a group of scholars coming from the same institution. Generally speaking, panels with diverse (gender, academic rank, national origin, disciplinary approach) participation will be favored over narrowly constructed panels. Panels that address topics of broad relevance will also be preferred.   The deadline for proposal submissions is October 31, 2014 at 5:00 p.m. EST. All proposals must be submitted electronically via the proposal submission website . After submission, your proposal will be forwarded to the Program Committee for review. You will find detailed instructions for submissions below. You may also access detailed information about the conference (FAQs, venue, transportation, program, accommodation, etc.) via the links on the left-hand side menu.   If you have any questions regarding panel participation that are not answered in this Call for Proposals or FAQ, please contact Justin McDaniel .

We welcome proposals by academics, teachers, independent researchers, students, artists, NGOs and anyone interested in manifestations of monstrosity in space. Possible topics may include topics as diverse as ancient burial sites, haunted houses, post-apocalyptic landscapes, and even recent topographical manifestations of the Gaza conflict or the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Even if they no longer bear the physical markers of violence, devastation and human suffering geographical locations are often imbued with memories of horror that are passed on from generation to generation through various textual, audial and visual media.   Apart from historical events of monstrosity the scope of our conference  entails imagined monstrosities and future landscapes of annihilation and  death. Philosophical discussions are just as much welcome as artistic  performances and explorations of literary, filmic or musical case  studies of evil and the monstrous. The following questions may trigger  ideas for presentations: What is the relationship between evil and the  monstrous? Is the monstrous always rooted in the element of evil? Can  disasters caused by nature be regarded as evil? Can we talk about  geographies of poverty, hunger and homelessness in relation to  monstrosity? Can evil and/or monstrosity be immanent to place or are  they performed by cultural discourse, rituals and practices of memory?  How do the monstrous and the geographic intersect in architecture, the  arts, popular culture, politics, and the sciences?   We welcome presentations, papers, reports, performances,  work-in-progress, workshops and pre-formed panels from all academic  disciplines. Presentations may include but are not limited to the  following topics:  - Unknown worlds  - Dystopic landscapes  - Sites of heterotopia  - Malevolent regions  - Bodies as maps and maps as bodies  - Places of isolation, incarceration and madness  - Places of rituals and incest  - Sites of experimentation  - Evil planets and dimensions  - Worlds as dark reflections/twins of Earth  - Alien landscapes  - Sites of environmental disasters (both natural and manmade)  - Sites of starvation, disaster and pestilence  - De-militarized zones and no-man's lands  - Monstrostiy and liminality  - Religion, ritual and monstrosity  - Haunted sites and spectral spaces  - Graveyards  - Sites of conflict and violence  - Terrain vague, abandoned buildings  - The architecture of death and destruction (sites of torture and extermination)  - Geographical manifestations of the uncanny  - Tourism and monstrous geographies  - Monstrous dreamscapes  - Mazes  - Monstrous materialities  - Ethics and morality in relation to monstrosity and evil  - Monstrous geographies of the body and the mind   The Steering Group particularly welcomes the submission of pre-formed  panel proposals.   300 word abstracts should be submitted by Friday 31st October 2014 . All  submissions are minimally double blind peer reviewed where appropriate.  If an abstract is accepted for the conference, a full draft paper should  be submitted by Friday 23rd January 2015. Abstracts should be submitted  simultaneously to the Organising Chairs; abstracts may be in Word or RTF  formats with the following information and in this order:     a) author(s),  b) affiliation as you would like it to appear in programme,  c) e-mail address,  d) title of abstract,  e) body of abstract,  f) up to 10 keywords.     E-mails should be entitled: MG4 Abstract Submission.

Jahrhunderts [Objectivity and imagination: Natural history in the art of the 20th and 21st centuries]\"   Sprengel Museum Hannover  Hannover, Germany  19-20 June 2015   [from H-Arthist , 9/7/14]   Die Tagung widmet sich dem Nachleben von Darstellungstraditionen der Naturgeschichte durch Aneignungen in der Kunst des 20. und 21. Jahrhunderts und damit dem Austausch und der Differenz naturwissenschaftlicher und sthetischer Bildstrategien. Bei der Wiedergabe und Erfindung von Bildern der Natur haben Knstlerinnen und Knstler bis heute gleichsam als naturkundliche Forscher fungiert. Anders als in der Frhen Neuzeit, in der vor allem die mimetische Dokumentation und Idealisierung der Naturbereiche eine vordergrndige Rolle spielte, gewann vor allem seit Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts die ku?nstlerische Imagination mit ihren Adaptionen und Neuschpfungen an Bedeutung, gestaltete den Bildinhalt mit und gab neben einer forschenden Herangehensweise auch Fiktionen der Naturgeschichte Raum.   Ziel der Tagung ist es, die Verbindung von Kunst und Naturgeschichte in ihren verschiedenen Ausprgungen seien sie kunsttheoretisch, (quasi-)wissenschaftlich oder experimentell- knstlerisch whrend des 20. und 21. Jahrhunderts zu untersuchen. Es gilt, knstlerische Strategien der Darstellung von Naturwissen und der Entwicklung von Natur herauszuarbeiten. Unter diesen verschiedenen Perspektiven einer knstlerischen Naturerfassung ist nicht auer Acht zu lassen, dass auch der Mensch sich immer in Relation zur Natur gesetzt hat. Aufgrund neuer wissenschaftlicher Theorien und Anstze, neuer Instrumente und Beobachtungsmedien, kologischer und konomischer Paradigmenwechsel, fortschreitender und sich ausweitender Industrialisierung und nicht zuletzt der zwei Weltkriege ist das Verhltnis des Menschen zur Natur in der Moderne ein grundlegend problematisches. Die Vielfalt der belebten und unbelebten Natur erweist sich damit als ein knstlerisches Wissens- und \"Forschungsgebiet.\" Zu den Bezugspunkten einer solchen Naturrezeption zhlen u. a. der Zugang von Knstlerinnen und Knstlern zu wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen und die Aneignung von naturkundlichen Formsprachen, Ordnungsprinzipien und Methoden.   Mit Blick auf das Spannungsfeld von Objektivitt und Imagination in der Naturbeobachtung und -darstellung sollen offene Fragen geklrt werden zu Gemeinsamkeiten von Kunst und Wissenschaft und zu den Grenzen ihres Zusammenwirkens, zum Bild als Vermittlungsinstanz von Wissen, zur sthetik von Natur und zum Einfluss der Kunst auf die Naturforschung. Beitrge knnen zu folgenden Schwerpunkten und Themen eingereicht werden:     Grundlagen [Basics]  Es geht darum, die Grundlagen fr eine Kunst herauszustellen, die sich mit Naturkunde und ihrer Darstellung befasst. Dazu zhlen einerseits wissenschaftliche Publikationen, auf die in der Kunst Bezug genommen worden ist und die als grundlegend fr Fragestellungen von Kunst und Naturkunde im 20. und 21. Jahrhundert verstanden werden knnen, andererseits Quellen und Materialien, mit denen die Kunst naturwissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse reflektiert und verarbeitet hat. Der Einfluss von philosophischen Strmungen, Wissenschaftsdiskursen, kologischen Erkenntnissen oder ideologischen Programmen auf die Auseinandersetzung von Knstlerinnen und Knstlern mit Naturkunde ist ebenfalls zu beleuchten. Darber hinaus sind auch Knstlerkommentare (z. B. Joseph Beuys) oder konkrete Dialoge zwischen Kunst und Naturkunde von Interesse, wie sie sich auf verschiedenen Ebenen immer wieder ergeben haben, zum Beispiel in der Geschichte des Naturfilms.   Naturbeobachtung/Naturwahrnehmung [Observation/perception of nature]  Ein wichtiger Bereich bezieht sich auf den Aspekt der Wahrnehmung, des Beobachtens und Sehens. Zu untersuchen sind Analogien und Differenzen zwischen einer auf Objektivitt basierenden Naturwissenschaft und einer subjektiven Bildpraxis (u. a. Paul Klee, Willi Baumeister, Wols). Der Wahrnehmungsaspekt umfasst die Frage danach, was und wie die Naturkunde (als Wissenschaft) ber ihre Institutionen vermittelt oder von welchem Standort aus Natur erforscht wird, gemeint ist z. B. die knstlerische Arbeit in Naturkundemuseen (u. a. Emil Nolde, Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner), auch in Gegenberstellung zur Arbeit in der Natur. Die fachkundlichen Ordnungen von Naturmaterialien und ihre Prsentationen knnen dabei zur Ausgangsbasis fr die knstlerische Komposition und Umsetzung werden.   Die Rolle des Knstlers [The role of the artist]  Mit der Moderne geriet das traditionelle Rollenbild des Knstlers ins Wanken. Insbesondere wenn Wissenschaftlichkeit in der knstlerischen Praxis Anwendung findet, ist diese Rolle neu zu berdenken. Diesen Typus eines Knstler-Forschers gilt es, in seiner Funktion und Konsequenz zu beschreiben und fr die Moderne greifbar zu machen (u. a. Eadweard Muybridge, Karl Blossfeldt, Jean Painleve?). Den Strategien der Objektivierung, wie sie die Wissenschaft methodisch einsetzt, steht das (Auto-)Biografische gegenber, das immer wieder Einzug in Naturzeichnungen bzw. wissenschaftlich-knstlerische Darstellungen genommen hat (u. a. Ernst Haeckel).   Adaption von Ordnungsprinzipien [Adaptation of principles of order]  In Bezug auf das mit dem 19. Jahrhundert entstehende wissenschaftliche Inventar sind knstlerische Auseinandersetzungen mit Ordnungen, Systemen und Methoden der Naturwissenschaft zu behandeln. Ebenso wie Formen naturhistorischer Aufzeichnung (lexikalische, enzyklopdische u. a.) wurden diese von Knstlerinnen und Knstlern bewusst oder unbewusst adaptiert (Marcel Duchamp, Hans Arp, Sol LeWitt, Gerhard Richter, Max Ernst, Marc Dion).   Neuschpfungen von Naturgeschichte [Re-creations of natural history]  Zu wichtigen Parametern zhlt auch die Nhe zur historia naturalis selbst. Knstlerinnen und Knstler haben sich dieses Wissenskomplexes und seiner Teilbereiche angenommen und immer wieder zu eigenen Naturgeschichten gefunden. Die Werke und ihre Bedeutung, vor allem in direktem Bezug auf Vorbilder, knnen in den Blick genommen werden (u. a. Max Ernst, Damien Hirst). Nicht ausschlielich zur Naturgeschichte, auch ber den Aspekt der Schpfung von Natur und die in ihr wirkenden Krfte und Gewalten, ihre chaotischen Zustnde und Ordnungssysteme haben Knstlerinnen und Knstler zur Natur gearbeitet.   Knstlerische Strategien [Artistic strategies]  Gegenstand einer Analyse kann die Einbeziehung von Fachgebieten der Naturkunde in die knstlerische Praxis sein, z. B. der Anatomie, Morphologie oder Meeresbiologie (u. a. Franz Marc, Jacques Cousteau). Zu fragen ist, inwieweit Interdisziplinaritt oder Spezialisierung zur knstlerischen Strategie werden oder Mittel zum Zweck sind. Das Streben der Avantgarde nach einer Verbindung von Kunst und Leben hat die Analogie von Kunst und Natur besttigt und u. a. das Zufallsprinzip als tertium comparationis zum Vehikel ihrer Kunstauffassung gemacht. Auch das Prinzip der natura naturans ist im Rahmen knstlerischer Ausdrucksweise nher zu betrachten.   Darstellungsmodi [Modes of display]  Augenfllig sind zweierlei Richtungen in der Kunst, die sachliche Naturwiedergabe ebenso wie die Natur als Abstraktion: Naturbilder oszillieren zwischen objektiver Naturbeobachtung und mimetischer Wirklichkeitsaneignung einerseits und Fantasie und Fiktion andererseits. Es ist zu untersuchen, inwieweit Bildprogramme eines Naturwissens ein Spiegel von Welt, Politik und Gesellschaft sind und welchen Denkstrmungen sie folgen.   Medium und Technik [Medium and technique]  Ein weiteres Forschungsfeld bildet das technische Bild, zum Beispiel bei der Sichtbarmachung und Aufzeichnung von Prozessen und naturkundlichen Darstellungen. Welche Bedeutung besitzt das Medium der Aufzeichnung fr ein Verstndnis, eine Erfahrung und Vorstellung von Natur und ihre knstlerisch-wissenschaftliche Erfassung? Sehr konkret knnen auch die Rolle von Medien und Instrumenten und ihre Bedeutung fr die Entstehung knstlerischer und naturkundlicher Erkenntnisprozesse ins Zentrum der Betrachtung rcken: Welchen Einfluss haben die bildgebenden Verfahren der Wissenschaft auf die Kunst und welchen Einfluss nehmen knstlerische Medien und Techniken auf wissenschaftliche Bilder der Natur?     Als interdisziplinr angelegte Tagung mit Schwerpunkt auf der Kunstgeschichte sind ausdrcklich auch Beitrge aus assoziierten Fachbereichen erwnscht. Die Tagung steht allen Interessierten offen. Tagungssprache ist deutsch. Eine Publikation der Tagungsbeitrge ist geplant. Vorgesehen sind Vortrge von maximal 30 Minuten.   Bei Interesse an einem Beitrag bitten wir um die Zusendung von einem Arbeitstitel und einem Abstract (max. eine Seite) sowie einer Kurz-Biografie bis zum 31. Oktober 2014 per E-Mail an tagung.naturgeschichte@web.de . Fr Rckfragen zur Tagung und weitere Informationen stehen wir gerne zur Verfgung.

Volume 34 Lessons from History (July 2014)   Deadline for copy: 1 May 2014   Will the past help us explain the present? Is our interest in past   events and historical figures a way of re-imagining the present or does   the lesson work only to overcome our ignorance and curiosity about the   past, reinforcing a sense of how things were different then? Many   feminist art works have chosen as their subject matter female figures   from history as a means to re-imagine and re-image the past in the   present or to speculate about different forms of female   subjectivity/subjection/objectification/resistance. n.paradoxa invites   women artists, curators and critics to discuss art works (visual arts   only) which look at women in the past in terms of family histories;   social histories of women's labour or protest; stories about or based   on women's lives--including their lives as artists--for this volume.   Contributions where the subject/content of the artworks is based on any   period in history are welcome but the artworks by women artists   discussed must have been produced post-1970 to be considered. This   volume would also welcome contributions about feminist art histories   (or more precisely, histories of feminist art practices, post-1970) in   terms of how we construct the \"legacy\" of the last 40 years. In-depth   critiques of models in art history or histories of feminist art   exhibitions which have been \"national\"; \"global\"; \"generational\" or   \"wave\"-based are welcomed.   Volume 35 War (Jan 2015)   Deadline for copy: 1 November 2014   It is frequently stated that the number of wars in the world after the   Second World War continues to increase, but that these wars are local,   civil or \"contained\" as military conflicts in particular hotspots or   sites. Everyone is conscious of how wars mean not only death in armed   conflict but also aerial bombing, drones or military campaigns designed   to terrorise a population, the displacement of many people as refugees   and the disruption of all routines in everyday life. From the Vietnam   War of the 1960s to the present conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq,   etc, feminist artists have responded and produced works which look at   the impact of war on people's lives (particularly women); the stories   of refugees and those living in camps; the landscapes produced as a   result of war; and the division by conflicts of people and places. n.paradoxa seeks contributions which address the works of women artists   on the subject of war: be it critical examinations of the military;   responses to the devastation war causes; the stories of refugees and   survivors; or the transformation of lives and families that results   from war. The focus of the volume will be on works of women artists   (post-1970, visual arts only).   Volume 36 Humour (July 2015)   Deadline for copy: 1 May 2015   Women's humour is often regarded as a neglected subject. Women's wit   and cleverness recurs frequently in women artists' work. Irony,   pastiche and parody have long been subjects of women's attempt to turn   the male status quo on its head and subvert norms and mores. Humour is   a tricky subject: one's person's sense of fun may not be shared by   many. This volume will attempt to enlighten, amuse and tickle the   reader's fancy by considering and presenting works by women artists   which examine the ridiculous, the absurd and the strange that will   still bring a subversive smile to a woman's face. Contributions by   women artists which deal with jokes, humorous pieces, absurdity, irony,   pastiche, parody and subversion of the status quo using slapstick and   comedy will all be welcomed. Articles by women critics or curators who   have attempted to present women's humour or have examined controversies   which have arrived as a result will all be welcomed.     back to page index     Transmortale VI: \"Neue Forschungen zu Sterben, Tod und Trauer [New research on dying, death and grief]\"   Museum fr Sepulkralkultur  Kassel, Germany  7 March 2015   [from H-Arthist , 10/4/14]   Alle Epochen und Kulturen zeigen, dass der Tod nicht nur die Toten betrifft, sondern vor allem die Lebenden. Fr die Wissenschaft bedeutet das, dass alle Fcher und Forschungsfelder, die sich mit den Menschen und dem Leben beschftigen, auch Berhrungspunkte mit dem Tod, dem Abschied oder der Endlichkeit haben.   Die Themen Sterben, Tod und Trauer rcken seit einigen Jahren immer mehr in den Fokus der fcherbergreifenden Forschung. Disziplinen wie die Archologie, Ethnologie, Volkskunde/Kulturanthropologie oder Kunstgeschichte beschftigen sich seit jeher mit Grbern und Begrbnispltzen. Inzwischen interessieren sich jedoch ganz unterschiedliche Disziplinen fr den Wandel der Trauer- und Bestattungskultur wie z.B. die Soziologie, Psychologie, aber auch Geschichte, Geschlechterforschung und Medienwissenschaften.   Der Workshop ist offen fr junge Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftler aus der Nachwuchsforschung, wie z.B. Studierende in der Abschlussphase oder Doktoranden, aber auch fr Postdocs und interessierte Forschende. Ziel des Workshops ist, Wissenschaftlerinnen und Wissenschaftlern die Mglichkeit zu bieten, neue Forschungsperspektiven in Kurzreferaten vorzustellen und diese in einer greren Runde zu diskutieren. Auf diese Weise knnen aktuelle Fragen und Ergebnisse interdisziplinr beleuchtet und inhaltliche Gemeinsamkeiten transdisziplinr zusammengefhrt werden. Die \"Transmortale\" findet jhrlich statt und bietet ber den Workshop hinaus eine Plattform fr das Forschungsfeld Sterben, Tod und Trauer.

This is evident, for  instance, in the recent and contemporaneous rise of fields such as  affect theory and object theory, and of art historical practices based  in material culture and neuro-psychological analysis. As scholars and  artists move further from the dogma of twentieth century methodologies  (e.g., dominant strains of semiotics, social history, and formalism)  they have exhibited new interest in the social, cultural, and political  lives of things and materials and of sensations and emotions. As such,  these engagements with the material and immaterial have generated new  considerations of otherwise repressed or ignored phenomena in both  theory and experience.   By looking at quotidian and inanimate matter, or at sensory experiences  that remain irreducible to language and meaning, objects and affects  reveal the blind spots in how we construct and view the world. It is  therefore increasingly important to understand how the production and  reception of art and culture is not simply the creation of conscious  human agency, but is informed by these many materials and sensations.  At the same time, any assumed separation between these domains remains  dubious, as both point to sources of experience and agency that lie  beyond the conscious, individual subject; that is, in a world shared  among things and feelings, through bodies and experiences. In this  respect, we invite proposal for scholarly presentations that explore  the social, cultural, and political implications and ramifications of  objects and affects within aesthetic and cultural production.   Hypothetical topics include, but are not limited to:  - The use of readymade or found objects.  - The influence of phenomenology in art practice and theory.  - Archives, cabinets of curiosities, collections, and the ordering of  things.  - Technological invention and the object-based mediation of existence.  - Sensation and aesthetic experience.  - Technological invention of art marking and art history practices.  - Social and cultural histories of materials.  - Actor network theory and political assemblages.   Please submit an abstract of under 250 words and a CV to   gustasymposium@gmail.com by November 7, 2014 .   back to page index     Association of Art Historians   Annual Conference and Bookfair  University of East Anglia  Norwich, UK  9-11 April 2015   [from AAH , 11/2/14; select sessions listed below]   This international conference aims to showcase new research in histories and theories of visual art forms and media, of any period and type (including architecture and design). Academic sessions will engage with current scholarship, and foster discussion and debate, on any aspect of the visual arts from prehistory, Antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the early modern and modern periods, through to the present day.   If you would like to offer a paper, please email the session convenor(s) direct, providing an abstract of a proposed paper of 30 minutes. Your paper abstract should be no more than 250 words, and include your name and institution affiliation (if any).

The Aesthetics of Invitation: Art at the threshold of hospitality  Session Convenor: Kelly Rae Aldridge (Stony Brook University, New York)  Both guest and host share etymological roots in \"enemy.\" This underscores the singular capacity of hospitality to create unique spaces where the foreign and the familiar entangle without collapsing their inherent difference. Hospitality maintains its deeply archaic roots through performed rituals and sensuous customs. However, recent exhibitions such as the Liverpool Biennial The Unexpected Guest and the Smart Museum of Art's Feast: Radical Hospitality call attention to the contemporaneity of hospitality as a method for giving definition to the expanded borders of socially engaged art while simultaneously offering invitation to cross those borders. This session will investigate historical conceptions of welcoming, giving, nourishing and sheltering the other. It will also consider hospitality as a method for interrogating the aesthetics of encounter and exchange in current art practice, theory and exhibition. This session welcomes papers that address representations of hospitality, the politics of hosting or guesting (from an interpersonal to international scale), and the relationship between hospitality and art institutions.   3. The Art History of Architectural History  Session Convenors: Mark Crinson (University of Manchester) and Richard Williams (University of Edinburgh)  Art history and architectural history are sister disciplines or are they? How many art history departments regard architectural history as a core component of their provision? What might art history students miss if architectural history were not part of their curricula? Perhaps art objects and architectural objects are so radically different their study cannot be shared. Or perhaps there are modes of enquiry that can be developed to mutual benefit. This session reviews the art history/architectural history relationship in several ways. One way is to excavate those moments when art and architectural history were tightly bound together: in the very formation of art history as a discipline, for example, when both art and architecture were natural objects of study. Other ways might be: investigations of the parallel developments of formalism in art and architectural history; of architectural history's relation to the \"new art history\"; of the ways in which architectural history might adopt recent developments in object studies, global art history, and art writing. Academics dealing with contemporary architecture find themselves wrestling with debates that in other disciplines may be more abstract or indirect: How does money or power represent itself in visual form? How does the general public (whoever they may be) understand form? How does government use aesthetics to communicate? All of these things are, and always have been, live in architecture. Perhaps this might be part of a case for making architectural history more central to art history. If so, what implications would it have for our curricula and our pedagogy?   5. Avant-Gardes and Wars  Session Convenors: Lynda Morris (Norwich University of the Arts), Krzysztof Fijalkowski (Norwich University of the Arts) and Alisa Miller (Norwich University of the Arts)  Ever since the term was first borrowed from its original military context, avant-garde artists have consistently produced work in reaction to their experience of war. Since the late 19th century, diverse groups of artists can be linked as an avant-garde , not through the formalist style of their work but through their response to the violence engendered by apparently never-ending global conflicts. The politicisation of artists manifest in their anti-war work since the late 19th century has been the subject of a number of recent art historical studies. Our lives continue to be overshadowed by the politically driven wars of the present day, and the ethical and philosophical problems of artists' responses to war continue to influence both art and art history. This session seeks papers that consider how the politicisation of avant-garde artists and their work provides a context for experimental modes of production and distribution between the late 19th century and today; critical engagement with the division of Europe after World War II and the ideological conflicts of the Cold War through to 1989; artistic responses to philosophic writings engaged with the moral and ethical implications of war. Whilst we particularly welcome proposals dealing with the art of the modernist avant-garde , we would welcome longer historical perspectives giving more formally complex ideas of artistic political avant-gardes .   8. Critiquing Curiosity: The rhetoric of wonder, and the sensationalism of nature in contemporary art  Session Convenors: Donna Roberts (independent scholar) and Victoria Carruthers (Australian Catholic University)  In recent years a plethora of exhibitions and publications have tapped into the currency of the auratic terms \"curiosity\" and \"wonder.\" The influential rehabilitation of these words by Foucault and Deleuze follows the surrealists' use of key concepts from early modern natural philosophy in order to develop a method for imaginative or poetic organisation, working outside strictly scientific or rational taxonomies. Georges Bataille's subversion of the Encyclopedic and Roger Caillois' concept of \"diagonal science\" represent the radical edge of this critique. This perspective has afforded curators and artists a potentially dynamic, lyrical and alternative model for the conceptualising and displaying of works. However, rather than mobilising an interdisciplinary focus on art and science, which extends the potential to truly subvert, critique or reveal, recent practice has led to a restaging of the visual and material culture of natural history in ways that are epistemologically nostalgic. These ways risk cultivating a popular rhetoric that reduces the radical potential of \"curiosity\" by homogenising, commodifying, or sensationalising taxonomical paradoxes. This session will analyse this return to \"curiosity,\" and examine how it is mobilised in contemporary art, writing and display. We welcome papers that address any aspect of the topic including: those prepared to scrutinise the rhetoric; those that suggest an ongoing critical and political potential for \"curiosity\"; those that support the appeal of this historical discourse based on visual affectivity and the blurring of taxonomical boundaries, and those that might address a need for distinction in the age of globalisation and the relativisation of the internet.   9. Death, between Sublimation and the Real  Session convenors: Sergio Cortesini (University of Pisa) and Chiara Savettieri (University of Pisa)  According to Rgis Debray, the plastic impulse originated as a response to the unacceptable decomposition of the corpse. The secularisation brought by modernity elicited new problematic discourses on life and death, while philosophers (Heidegger, Derrida, Lvinas) explored the existentialist dimension of death in an era left spiritually bereft. Still, the frequency of the theme of death in recent art encourages us to ask if we are witnessing a cultural turn in the concept of dying and if art is adapting its strategies of representation and symbolisation. Many artists have addressed the fear of finality, bereavement and the search for transcendence. The acknowledgment that death is the \"fraternising\" event common to all human beings has inspired artworks and forms of analysis that offer ethical models of empathy, friendship, social and political relations. Yet the parallel tendency to present death in its cadaverous decomposition or literalness suggests the closure to any possibility of articulating meaning. Does the latter trendespecially in the last 30 yearsimply that art is no longer conceived as a symbolic operation in response to the trauma of the real but rather as an ostentatious unveiling of the traumatic real per se ? We invite papers exploring the dual manner in which death has been addressed in artparticularly after the Enlightenment and/or the advent of modern industrialised societiesthrough forms of sublimation, or through the exposure of the real.   10. Deconstructing Boundaries: Is \"East Asian Art\" possible?  Session Convenor: Eriko Tomizawa-Kay (Sainsbury Institute for the Study of Japanese Arts and Cultures)  The aim of this session is to give insight into the changing boundaries and concepts of \"modern art\" in Japan and East Asia. In particular, we hope to illuminate the exchanges and dialogues that took place between Japanese and other East Asian artists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, an experiential technique called morotai used by Japanese-style Nihonga artists such as Hishida Shunso (18741911) influenced Korean and Chinese artists, but in turn, other Nihonga painters were influenced by Chinese and Korean art. Therefore, the birth of modern East Asian art could not have occurred without the symbiotic relationship between each of these groups of artists. Papers will ideally challenge the existing geographic, temporal, and generic paradigms that currently frame the arts of East Asia. What was the relationship between artistic production and political discourse such as Pan-Asianism, Japan's colonialism, and the Second World War? What role did abiding cultural legacies play in the artistic development of East Asia at large? Scholars interested in issues surrounding the emergence of the geo-cultural boundaries in East Asian art of the late 19th century onwards, the institutional approaches to art and history, the idea of \"national art,\" or new frameworks for the concept of modernity in East Asian art, are encouraged to submit proposals. Questions relating to methodology in (re)-constructing a broad history of East Asian art will also be addressed in this session.   13. Flow in World Art (1500-1750)  Session Convenor: Margit Thfner (University of East Anglia)  This session considers the notion of flow in the early modern period in the broadest possible terms. During this time, most parts of the globe became connected by shipping lanes. The already steady trickle of people, objects and ideas across the continents and oceans became a full flow. That waterways could both conjoin and divide was evident in a manner that it had never been before. At the same time, liquids such as sap, mercury, lava, semen, milk and blood came under intense interrogation, in moral, political, theological and scientific terms. What consequences did this fascination with fluidity have for the arts? Depicting flow is of necessity an act of fixing runniness. Liquids may work as boundaries but, at the same time, they are boundless. How did early modern artists and artisans address this paradox? How did they show fluidity, whether of persons, ideas or substances? The aim of this session is to consider, compare and contrast how image-makers from across the world tackled such problems. Our ultimate goal is to determine whether, how and why the concept of flow changed visually under the manifold pressures of early colonialism. We welcome contributions focused anywhere in the world within the given dates and we are particularly interested in examples where two or more pictorial or artefactual traditions are brought together. We hope to publish selected papers from this session in a dedicated issue of the journal World Art .   14. From Distaste to Mockery: The city and its architectures ridiculed  Session Convenor: Michela Rosso (Politecnico di Torino)  Since the origins of the contemporary age, the rise of a mass public and a reconfigured public sphere, along with the diffusion of the popular press, have deeply affected the way in which the city and its architectures are interpreted and judged. Among the genres addressing the modern city, some emerge that seem to be highly effective in disseminating the architectural culture, displaying its distortions or singling out its vulnerable features through the deployment of humour. As part of a media-saturated public culture, humour is both a practice of social communication and a plausible portrayal of society, illuminating the ambivalences of modern life and uncovering the shock provoked by processes of modernisation. This session's aim is to inaugurate a catalogue of the comic as applied to the spatial criticism of the city, its artefacts and its leading professionalsarchitects, artists and builders. Punch 's sharp satire of the first World Exhibition, William H Robinson's caricatures of modernist housing, Tati's parody of the Corbusian villa, and Dunn's architecturally situated cartoons for The New Yorker are some of the renowned entries in this possible catalogue. By absorbing the disturbing effects of modernisation and turning them into laughter, they give voice to a diverse range of feelings and social reactions, from distaste to overt dissent. This session invites case studies that explore the reception of architectural facts through the distinct codes of humour, verbal as well as visual, in any place and time, between 1750 and today, and focusing on any medium from literature to cinema, television and cartoons.   15. Groundwork  Session Convenors: Carla Benzan (University College London) and Catherine McCormack (University College London)   It is also not a question of repainting the skies... it is a question of opening up the earth, dark, hard and lost in space (Jean-Luc Nancy). This session seeks to critically engage with the ground in representation (earth, dirt, soil, rocks, stones, cliffs, mountains) and the ground of representation. While related art historical literature has often focused on avant-garde practices such as Earthworks, or has addressed the ground as an articulation of the sublime within the genre of landscape painting, the recent \"material turn\" in the humanities provides in-roads for addressing the ground within an expanding set of theoretical possibilities and outside of the traditional art historical loci. Somewhere between matter and form, the ground can be foundational support, marker of territory, and yet also inchoate, anonymous \"other.\" In representation it often seems to display itself as surface, while simultaneously withholding something of itself or other objects from sight or thought. This session invites papers that embrace this difficult silence, whether in depictions of the ground, or in works made from the material substance of the ground, across all historical periods and media, as well as papers that explore how the ground might determine represented space and time. How does the ground implicate the body and provide it with a \"place\"? Can it challenge the historical notion of time which has, until now, determined how we write our histories of art? Following Nancy's invitation, we seek papers that take on the difficulty of the ground, and its promise.   17. Materialising Modern Identities: Architectural sculpture after 1750  Session Convenors: Katie Faulkner (Courtauld Institute of Art) and Ayla Lepine (University of Essex)  In recent years, sculpture studies within art and architectural history have grown exponentially, increasingly taking diverse themes into account including materiality, gender, postcolonialism and affect. In the rapid transformations of state power and imperial activity in the 18th century, through into the post-revolutionary political atmosphere of the 19th century, nations appeared to sponsor the celebration of the public citizen and actively projected imperial stability in the midst of change and resistance. Despite its association with permanence, sculpture was charged with representing change: materialising new identities and formulating representational traditions. Architectural sculpture in particular marked sites of urban modernity, such as stations, cultural institutions, civic landmarks and sacred structures; these large and prestigious commissions often sparked public debate around identity and artistic production. As the onset and outcomes of the First World War shaped the power and politics of cultural memory, sculpture took centre stage, with new responsibilities amongst global tensions. Interwar architectural sculpture negotiated and articulated increasing anxieties regarding ornament, historicism, modernism and minimalism. With the arrival of modernism worldwide, some believed architectural sculpture was anathema. Others looked to it as the vehicle to facilitate and embody vitality in bold new architectural experimentation. Architectural sculpture was a crucible for artistic and wider cultural dialogue concerning modern life and modern subjects. We invite proposals for papers that explore architectural sculpture and identity in a global context between 1750 and the present. Potential themes include: collaboration and networks between architects and sculptors; materiality, production and reproduction; modernism and tradition; beauty and ugliness; figuration and abstraction; style and historicism; form, function and ornament; spectacle and the everyday; memory and ritual; nationhood and transnationalism; and empire and its afterlives.   18. Mediating Collaboration: The politics of working together  Session Convenors: Amy Tobin (University of York), Harry Weeks (University of Edinburgh) and Catherine Spencer (University of St Andrews)  Encompassing both a theoretical methodology and a mode of practice, the term collaboration' has suffered from its diverse usage in artistic contexts. Practices from \"democratising\" artistnon-artist approaches (e.g., WochenKlausur) to formalised artistartist partnerships (Gilbert & George) and activist or pedagogic projects (The Feminist Art Program) have all been subsumed under the rubric of collaboration, which is also often defined reactively against other forms of practice such as collectivism or participation. In addition, recent digital technological developments have further impacted on the spatial and temporal dynamics of collaboration. While this has afforded new collaborative possibilities, both within art and beyond, it has also complicated an already bloated terminology. Spatial and temporal factors such as immediacy, presence and duration have often been considered central to collaborative acts. By focusing on the specificity of communication channels and technologies, however, we can challenge such assumptions and gain critical purchase on collaboration and the politics of working together. How might feminist, queer and post-colonial perspectives on space and time inform understandings of the media involved in collaboration? How have communication channels from television and the radio through to mail networks and the internet impacted on the relations or relationships constituted through artistic collaboration? We invite papers that together might begin to establish longer histories of collaboration and its media, and embrace their recursive, retrogressive and heterogeneous potentialities.   20. Museums & Exhibitions Session: Travelling Artworks  Session Convenors: Catriona Pearson (Ashmolean Museum) and Marie-Thrse Mayne (Durham Cathedral)  This session explores issues of artworks and exhibitions on the move, whether as loans in the gallery and museum context, or in exhibitions and biennials. In a global world, art is constantly on the move, thanks to the world's growing number of contemporary art biennials, but also to historical collections, which are lent with increased frequency to museums and galleries worldwide. Though artwork loans are not new, digitisation of historical collections has improved the visibility of these collections, encouraging loan requests from an increasing number of international venues. Contemporary artists are ever more engaged with the online art community, and so contemporary art curators are similarly challenged to negotiate this complex international context. The display of artworks and exhibitions in new locations and venues can problematise the interpretation of these artworks. A challenge is posed to artists and to curators of both contemporary and historical exhibitions: how to engage local audiences with these objects without losing the work's original meaning and context? How do artworks and art exhibitions change when they are re-located? How can changing locations benefit or enhance understanding of artworks and exhibitions? In this global context, what happens to artwork that cannot be re-located, or is site-specific?   21. National Histories of Art beyond the Nation's Borders  Geraldine Johnson (CIHA-UK Committee; University of Oxford) and Toshio Watanabe (CIHA-UK Committee; University of the Arts London)  CIHA (Comit international d'histoire de l'art) is an art historical organisation of global reach that is organised into national committees. This session, convened by two members of CIHA's British committee, sets out to investigate the promotion and production of national histories of art within transnational and global contexts. Since the 19th century, the scholarly discipline of art history has been dominated by nation-based narratives, which still have a powerful presence and influence. This session will consider the ways in which such nation-based narratives have been fostered, enabled, promoted and problematised beyond the borders of the nation in question. Sometimes this has been the explicit intention of particular institutions, such as the Dutch University Institute in Florence, the British School at Rome or the Centre allemand d'histoire de l'art in Paris, situated beyond the borders of the nation whose culture they study. Sometimes it has been the result of external forces, as for example in the 1930s and '40s, when universities in Britain and the United States provided a significant home for art historians fleeing Nazi-occupied Europe whose work can be considered in light of their refugee experience. Equally, national histories of art have had an impact on each other: for example, Kakuzo Okakura's ideas about the art history of Japan had an incendiary relationship to the Tagore circle's ideas about the art history of India. We welcome proposals for papers that address the character of national histories of art produced, promoted or influenced in some way from beyond the nation's borders.   22. Navigating the Pacific: Latin America and Asia in conversation  Session Convenors: Kathryn Santner and Paul Merchant (University of Cambridge)  The critical role of Asia in the history of Latin American art has often been overlooked; recent scholarship has, however, begun to reassess this longstanding cultural engagement. This session will examine the significance of Asia-Latin America exchange from its earliest days via the Manila Galleon and Portuguese trade networks through to the present day. Iberian trade brought luxury goods porcelain, lacquerware, folding screens, ivories, and inlaid furniture to the Americas, where they were adapted and incorporated into local artistic practice, spawning new art forms like the biombo. The decline of the galleon trade after 1815 did not mark the end of this transpacific relationship; ensuing centuries brought successive waves of Asian immigrants to Latin Americanotably the Chinese to Peru and the Japanese to Brazil. In the wake of this diaspora, artists have recently begun to explore Asian identity in Latin America, notably in several successful documentary and fiction film productions from the region. The presence, for the first time, of a Latin American pavilion at the Beijing Art Expo 2013 also points to the increasing recognition of a centuries-old dialogue in the visual arts. So too does the \"Latin American Artists in Asia\" network, whose members practise in fields from sculpture to photography and digital art. This session will cover a broad historical period, and adopt a variety of methodological approaches. Key issues to be considered include (post) national identity, materiality and its relationship to place, and the opportunities and complications offered by digital technologies.   26. Student Session: On Creative Labour  Session Convenors: Sophie Frost (University of Aberdeen) and Tilo Reifenstein (Manchester Metropolitan University), Student Members' Committee of the AAH  Any definition of \"creative labour'\"is necessarily impermanent and subject to contestation. Academics utilise it to challenge the doctrine of creativity' and the creative industries', while the corporate realm appropriates the term in accord with neo-liberal visions of employees as \"creative capital.\" Transecting work environments as varied as trading floors, hospitals, advertising offices, and art galleries, such debates have begun to inform contemporary understandings of what exactly constitutes artistic practice, as well as interrogate how we construct art history in light of what it means to be a \"creative.\" This session seeks to critique the concept of creative labour as much as entertain the potential use value of the rhetoric of the creative industries. Thematically, creative labour engages theoretical and political issues, but also provides a viewpoint to interrogate empirical or historical instances of creative practice. As a younger generation of the creative workforce faces the realities of an uncertain future, the exploitation of unpaid internships and the dubious viability of radical art collectives, what future does creative labour offer? How can this concept be used to illuminate art historical practices? Is creative labour necessarily precarious because it opposes the \"value\" of self-realisation of a named, free individual and the uniform anonymity of work? We are equally interested to examine the past, present and future of the creative labourer and the social and psychological implications of creativity in the workplace. What is the democratic potential of creative labour and does it have political and ecological import?   28. Surface Affects and Shiny Things: Bringing meaning to light   Nic Maffei (Norwich University of the Arts, Victoria Mitchell (Norwich University of the Arts) and Marcia Pointon (Norwich University of the Arts)  The visual qualities of a surface that shines are such as to attract or distract the eyes, which themselves are often attributed with gleaming, shining or glinting. The silkiness of high polish invites tactile attention too, or deters for fear of spoiling. Shine may materialise through use or careful positioning of an object. It is often not inherent in a material but may be derived from working up a shine. Within art, design and architecture, materials (metal, plastic, glass, fabric, wood, paint) and processes, often labour-intensive (polishing, burnishing, glazing), can combine to reveal shine. The manifestations of shininess can imply bodies in motion and individual subjectivity, while the gloss of film or magazines points to a more socially pervasive \"look.\" Although dependent on specular-reflective properties of light and absorbency of materials, reflective patina or sheen is often intentionally sought, in order to generate affect or effect. This session addresses the cultural, historical, critical and often paradoxical meanings of \"shine\" as this pertains to the making, using or viewing of objects and surfaces. Depending on context, shininess might suggest religious or poetic allusion, sensory engagement, luminosity, spectacle, desire, cheapness, cleanliness, protection, health, wealth and perhaps also disgust (as in the surface of slime). Shininess was held in high regard in Byzantine and Anglo-Saxon art, as also for many designers of the mid-20th century. Spurred on by fashion, the superficial nature of shininess has been linked to postmodern theory on late-capitalism. We seek papers that engage with such issues in relation to any period, reflecting a range of practices and perspectives.   30. Thinking Images  Session Convenors: Hanneke Grootenboer (University of Oxford), Anita Paz (University of Oxford) and Lucy Whelan (University of Oxford)  This session explores the rising interest in art as a mode of thinking, apparent in academic writing as well as artistic practice. Images have long been seen as thought-provoking or as tools for contemplation. However, recent years have revealed a shift towards giving art works agency to think. Czanne and Klee famously declared that they thought through painting, while Jean-Luc Godard claimed cinema as a mode of thinking. More recently, Jacques Rancire declared photography as thoughtful, while Ron Burnett's How Images Think links the digital image's thinking power to the technology from which it derives. This session will examine how images might be capable of thinking. Questions to be pursued include: By what mechanisms do images think? What visual language do they use or create? How do they shape thought? How is a mode of thought specific to a particular mediumfilm (stills), installation art, sculptureor a particular cultureChinese Ming painting, Buddhist imagery? What are the political implications of ascribing thought processes to visual materials? This session intends to establish a genealogy of the thinking image, and encourages papers addressing these and related questions through a variety of approaches, media and ideas.   32. Visualising Nuclear Culture  Session Convenor: Catherine Jolivette (Missouri State University)  2016 sees the 60th anniversary of the world's first nuclear power station. Since the opening of Calder Hall in Cumberland in 1956, atomic power has been viewed both as the promise of clean, efficient energy for the future and as a volatile threat, witnessed by disasters such as those at Windscale (1957), Three Mile Island (1979) and most recently Fukushima (2011). Since Ernest Walton and John Cockcroft first split the atom in 1932, nuclear science has opened up new visual realms for artists to explore, but it also unleashed the annihilating power of the atom bomb as utilised to devastating effect in the catastrophic attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. The development of the even more powerful hydrogen bomb raised the stakes higher, with the spectre of Mutually Assured Destruction culminating in the Cold War Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 as the world waited on the brink of nuclear retaliation. The history of the 20th century has been a history of nuclear power, and while artists have embraced the iconic forms and societal potential of the atom they have also protested the development of nuclear weapons and the negative environmental consequences of nuclear energy. This session invites papers that explore the impact of nuclear technology, weapons and/or energy on any aspect of the visual arts and culture including, but not limited to, painting, sculpture, photography, graphic design, time-based art, and architecture. Cross disciplinary approaches, and papers that engage with international exchanges of ideas and images, are particularly welcome.   back to page index     \"Artistic Interventions: Histories, Cartographies and Politics in Asia\"   Hong Kong Baptist University  Hong Kong  30-31 March 2015   [from \" Artistic Interventions ,\" 9/4/14]   This call for papers and art projects is for PhD students and artists to submit their abstract for a two-day workshop to be held on 30 and 31 March 2015 at Hong Kong Baptist University in collaboration with the International Institute for Asian Studies, and the Amsterdam Centre for Globalisation Studies (University of Amsterdam).   The workshop aims to move beyond the traditional paradigms of western scientific representation by re-examining the fundamental concepts of time and space in the construction of knowledge of and from Asia. During the first day of the workshop, leading scholars in the field of history and cultural studies, and artists from different localities in Asia, including Hong Kong, Japan, Indonesia and South Korea, will interrogate the politics of history and cartography and explore new possible forms of knowledge.   This call for proposals concerns the second day, during which PhD students and artists are invited to present and discuss their work with these scholars. Limited funding for travel and accommodation is available for them. The workshop will be free of charge.   Applications should include:  - an abstract of your paper, max. 300 words  - a one-page CV, including contact details of two referees.   Applications should be sent by 15 November 2014 to Ms. Miyan Cheung c/o Dr. Chow Yiu Fai. Selected candidates will be notified by 15 December 2014.   The Artistic Intervention workshop aims to critically interrogate prevailing categorizations of the history and cartography of Asia as institutionalized in Western humanities and open up alternative and new forms of knowledge and practices. During two days we will discuss the fundamental concepts of time and space in the construction of knowledge of and from Asia. While area studies continue the endeavors of knowledge production, its inevitably intricate connections with national histories and geographies are increasingly foregrounded. Knowledge of Asia is still very much constructed by temporal narratives as vigorously and imaginatively as by spatial fixations: in other words, by their histories and geographies. Given that national histories are often deeply entrenched in authoritative discourses that maintain the imagined boundaries of the nation-state, and thereby erase or silence other possible histories and geographies, Prasenjit Duara's call to rescue historyand geography, we addfrom the nation remains as urgent as ever.   We think of the arts, the role of artists, artist-activists and artist run spaces, as a potential rescue tool, capable of moving beyond traditional paradigms of Western scientific representation. The workshop aims to question how artistic practices can help reimagine both time and space in the context of Asia, when put into an intimate dialogue with area studies and related methodologies and disciplines, such as anthropology, art history, cultural studies and so on. The alleged rise of Asia feeds into different nationalisms in the region and beyond, making such reimaginations even more urgent. Its dependency on a meta-discourse on development and modernity are resonances of concepts that are deeply entrenched in social Darwinism, making this discourse on \"the rise of Asia\" all the more complicated, especially in its denial of human complexity and a human craving for aesthetic and political aspirations.   The workshop seeks to probe into artistic and activist practices that proffer alternate histories, as well as processes that present different mappings of the world, the country or the city; these will be put in dialogue with area studies knowledge production that also seeks to destabilize existing cartographies and historical accounts. A transnational and diasporic remapping of Asia, in conjunction with exploring its multiple histories, holds the potential to question if not undermine emerging nationalisms and prevailing reifications of the idea of \"national cultures.\"   Confirmed speakers:  - Zheng Bo (City University of Hong Kong)  - Zoe Butt (Sn Art, Ho Chi Minh City)  - Tiffany Chung (artist, Ho Chi Minh City)  - Xing Danwen (artist, Beijing)  - Gridthiya Gaweewong (Jim Thompson Art Center, Bangkok)  - Edwin Jurrins (University of Melbourne)  - Anson Mak (Hong Kong Baptist University; artist)  - Eva Man (Hong Kong Baptist University)  - Tozer Pak Sheung-Chuen (artist, Hong Kong)  - Y-Dang Troeung (City University of Hong Kong)   Organisers:  - Sadiah Boonstra (International Institute for Asian Studies)  - Yiu Fai Chow (Hong Kong Baptist University)  - Jeroen de Kloet (University of Amsterdam)  - Viet L (California College of the Arts)   back to page index     \"L'artiste comme thoricien [The artist as theoretician]    Institut national d'histoire de l'art (INHA)  Paris, France  14 February 2015   [from H-Arthist , 9/29/14]   Selon un schma hrit de la Renaissance les artistes se font  l'occasion thoriciens de leur propre pratique (Vinci, Alberti). Leurs  crits revtent alors des formes trs diffrentes : essais, critiques,  mmoires, notes, carnets, romans, etc. Ce modle a t repris et  accentu partir de la fin du 19e sicle par les avant-gardes:  l'artiste, l'gal des scientifiques, en vient ainsi laborer des  programmes thoriques (de Seurat au minimalisme, en passant par le  Bauhaus, le constructivisme ou l'art conceptuel). Le milieu des annes  1960 voit mme s'difier un modle d'artiste comme thoricien. Un peu  partout en Occident, l'art conceptuel, en tablissant une quivalence  entre l'art et le discours sur l'art, donne notamment pour objectif  l'art de se dfinir par lui-mme, alors que des artistes comme Daniel  Buren insistent sur le rle de thoricien de l'artiste, lui-mme  dclarant que la thorie est indissociable de sa propre pratique .  Ces artistes ont en commun de revendiquer une volont de prendre  position face l'hgmonie du discours institutionnel et de contrer  les catgorisations qu'il impose.   Depuis la fin des annes 1970, ce modle semble tre en perte de  vitesse. En revanche, d'autres modles apparaissent qui voient les  artistes emprunter des lments thoriques et mthodologiques une  varit de champs disciplinaires: l'artiste-ethnographe,  l'artiste-archiviste ou documentaliste, l'artiste-producteur,  l'artiste-narrateur, l'artiste-cartographe, l'artiste-scientifique,  etc. Dans ces nouvelles postures, l'artiste s'intresse davantage des  connaissances appliques qu' des laborations spculatives et laisse  de ct l'ide d'une matrise complte des savoirs abstraits au profit  de connaissances plus pratiques.   La question thorique occupe une place importante dans la pratique des  artistes contemporains. La thorie, qu'elle soit produite par les  artistes ou importe au sein de leurs activits, soutient-elle  ncessairement leur pratique? Quelles sont les formes qu'elle peut  prendre et les supports sur lesquels elle se dveloppe? L'objet de  cette journe d'tude sera d'interroger les diffrentes facettes et  enjeux que recouvre l'activit thoricienne pour un artiste, les  consquences sur sa pratique, ainsi que sur le statut de l'artiste  lui-mme.   Axes de rflexion possibles:  - L'interrogation ou la remise en cause de la figure et du statut de  l'artiste par le modle de l'artiste-thoricien  - L'artiste comme chercheur: la question de l'articulation  thorie-pratique  - L'artiste-thoricien vs. l'artiste utilisant des thories  - Les formes et supports de l'activit thorique des artistes (crit,  oral, film, entretien, confrence-performance)  - Les sujets abords: thorie artistique et dbordement du champ de  l'art (sciences dures, philosophie, sciences humaines, psychanalyse...)   - La pratique artistique comme terrain de recherche  - La spcificit de la thorie artistique par rapport d'autres  thories  - L'imitation et la critique de la posture de l'artiste-thoricien   Dmarches artistiques pouvant tre prises en compte : Joseph Kosuth, Robert Morris, Luis Camnitzer, Eric Duyckaerts, Marcel  Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, Joseph Beuys, Mario Garcia Torres, Fred  Forest, Herv Fischer, David Antin, Bureau d'tude, Claire Fontaine,  Frank Leibovici, Pierre Leguillon, Aurlien Froment, Mark Dion, Tomas  Saraceno, Carsten Hller   Cet appel contribution a pour finalit une journe d'tude et une  publication au sein d'un numro thmatique de Marges .

Critical Readings of Exhibition History\"   [from H-Arthist , 9/30/14]   \"It is now widely accepted that the art history of the second half of  the twentieth century is no longer a history of artworks, but a history  of exhibitions.\" -- Florence Derieux, \"Introduction,\" in Harald Szeemann, Individual  Methodology (Zurich, 2007)   For this thematic issue #2 of Stedelijk Studies we welcome essays that  critically reflect on the contemporary re-readings of art and art  history through the history of exhibitions. In recent years, the re-staging of exhibitions has become a popular  practice in museums. Think of the Recollections series as part of the  temporary opening of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in 2010/2011 and  the precise re-enactment of When Attitude Becomes Form at Fondazione  Prada in Venice during the 2013 Biennale. Moreover, Afterall Publishers  launched a series of publications devoted exclusively to contextual and  critical readings of key exhibitions of the past decades. How are the exhibitions that are being re-staged and/or written about,  being selected? What are the criteria of selection, in other words: how  is the canon of exhibition history being established? What does the  current trend of exhibition re-enactment add to the art historical  appreciation of these exhibitions? And what does it imply for the field  of art history and curating/exhibition making? Are we simply  re-iterating an already written art history, or does exhibition history  allow for other and/more critical tools to approach history. In other  words: what is the surplus value of the turn to exhibition history in  both theory and curatorial practice? We invite contributors to critically reflect on the influence of the  rereading of museum exhibitions on the canon of modern and contemporary  art, and the (im)possibilities of rewriting art history through the  re-enactment of historical exhibitions.   Please submit your abstract before November 15, 2014 .  Deadline for the essay will be February 15, 2015.   The theme issue \"Re-writing or Re-affirming the Canon? Critical Readings  of Exhibition History\" will be edited and curated by Dr. Sandra Kisters  and Dr. Linda S. Boersma from Utrecht University, The Netherlands.

These two fields have traditionally   defined themselves in opposition to one another, with   the former focused on an area-studies, nationally and   politically oriented approach, and the latter emphasizing epistemological categories, including ethnicity and citizenship,   that drew mainly on the history of the United States.   The past decade however has seen a series of rapprochements   in which, for instance, categories \"belonging\" to Asian   American Studies (ethnicity, race, diaspora) have been   applied with increasing success to studies of Asia.   For example Asian Studies has responded to the postnational   turn in the humanities and social sciences by becoming increasingly open to rethinking its national and regional insularities, and to work that pushes, often literally,   on the boundaries of Asia as both a place and a concept.   At the same time, Asian American Studies has become   increasingly aware of the ongoing importance of Asia   to the Asian American experience, and thus more open   to work that is transnational or multilingual, as well as to forms of scholarship that challenge the US-centrism   of concepts governing the Asian diaspora.   Verge showcases scholarship on \"Asian\" topics from across the humanities  and humanistic social sciences, while recognizing that the changing scope  of \"Asia\" as a concept and method is today an object of vital critical  concern. Deeply transnational and transhistorical in scope, Verge  emphasizes thematic and conceptual links among the disciplines and  regional/area studies formations that address Asia in a variety of  particularist (national, subnational, individual) and generalist  (national, regional, global) modes Responding to the ways in which  large-scale social, cultural, and economic concepts like the world, the  globe, or the universal (not to mention East Asian cousins like tianxia or  datong) are reshaping the ways we think about the present, the past and  the future, the journal publishes scholarship that occupies and enlarges  the proximities among disciplinary and historical fields, from the ancient  to the modern periods. The journal emphasizes multidisciplinary  engagement&mdash;a crossing and dialogue of the disciplines that does not erase  disciplinary differences, but uses them to make possible new conversations  and new models of critical thought.   Issue 1: OPEN ISSUE   The history of scholarship on Asian America, when juxtaposed with the  fields of Asian Studies, reminds us how much nations, national movements,  and other forms of national development continue to exert powerful effects  on the world in which we live. Such movements also remind us of the  importance of inter-nationalism, of the kinds of networks that can spring  up between states and which can work to disrupt the smooth passage of the  planet into a utopian post-national future. The growing interest in the  global and the transnational across disciplines thus brings the various  Asia-oriented fields and disciplines&mdash;history and literature, Asia and  Asian America, East and South, modern and premodern&mdash;closer together. This  inaugural issue seeks to feature work that illustrates the diverse  engagements across disciplines (literature, history, sociology, art  history, political science, geography) and fields (Asian Studies and Asian  American Studies) that are possible once we begin thinking about the  possible convergences and divergences such divisions have traditionally  represented. We welcome a range of perspectives; featured contributors  include Ien Ang, Dean Chan, Alexandra Chang, Catherine Ceniza Choy, Magnus  Fiskejo, Pika Ghosh, Evelyn Hu-Dehart, Yunte Huang, Suk-young Kim, Joachim  Kurtz, Meera Lee, Wei Li, Colleen Lye, Sucheta Mazumdar, Tak-wing Ngo,  Haun Saussy, David Palumbo-Liu, Sheldon Pollack, Shuh-mei Shih, Eleanor  Ty, and Jeffrey Wasserstrom. Submission deadline: February 1, 2014 .   Issue 2: COLLECTING (edited by Jonathan Abel and Charlotte Eubanks)   As a construct and product of powerful institutions from empires, to  nation-states, museums, to universities, Asia has long been formulated at  the level of the collection. Whether through royal court poetry  compilations, colonial treasure hunters, art historians, bric a brac shop  keepers, or librarians of rare archives, the role of collecting and  classification has been deeply connected not only to definitions of what  counts as Asia and who can be considered Asian, but also to how Asia  continues to be configured and re-configured today. With this in mind, this special issue of Verge seeks to collect papers on  the history, finance, psychology, politics and aesthetics of collecting  Asia in Asia and beyond. This collection hopes not only to bring into  relief how \"Asia\" has been created but also to promote new definitions of  Asia. What, for instance, are the historical implications of government-sponsored poetry anthologies in Mughal India, Heian-era Japan,  or 20th century North Korea? What do the contents of treasure-houses--at  Angkor Wat, Yasukuni Shrine, or Vishwanath -tell us about evolving  concepts of art and of the elasticity of cultural and national contours?  When did Japan become a geographical base for the collection of Asia? Who  collects Chinese books? How has Indian art been defined by curatorial  practices? Why did South Korea begin to collect oral histories in the  1990s? What politics lie behind the exhibition of mainland Chinese posters  in Taiwan? How much money do cultural foundations spend on maintaining  collections? Where are the limits of Asian collections in geographical and  diasporic terms? How do constructions of these collections impact our  views of the collective, whether of Tibetan exiles in Dharamsala, Japanese  internment camps in Indonesia, global Chinatowns, or adherents of new  Asian religions in the Americas and former Soviet Republics? This issue is interested in the various cultures of collecting Asia and  collecting Asians, in the many politics of collecting, in the odd  financial restrictions on collectors, in the psychology of collecting, in  the anthropology of how communities form around collected objects, and in  the sociology around collective histories. Submission deadline: August 1, 2014   Issue 3: ASIAN URBANISMS AND URBANIZATIONS  (edited by Madhuri Desai and Shuang Shen)   In the contemporary age of globalization, the city has gained new  importance and attention as a center of information industry, a node of  transnational and translocal networks, and a significant site of capital,  labor migration and culture (Saskia Sassen, Manuel Castells and David  Harvey). While this renewed interest in the city both perpetuates and  revises theories of the city as a metaphor of modernity (Walter Benjamin,  Georg Simmel), it also opens up questions regarding the uniqueness and  relevance of earlier cities and their experience of urbanization. When we  move us away from Eurocentric understandings of modernity and time, it  becomes increasingly possible to study non-European urbanisms in the past  and at present with theoretical rigor and historical specificity. For this  special issue, we invite submissions (around 8000 words) that explore  urbanism as a site of comparison and connection among various Asian  locales and beyond. We are interested in not just studies of Asian cities  and their urban experience but also how \"Asia\" has been imagined both  historically and contemporaneously, through urbanism and urbanization, and  how \"Asia\" as a term of travel is registered in the urban space. This  special issue will draw attention to the following questions: As cities  become increasingly connected and similar to each other, how do they  express their distinct identities as well as articulate their unique  histories? Besides circulation, movement, and networks that have been much  emphasized in contemporary studies of the city, how do borders,  checkpoints, and passwords function in urban contexts? How does the city  articulate connections between the local, the national, and the  transnational? How does the Asian experience of urbanization and ideas  surrounding Asian urbanism revise, rethink, and in some cases revive  Asia's colonial past? What does the Western perspective on some Asian  cities as unprecedented and futuristic tells us about the imagination of  Asia in the global context? How do migrant and ethnic communities  negotiate with and redefine the public space of the city? How is the urban  public shared or fragmented by co-existing ethnic and religious  communities? How is the rising cosmopolitanism of these cities challenged  through migration and sharply defined ethnic and religious identities? We  invite submissions that address these questions within the context of  Early modern, colonial and contemporary urbanisms and urbanizations. Deadline: April 1, 2015   Issue 4: ASIAN EMPIRES & IMPERIALISM (edited by On-cho Ng and Erica  Brindley)   The nature of Asian empires in the past, as well as the definition of  imperialism in contemporary times, is a topic of ongoing discussion among  scholars from a wide range of fields. In this special issue ofVerge, we  will explore a cluster of issues concerning the mechanics and influence of  empires, imperial authority, and imperial types of influence over  indigenous cultures and frontiers in Asia, as well as their diasporas  abroad and in the USA. We invite submissions that address one or some of  the following questions: How did various imperial efforts interact with  local concerns to shape the history of cross-cultural interactions in this  region? How did imperial regimes propose to solve the issue of a  multi-ethnic empire? What were the roles of specific geographic and  economic spheres in Asia (such as those of nomadic, agricultural,  maritime, high altitude or lowland, and far-flung/diasporic cultures) in  contributing to the distinctive quality of certain empires? How do certain  characteristics of imperial administration and control in Asia compare to  those of imperial states in other regions of the world? In addition to  questions concerning the long history of Asian imperialism and comparisons  with other empires, we also solicit submissions that speak to questions  concerning contemporary Asian diasporas and their reactions to various  forms of imperialism in the modern age. Questions might address such  topics as \"Yellow Peril\" fears about Asian cultural imperialism; Japanese  internment camps as a US response to Japanese imperial expansion in the  Pacific; the Tibetan diaspora in South Asia and the Americas as a reaction  to contemporary Chinese imperialism; Vietnamese responses to French,  Chinese, or American imperialisms, and the treatment of Japanese-Americans  in Hawaii in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor.

The editors seek submissions   of innovative interpretive analyses in all fields. Essays may be drawn from   any humanities, social science, or other fields including history, literature,   philosophy, environment, psychology, sociology, fine arts, language, economics,   business, and medicine. A palimpsest is a manuscript on which the original text   has been rubbed or scraped away and written over, with shadows and nuances of   the original text sometimes visible underneath. As a metaphor for our journal,   a palimpsest describes the state of text in the information age: shadows, traces,   and pluralities of texts shaped by the input of many minds and voices. There   is no pristine text but nuances of other texts visible underneath and written   over. As a critical metaphor, Palimpsest is meant to suggest that all areas   of study have multiple layers of meaning, which the scholar may discover by   \"rubbing away\" the old to reveal new insight. Palimpsest seeks to establish   a dynamic forum for interdisciplinary discourse in the search of new paradigms   and ways of seeing.   Papers may be submitted for   consideration using any citation format; the final format for those accepted   will be submitted in a modified version of the Chicago Manual of Style .   The author's name should appear only on the title page and in the file name   of the submitted document (jones.doc). Manuscript length is standard, from 6,000   to 8,000 words.

JCACS publishes scholarly articles   in Turkish and English from all over the world. The Editorial Office of the   JCACS is in the International Strategic Research Organisation (ISRO) central   building in Ankara, Turkey. However the journal is an independent publication   in terms of scientific research and the editors decide its publication policy.     JCACS focuses on legal, political,   sociological, cultural, social, religious, anthropological and economic studies   regarding the Central Asia, Caucasus and neighbouring states' (Turkey, Iran,   Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, China, Mongolia, Russia) and regions' (Black Sea,   South Asia, Middle East, Far East) relations with the Central Asia and the Caucasus.     The journal encourages interdisciplinary   studies. Manuscripts submitted to JCACS should be original and challenging,   and should not be under consideration by another publication at the time of   submission.   We also welcome short pieces   on recent developments and review articles.   Articles submitted for consideration   of publication are subject to peer review. The editorial board and editors take   consideration whether submitted manuscript follows the rules of scientific writing.   The appropriate articles are then sent to two referees known for their academic   reputation in their respective areas.   The Editors and referees   use three-step guidelines in assessing submissions:     i) Literary quality: Writing   style, usage of the language, organisation (paragraphing, syntax, flow etc.)      ii) Use of references.

Why a new journal?   Why now?   We believe it is time to   explore the state of feminist scholarship at the turn of the new century, and   we see the endeavor as part of a larger question of where feminism itself is   heading. For example, we ask whether it still makes sense to talk of the \"waves\"   of feminism. If so, what is the status of the third wave? Is there a post-third   wave? We wish to encourage a discussion of feminist thought for the twenty-first   century. What are its directions today, and what relationship does it sustain   with the foundations laid down by feminist inquiry and action in earlier centuries?   We aim to publish work that explores the multiple theoretical paradigms and   political agendas of contemporary and historical feminist scholarship and the   potential intersections and tensions between these paradigms and agendas. We   are especially interested in examining productive controversies and divergences   between local and global contexts of feminism. We also welcome submissions that  focus on feminist pedagogies and activism.   Please visit the submissions   page to see our guidelines for authors and our contact page for contact   information for the JFS .

Art Review provides   a broad field for various approaches and arguments. It covers not only essays   on art history, art criticism and aesthetic theory, but also interdisciplinary   art studies such as philosophical, psychological, anthropological, semiotic,   sociological, politico-economic, or any other approaches so long as it aims   at a enlightening interpretation of art.   Art Review advocates   the idea of \"BIG ART,\" with no constrains on the genres and subject of the art   to be studied. The genres covered not only could be traditional art (painting,   sculpture, architecture, calligraphy, music, dance, drama, folk art, ethnic   art, cinema, etc), but also any form of art so long as you sufficiently argue   that it is art. For instance, Art Review expects studies on \"industrial\"   art such as advertisement, packaging, fashion, toys and gifts design, etc. Art   Reviewparticularly welcomes studies on environment art, such as landscape, gardening,   decoration, and digital art design such as video game and animation.   Contributions should follow   the APA style.

So and Madeleine Zelin   Editorial Board:   Prasenjit Duara (National University of   Singapore)   Wang Fan-sen (Academia   Sinica)   Rana Mitter (Oxford University)   Joshua Fogel (York University, Toronto)     John Makeham (Australian National   University)   Charles Armstrong (Columbia University)     Tomobe Kenichi (Osaka University)     The economic emergence of   East Asia--first Japan, followed by the Little Dragons and Southeast Asia, and   the recent rise of China, has produced a paradigm shift in the study of the   East Asian regions. Not only has an earlier understanding based on adaptation   to Western models given way to a re-evaluation of the interface between the   local and the global, but scholarship itself has become increasingly transnational.   This is evidenced in hitherto unseen levels of transnational collaboration,   conferences and research programs, and the creation of on-line archives and   virtual intellectual communities. East Asia, broadly defined to include both   northeast and Southeast Asia, has contributed greatly to this shift. This series   aims at providing a platform for the products of this scholarship, encouraging   interdisciplinary, transnational and comparative research on the countries and   peoples of the East Asian region, and their regional and global interactions.   In an effort to reflect the full range of collaborations that are now taking   place across the globe this series will feature monographs and edited volumes   as well as translated works that explore the global processes of change in East   Asia and the historical role of East Asia in the creation of the institutions,   ideas, and practices that constitute our contemporary world.   Brill welcomes submissions   of book proposals and manuscripts for consideration for inclusion in the series.   Submissions should be in English and can be sent to the attention of the Series   Editors, Billy So , Madeleine   Zelin , or the Publishing Editor, Qin   Higley .   back to page index      RadicalAesthetics-RadicalArt     [from AAH ,   1/23/12]   Submissions are invited from   authors (artists and scholars) who can make a provocative contribution to this   book series. We are particularly looking for further titles in the area of socio-political   aesthetics or global aesthetics.   The RadicalAesthetics-RadicalArt   (RaRa) series of books expands the parameters of art and aesthetics in a creative   and meaningful way beyond visual traditions. Encompassing the multisensory,   collaborative, participatory and transitory practices that have developed over   the last twenty years, Radical Aesthetics-Radical Art is an innovative and revolutionary   take on the intersection between theory and practice. The series aims to:     critique conventional   approaches to thinking about art practice and aesthetics   reconsider the interrelationships   between theories and art practice on equal terms   provide a useful resource   to assist research and provoke discussion   address current issues   in response to contemporarycontexts   encourage an interdisciplinary   approach to discussion   survey recent and current   material and debate.

Ein erster berblick ber   vielfltige inhaltliche und formale Varianten von Beziehungen zwischen literarischem   Text und gemaltem Bild ergab eine Unterteilung in komplementre und symbiotische   \"Schreibweisen\". Vertiefend und erweiternd soll nunmehr drei Anstzen einer   Betrachtung Raum gegeben werden:     1. Der Untersuchung \"komplementrer\"   (kompensatorischer) Beziehungen zwischen Text und Bild, innerhalb derer sich   Bild und Text nicht entsprechen, sich nicht ergnzen oder erklren (wie Bibelillustrationen,   Emblemata, Merkbilder), aber dennoch aufeinander bezogen sind, in Abhngigkeit   stehen bzw. sich zu einer Synthese oder Symbiose erweitern. Es geht um dialektisch   angelegte berschreitungen der Grenzen von Ausdrucksweisen im jeweiligen Medium,   indem komplementre (kompensatorische) Ausdruckspotentiale der jeweils anderen   Gattung einbezogen werden. \"Sinn\" oder \"Bedeutung\" des schriftstellerisch-bildnerischen   Verbundes oszillieren zwischen den beiden Medien, ergeben sich aus der gegenseitigen   Beeinflussung und Erweiterung. Gefragt wird hier nach intermedialen Verschrnkungen   sowie ob diese mglicherweise genderspezifisch zu differenzieren sind. Keines   der Medien ist vorrangig; sie stehen in einer nicht-hierarchischen Beziehung   zueinander. Beispiele fr gattungsbergreifende Fusionen finden sich bei Else   Lasker-Schler, Unica Zrn, Friederike Mayrker, Frida Kahlo.   2. Ein weiterer Ansatz   der Betrachtung soll sich auf die Verbindung von getrennt entstandenen Texten   und Bildern beziehen, die allerdings kulturell verhafteten Prinzipien einer   Wechselwirkung unterlagen. Hier wren geistes- und kulturgeschichtlichen (literarischen,   philosophischen, knstlerischen) Zusammenhngen nachzugehen, transmediale   Einflsse und bereinstimmungen zu erkennen, d.h. auch ein Netzwerk von Bezgen   (anhand von Quellenstudien) zu erarbeiten. Es knnte gezeigt werden, wie Werke   der bildenden Kunst bzw. der Literatur nicht selten unlsbar im Zusammenhang   der aktuellen Kulturszene (ent-)stehen, wie hier auch (weibliche) Genealogien   (Bezge zwischen LiteratInnen und KnstlerInnen) auszumachen sind. Vergleichende   Analysen von Texten und Bildern zielen darauf ab, ihre kulturelle, auch genderspezifische   Zusammengehrigkeit festzustellen. Herausragend sind hier die Beitrge von   Reinhard Brandt (Philosophie in Bildern) ber u.a. Las Meninas von   Velazquez oder Die Schule von Athen von Raffael.   3. Darber hinaus fordern   \"analogische\" Entsprechungen zur Diskussion heraus: Selbst wenn Text und Bild   unvergleichbarscheinen, mglicherweise verschiedenen Epochen angehren, knnen   sie auf analoge Ausdrucksintentionen verweisen. Als Beispiel sei die Darstellung   des Ehebruchs in Madame Bovary genannt, den Flaubert literarisch verhllt,   ebenso wie Jan Vermeer van Delft in seinem Bild Das Glas Wein den Moralbruch   der Verfhrung der Dame durch den Kavalier. Der Fokus der Betrachtung lge   hier auf-eventuell auch genderspezifisch zu differenzierende-Darstellungstechniken   zum Beispiel des Unausgesprochenen oder Nicht-Dargestellten. Fragen ergeben   sich, wie anhand der medial zu unterscheidenden Darstellungsweisen ein gleicher   knstlerischer Ausdruck (z.B. des \"Innehaltens\", einer \"Anspannung\", eines   \"Moments hchster Dramatik\") erzeugt wird. Bei einem solchen Vorgehen wren   die unterschiedlichen Ausdruckspotentiale von Literatur und bildender Kunst   exemplarisch an ihrer zeitlosen Gegenberstellung bewut zu machen. Die sich   ergebenden Parallelen beruhen nicht zwingend auf einer wechselseitigen Rezeption,   vielmehr auf Konstanten bzw. Grundstrukturen der literarischen und bildknstlerischen   Produktion.

Schimmelpfennig , 2/9/12]   Theoretical Studies in   Literature and Art ( TSLA ), which was initiated in 1980 and published   bimonthly, is one of the most highly ranked academic journals in China that   publish original research articles in arts and humanities, especially in literary   theory. From 2012 year onwards, TSLA will publish original academic articles   that are written in English. Articles that deal with any issues in literary   theory, critical theory, aesthetics, philosophy of art, cultural studies will   be welcome. Discussions of Asian issues, particularly issues concerning China   are encouraged but not required.   The length of papers should   be about 6000-12000 words and in MLA format. The papers will be peer-reviewed,   and the final decision about publication will be notified in four months. Authors   can send e-mails to inquire the status if they receive no feedback in two months.     Queries and contributions   can be sent to tsla@vip.126.com . Contributions   must be sent as attachments in either rtf(s) or Word 97-2003 file(s) with \"contribution   from xxx (i.e. your name)\" as the subject heading.   back to page index      Journal   of the Royal Asiatic Society China    [courtesy of N. Schmid , 1/21/14]   The Journal of the Royal   Asiatic Society China in Shanghai publishes original research articles of up to 10,000 words (shorter articles are also welcome) on Chinese culture and society, past and present, with a focus on mainland China. Original articles, which will be peer-reviewed, must be previously unpublished, and make a contribution to the field. The Journal also publishes timely reviews of books on all aspects of Chinese history, culture and society.    The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society China is a continuation of the original scholarly publication of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, the Journal of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society , published from 1858 to 1948. The Journal proudly maintains the level of academic standards and innovative research that marked its standing as the preeminent Western sinological journal in China for nearly a hundred years.   The deadline for submissions is April 15, 2014 .   Inquiries may be sent to the Honorary Journal Editor, Dr Neil Schmid, editor@royalasiaticsociety.org.cn .   back to page index      Asian   Ethnology   [from H-ASIA, 1/26/12]   Dear Colleagues:   I have recently agreed to   assume the co-editorship of the journal Asian Ethnology . Asian   Ethnology is a semi-annual, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the promotion   of ethnographic and ethnological research on the peoples and cultures of Asia.   Though rendered entirely in English, the journal draws manuscript submissions   from across Asia and Europe as well as North America. Topically, it occupies   a special niche located at the intersection of Anthropology, Folklore, and Asian   Studies. The journal has been particularly instrumental in bringing the important   work of Asian scholars (that is, scholars of Asian nationality) to the attention   of an English readership, thereby helping to mitigate Western domination of   the global academic arena.   Formerly called Asian   Folklore Studies , the journal was founded by Austrian ethnologist Matthias   Eder in Beijing, China in 1942. Under threat from the Maoist takeover in 1949,   Eder relocated to Nanzan University in Nagoya, Japan, from where the journal   has been based ever since. We are especially interested in submissions on the   following topics:     narratives, performances,   and other forms of cultural representations   popular religious concepts   vernacular approaches to health and healing   local knowledge   collective memory and uses of the past   material culture   cultural transformations in diasporas   transnational flows   ecological issues     Generally, each issue of   the journal contains at least one or two articles on the South Asian region,   so we encourage you to submit your work to us. We also encourage thematic issues   (e.g., an issue on Chinese folklore guest edited by Thomas DuBois is forthcoming).   More information on the journal can be found on the home   page .   back to page index     \"Studies in Art Historiography\" series   [from H-Arthist ,   4/16/12]   \"Studies   in Art Historiography,\" published by Ashgate, welcomes   contributions from architectural historians. Much recent   historiography has focused on scholars of \"Art History\"   but many of these made considerable contributions to   architectural history, from Heinrich Wlfflin whose   Renaissance und Barock is essentially architectural   history, to Rudolf Wittkower whose impact is usually   assessed in relation to the architectural profession   and Modernist architecture. Cornelius Gurlitt, Geoffrey   Scott, Hans Sedlmayr, Nikolaus Pevsner, Colin Rowe,   Venturi and Scott Brown are just some of the names that   come to mind and Studies in Art Historiography welcomes   proposals for volumes dedicated to relevant themes in   architectural historiography as well as individual studies  of significant figures in the field.   More   information about our book series and submission guidelines  are available at http://arthistoriography.wordpress.com/studies-in-art-historiography-submission-guidelines/ .   back to page index      Nineteenth-Century   Art Worldwide   [from H-Arthist ,   3/3/12]   Digital Humanities Research   and Publication in NCAW    Nineteenth-Century Art Worldwide   has received a grant from the Mellon Foundation for a three-year capacity-building   initiative to maximize the possibilities of the journal electronic delivery.   With this in mind, NCAW is soliciting potential articles that take full advantage   of new web technologies either in the research or the publication phase, or   both. The Mellon grant is intended to help authors in the development phase   of their articles as well as to aid NCAW in the implementation phase. NCAW is   seeking scholarship that engages in one or more of the following, interrelated   areas of investigation:      Data Mining and Analysis :      Use of data analytics programs (e.g., SEASR, Network Workbench) to investigate   connections among particular groups or individuals, such as artists, writers,   art dealers, art markets and other networks of exchange (social networks).   See for example \" Mapping   the Republic of Letters ,\" produced by researchers and technologists at   Stanford University.    Geographic Information   Systems (GIS) and Mapping :   Use of maps in concert with data sets (e.g., depictions of sites, location   of objects, paths of travel) in order to investigate and communicate change   over time and space. The website for the project \" Imago   Urbis: Giuseppe Vasi's Grand Tour of Rome ,\" for example, links Giambattista   Nolli's 1748 map of Rome with vedute created by Vasi, providing insight into   the vedutismo tradition as well as the urban development of Rome in the eighteenth   century.    High-Resolution imaging   and dynamic image presentation :   Use of panoramic and/or high-resolution imagery to view, for example, panoramas,   conservation images (x-ray, infrared reflectography), moving images. The QTVR   panoramas of world architecture produced by Columbia University, are an   example of the kind of image viewing interface that could be used in support   of scholarship on, for example, panorama paintings or large-scale architectural   installations.     Authors are not expected   to have extensive technical expertise themselves; instead NCAW will work with   them to help in realizing the computing aspects of their project. Authors should,   however, be generally knowledgeable about the technological possibilities related   to their project and should be able to articulate how both specific computer-based   research methods and the online publication format connect with the research   questions on which their project focuses. In addition, authors should expect   to collaborate with technical experts on the realization of their projects.   To this end, proposals which give some indication of how authors envision working   with such experts, or which identify specific collaborative partners will be   preferred. Finally, proposals should outline projects which are relatively small-scale,   able to be realized within a time span of about three to six months and requiring   around 100 hours of development work.   Interested contributors are   asked to submit a 500-word abstract that describes the author's (or authors')   project and explains how it fits within the areas described above and why advanced   computing technologies are necessary for conducting this research and/or for   presenting the resulting scholarship. In addition, they are asked to provide   a short CV and a budget. For further information or to submit an application   for funding, e-mail to Petra Chu and   Emily Pugh .   back to page index      Journal   of Art Historiography   [courtesy of R.   Woodfield , 3/6/12]   The Journal   of Art Historiography is an Open Access journal that exists to support   and promote the study of the history and practice of art historical writing.   The historiography of art has been strongly influenced by traditions inaugurated   by Giorgio Vasari, Winckelmann and German academics of the nineteenth and early   twentieth centuries. Consequent to the expansion of universities, museums and   galleries, the field has evolved to include areas outside of its traditional   boundaries.   There is a double danger   that contemporary scholarship will forget its earlier legacy and that it will   neglect the urgency and rigour with which those early debates were conducted.   The earlier legacy remains embedded in normal' practice. More recent art history   also stands in need of its own scrutiny. The journal is committed to studying   art historical scholarship, in its institutional and conceptual foundations,   from the past to the present day in all areas and all periods.   This journal will ignore   the disciplinary boundaries imposed by the Anglophone expression \"art history\"   and allow and encourage the full range of enquiry that encompassed the visual   arts in its broadest sense as well as topics now falling within archaeology,   anthropology, ethnography and other specialist disciplines and approaches. It   will welcome contributions from young and established scholars and is aimed   at building an expanded audience for what has hitherto been a much specialised   topic of investigation.   Besides articles, it will   accept notes, reviews, letters, bibliographical surveys and translations. It   will be published every June and December and include both peer-reviewed and   commissioned contributions.   It will be the first contemporary   journal dedicated specifically to the study of art historiography and its ambition   is to make it the point of first call for scholars and students interested in   that area. It is being supported by the Department of the History of Art at   the University of Birmingham. In collaboration with Ashgate it also publishes   Monographs in Art Historiography .   Editor: R.   Woodfield   back to page index      Journal   of Chinese Military History   [from H-ASIA, 3/11/12]   The Journal of Chinese   Military History , edited by David A. Graff and David Curtis Wright, is   a peer-reviewed semi-annual from Brill that will begin publication in 2012.   It publishes both research articles and book reviews, aiming to fill the need   for a journal devoted specifically to China's martial past. It takes the broadest   possible view of military history, embracing both the study of battles and campaigns   and the broader, social-history oriented approaches that have come to be known   as \"the new military history,\" and it covers all of the Chinese past, from prehistory   through the pre-imperial and imperial periods down to the present day, aiming   to publish a balanced mix of articles that represent a variety of different   approaches and address both the modern and pre-modern periods of Chinese history.   The Journal of Chinese Military History also welcomes comparative and theoretical   work, as well as studies of the military interactions between China and other   states and peoples, including East Asian neighbors such as Japan, Korea, and   Vietnam.   Manuscripts for articles   should be between 7,500 and 20,000 words, double-spaced, and submitted electronically   as MS Word documents.   Article submissions may be   sent to either of the editors:   David A.

The e-journal is embedded in a web-based platform with   functions for collaboration, discussion, and an innovative editing and publishing   process. The semi-annual print issues of Cross-Currents (ISSN: 2158-9666)   published by University of Hawai'i Press feature articles and review essays   that have been selected from the journal's online counterpart for their scholarly   excellence and relevance to the journal's mission.   Cross-Currents offers   its readers up-to-date research findings, emerging trends, and cutting-edge   perspectives concerning East Asian history and culture from scholars in both   English-speaking and Asian language-speaking academic communities. A joint enterprise   of the Research Institute of Korean Studies at Korea University (RIKS) and the   Institute of East Asian Studies at the University of California, Berkeley (IEAS),   Cross-Currents seeks to balance issues traditionally addressed by Western   humanities and social science journals with issues of immediate concern to scholars   in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. This English-language journal includes   scholarship on material from the sixteenth century to the present day that has   significant implications for current models of understanding East Asian history   and culture. An editorial board consisting of established scholars in Asia and   North America provides oversight of the journal, in collaboration with two faculty   co-editors (one each at Korea University and UC Berkeley).   The editors invite online   submissions of original, unpublished research articles. The submission process   and complete information about manuscript preparation can be found at http://cross-currents.berkeley.edu/e-journal/authors .

The new journal Intellectual History aims   to promote this disciplinary field in the world of Chinese-language scholarship,   especially that of Taiwan, though we will also publish English-language articles.   We hope to stimulate thinking about intellectual history in the broadest terms   and to encourage a community of scholars to forge closer ties.   The new journal is interested   in the processes by which individual texts and particular systems of thought   have been made, developed and appropriated in different civilizations at different   periods of history.

Common , das neue Journal fr Kunst im ffentlichen   Raum, soll dieses Defizit beheben, indem es die unterschiedlichen Diskussionen   zu Kunst und ffentlichkeit bndelt und einem breiten Publikum vermittelt.   Kunst im ffentlichen Raum   hat in den letzten Jahren stark an Aufmerksamkeit gewonnen: sie fllt auf, polarisiert,   wird ffentlich (und meist kontrovers!) diskutiert. Dank ihrer Situationsbezogenheit,   Einzigartigkeit und Exklusivitt haben sich knstlerische Projekte im ffentlichen   Raum als vielseitig verwendbares Instrument erwiesen, das von der ffentlichen   Hand und von Privaten als Frdermittel und Aufwertungsmassnahme, fr Standortmarketing   und Werbung, aber auch zur Identittsstiftung eingesetzt werden. Allerdings   sind Informationen zu Kunstprojekten, die in Sphren des ffentlichen stattfinden,   nur mhsam auffindbar. Sie werden nur punktuell publiziert und sind vorwiegend   in der Tagespresse, oder in Eigenpublikationen der Firmen oder der ffentlichen   Hand zu finden. Es fehlt eine Plattform, welche die Projekte und Diskussionen   bndelt und vermittelt.   Common ist ein unabhngiges,   internationales Webjournal, das sich mit Fragen um knstlerische Verfahren in   Sphren des ffentlichen beschftigt. Es schafft eine interdisziplinre Plattform   fr einen kritischen Diskurs ber theoretische und praktische Konzepte von Kunst,   die sich engagiert mit dem ffentlichen auseinandersetzt. Common besteht aus   einem Journalteil mit redaktionell betreuten Beitrgen, in denen AutorInnen   das Thema reflektieren, und aus einem Diskussionsteil, in welchem die Texte   durch ein breites Publikum kommentiert werden und so das Thema erweitert wird.   Common wird von Michle Novak (Editor) herausgegeben; das Journal erscheint   dreimal jhrlich in digitaler Form und einmal als gedruckte Jahresausgabe im   Verlag Buch & Netz.   Common interessiert   sich fr Projekte, die einen Beitrag zur ffentlichen Verhandlung des gemeinsam   Genutzten, des Zusammenlebens, sowie der Funktion, sthetik und Bedeutung des   ffentlichen leisten und darber hinaus eine neue Sicht, ffnungen oder Verschiebungen   der Praxis und der Nutzungen des Stadtraumes beabsichtigen. Experten und Akteure   aus den Bereichen Bildende Kunst, Theater, Musik, Architektur, Landschaftsarchitektur,   Stadtentwicklung, Humangeographie, Soziologie und Philosophie bringen ihre Perspektiven   ein und denken kritisch mit. Common interessiert sich fr eine Durchlssigkeit   der disziplinren Diskurse, fr die Verdichtung und Reibung verschiedener Konzepte   und Herangehensweisen. Wir nehmen aktuelle Tendenzen auf, arbeiten am Topos   des \"ffentlichen Raumes\" und an der entsprechenden Begriffs- und Themenbildung.     Common widmet sich   jeweils einem aktuellen Thema, das breit und kontrovers diskutiert wird. Akteure   und Interessierte aus unterschiedlichen disziplinren Blickwinkeln beschreiben,   reflektieren und diskutieren Projekte, Verfahren, Konzepte und Theorien. Sie   denken mit an der Entwicklung und Umsetzung von neuen Ideen fr den ffentlichen   Gebrauch. Der englische Begriff \"common\" verweist mit seinem Wortsinn auf das   Gemeinsame, Alltgliche und auch Gebruchliche, welches im Sinne der weiteren   Bedeutung des Wortes, der Allmende, reflektiert wird.   Anfang Dezember wird die   erste Nummer des interdisziplinren Onlinejournals C ommonJournal fr Kunst   & ffentlichkeit aufgeschaltet. Aus der Perspektive von Bildender Kunst,   Landschaftsarchitektur, Musik und Theater wird darin zum Thema \"Ideologien der   Kompensationknstlerische Verfahren im ffentlichen Gebrauch\" berichtet und   diskutiert. Wenn knstlerische Projekte im ffentlichen Raum stattfinden und   ffentliche Sphren suchen, dann stehen immer auch Ideologien als Herkunft und   Motivation der engagierten Positionen und Projekte im Hintergrund. Mit welchen   inneren Bildern von Raum, ffentlichkeit und Gesellschaft werden Knstler aktiv?   Welches sind die Konzepte und Entwrfe hinter der Analyse und knstlerischen   Bearbeitung der vorgefundenen Situation? Und was sind die Ziele eines Projektes   am spezifischen Ort? In dieser Ausgabe werden daher Ideologien als Engagement   fr eine jeweils spezifische ffentlichkeit verstanden; und Kompensationen sind   entweder selber Korrektive und Vernderungen oder knnen solche initiieren.   Kompensation wre in diesem Zusammenhang also weniger als Ausgleich, sondern   eher als Erweiterung, Verschiebung, Neubewertung und Vernderung des Vorgefundenen   zu verstehen. Dies ist vielleicht auch der Grund, warum das Kompensatorische   so wunderbare berraschungspotentiale in sich birgt.

The journal also seeks   reviews of recent exhibitions, books and conferences.   The Journal of Curatorial   Studies is an international, peer-reviewed publication that explores the   increasing relevance of curating and exhibitions and their impact on institutions,   audiences, aesthetics and display culture. Inviting perspectives from visual   studies, art history, critical theory, cultural studies and other academic fields,   the journal welcomes a diversity of disciplinary approaches on curating and   exhibitions broadly defined. By catalyzing debate and serving as a venue for   the emerging discipline of curatorial studies, this journal encourages the development   of the theory, practice and history of curating, as well as the analysis of   exhibitions and display culture in general.   Potential topics include:     - critical case studies of curators and exhibitions   - curatorial methodologies and transdisciplinary strategies   - curatorial media (e.g., social, digital and virtual)   - the cultural politics of display   - exhibition typologies and histories   - curatorial ethics and aesthetics   - curating and globalization   - para-curating: artworld rituals, openings, tours, prizes   - curating collections, archives and commissions   - display practices in popular and mass culture   The Journal of Curatorial   Studies publishes three times a year and considers submissions on a continuing   basis.

The series, under the imprint of Peter Lang, was founded in 1984 by the German sinologist Gnther Debon (19212005) and the Canadian comparatist Adrian Hsia (19382010); so far, thirteen books have been published. While the founding editors placed the emphasis on the transfer processes of classical literary works and motifs between cultures, the continuation of their work requires new approaches.   Rather than operate within the conceptual framework of \"cultural dialogue\" between an East and a West viewed as distinct entities, the series editors tend to a view of cultures in contact. Eurosinica is accordingly open for studies and interpretation of authors, personalities, genres and individual works committed to an understanding of humanity as a common source of values which, rather than be impeded by cultural, linguistic or ethnic disparity, are being reshaped and reinvented in different settings.   From the basic concept the series' founders have contributed, we will carry on the approach to literature, the arts and history as transnational narratives emerging out of distinct contextualization and relying on as well as contributing to both the European and the Sinic cultural spheres. We explicitly welcome well-argued innovative interpretations of classical works, as we do historical and translation studies. At a time of ongoing global changes of aesthetic and critical paradigms, Eurosinica does not intend to propose the East-West-paradigm as a last refuge for intellectual cultural conservatism, but rather envisages new critical approaches to the sporadic process of aesthetic and historical interactions (\"contacts\") between formerly allegedly \"separated\" cultural spheres.   Eurosinica expects to publish between one and two volumes annually and aims for a balance between studies of contemporary or ancient focus. It thereby seeks to counter the trend of separating research on classical and modern issues.   Eurosinica will consider manuscripts in European languages. The series editors and board members are scholars at universities in the Baltic and Nordic countries of Europe, as well as in mainland China, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao. They represent the disciplines of comparative literature, cultural studies and history in European and East Asian languages.   As  a series, Eurosinica is directed and managed by AsiaRes,  the Baltic Research  Center for East Asian studies at the University  of Latvia in Riga and the Department  of Oriental Studies at Stockholm University).

The CBE project was officially started in December 2012, when Vaartnou presented the idea of the CBE at the ECAI conference in University of California, Berkeley, USA.   We are looking for volunteer editors for the Chinese Buddhist Encyclopedia project. CBE needs a lot of data research and editing. Usually every editor has their own Buddhism-related topic(s) (English and Chinese speakers). Which he/she would gather as much material as possible.   Together we can make a difference and build up huge online Buddhist source. So we welcome everyone who could contribute their valuable time by editing and adding materials from different sources all over the internet.

Although we do not  exclude scholarship in digital culture and culture studies,   Asiascape: Digital Asia 's focus is on research  from the social sciences, arts, media and communication  studies, information and computer sciences, and area  studies.   Bringing together state-of-the-art research from these fields, 'Asiascape: Digital Asia' examines the role that information, communication, and other digital technologies play in Asian societies (Japan, the Koreas, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines), as well as in intra-regional dynamics and transnational links between the region and other parts of the world. The peer-reviewed journal addresses issues such as:     - media converge in the digital age   - transnational flows of digital culture,  - e-governance,  - the politics of network societies,  - online activism and digital challenges to state power,  - the workings of social and participatory media, and  - the dynamics of digital play.     The editors welcome contributions that analyse these issues through research that takes seriously the workings of ICT in different contexts, that critically theorizes such workings, and that is based on authoritative empirical analysis. We particularly encourage inter- and multi- disciplinary research that adopts digital methods, as well as theoretically-minded work that critically explores how ICTs can be understood through the lenses of different realities in Asia.   Asiascape: Digital Asia further welcomes reviews of book on the topics outlined above, with a specific focus on reviews that introduce non-Asian related works and scholars to the area-studies community, and research on Asia to the larger field of digital media and communication studies.

The series seeks to illuminate the  intersections between material culture studies, art history, and the  history of collecting. HMCC takes as its starting point the idea that  objects both contributed to the formation of knowledge in the past and  likewise contribute to our understanding of the past today. The human  relationship to objects has proven a rich field of scholarly inquiry,  with much recent scholarship either anthropological or sociological  rather than art historical in perspective. Underpinning this series is  the idea that the physical nature of objects contributes substantially  to their social meanings, and therefore that the visual, tactile, and  sensual dimensions of objects are critical to their interpretation.  HMCC therefore seeks to bridge anthropology and art history, sociology  and aesthetics. It encompasses the following areas of concern:     1. Material culture in its broadest dimension, including the high arts  of painting and sculpture, the decorative arts (furniture, ceramics,  metalwork, etc.), and everyday objects of all kinds.   2. Collecting practices, be they institutionalized activities  associated with museums, governmental authorities, and religious  entities, or collecting done by individuals and social groups.   3. The role of objects in defining self, community, and difference in  an increasingly international and globalized world, with cross-cultural  exchange and travel the central modes of object transfer.   4. Objects as constitutive of historical narratives, be they devised  by historical figures seeking to understand their past or in the form  of modern scholarly narratives.     The  series publishes interdisciplinary and comparative research  on objects that addresses one or more of these perspectives  and includes monographs, thematic studies, and edited  volumes of essays. A list of current and forthcoming  titles in the series can be viewed at http://www.ashgate.com/Default.aspx?page=4163 .   Proposals should take the form of either:  1. a preliminary letter of inquiry, briefly describing the project; or  2. a formal prospectus including: abstract, brief statement of your  critical methodology, table of contents, sample chapter, estimated word  count, estimate of the number and type of illustrations to be included, and a c.v.

In the last few decades there  has been a huge rise in the interest in East Asian popular  culture. The East Asian Journal of Popular Culture  will be engaging directly with that trend. From film  to music; art to translation and fashion to tourism,  this journal will offer a forum where multidisciplinary  work can come together in new and exciting ways.   The East Asian Journal of Popular Culture is the first academic peer-reviewed journal for scholars, teachers, and students from around the world who have an active and passionate interest in the popular culture of East Asia. The journal is devoted to all aspects of Popular Culture in East Asia. With the growth in popularity of Asian visual products in the Western world and the increasing strength of the Asian markets, this publication fulfils the need for an international journal that allows Western and Asian film, media, literary, music, fashion, digital media, television, art and cultural scholars alike to engage in discussion. The journal encourages articles that are both localised (towards a specific popular culture trend, figure or industry) as well as articles that are more global in their outlook (forging links between East Asian popular culture and wider global issues).   We welcome papers on any of these and related topics. If you would like to submit a paper or contact us about a proposed special edition please e-mail eajpopculture@gmail.com or one of the editors for further advice.

The  work to appear in e-JECAR is of three types: (i) extensive research  articles; (ii) essays from emerging scholars, to give (typically)  younger scholars the opportunity to present recently completed work  (e.g. a doctoral thesis) or to describe new work that they may be  embarking on (such as a post-doctoral project or a new database); and  (iii) review articles that engage with issues raised by recently  published research (please note that we do not publish short, mainly  descriptive book reviews).   e-JECAR is published in electronic form only and is offered to the  academic community and the general public in the spirit of open  scholarship and open-source technology. Authors are encouraged to  exploit the opportunities offered by new technology, e.g. in including  graphic materials and audio-visual sources that inform their work.   The journal will thus initially have three sections:     1.   Articles  We invite substantial studies of topics covered by the  journal's remit. Submissions which range across the  borders of the countries of East and Central Asia (both  historically and in the present) and those which avail  themselves of multi-media technology in an innovative  manner, are particularly welcome. The first volume will  include studies by Friederike Assandri, Stephan-Peter  Bumbacher, Carmen Meinert, Licia Di Giacinto, and Henrik  H. Srensen.   2.   Emerging Scholars  The purpose of this section is to provide a forum for  emerging scholars to present their work (typically but  not necessarily work from a recent doctoral thesis)  in a manner which is more formal and permanent than  short reviews or postings to e-mail distribution lists.  It is expected that contributors to this section will  have completed their PhD or be in the final stages of  completing their doctoral thesis or dissertation. Items  will normally be in the region of 3,000 to 5,000 words.     3.   Review Articles  Review articles are extended essays which address an  issue that features in more than one major study. Whilst  submissions may focus on one work, it is expected that  authors will write with reference to other relevant  studies in the field. We do not envisage publishing  brief synopses that address critical issues incidentally.  The normal length for items in this section is also  3,000 to 5,000 words.     We have elected to distribute the studies in this journal freely to  the scholarly community, under the terms of the Creative Commons  licence and in line with the policies of major funding bodies in the  UK. Thanks are due to the University of Edinburgh, which is providing  the hosting service and technical assistance for setting up and  maintaining the site.

The Chief   Editor welcomes queries about the suitability of   manuscripts to the JJA . Please read Notes   to Contributors and Style Sheet carefully when you   prepare your manuscript.   back to page index      Transnational Subjects: History, Society and Culture   [from H-ASIA, 9/26/13]   Transnational Subjects: History, Society and Culture is a journal for cultural and transnational history post-1500. The journal is print and online, and fully peer-reviewed. We invite essays on all aspects of transnational and cultural history   (4,000-7,000 words) and shorter report-type articles (less than 3,000   words) demonstrating transnational history work.

In September 2013, the academy had ten million unique visitors overall. For the art-history content alone, Khan anticipates more than two million visitors from around the globe for the fall 2013 semester. Let's make sure strong, global art-history content is well represented.   If you are interested in contributing your expertise in the form of short introductory essays to help make art history accessible to a global audience, Smarthistory could really use your help. The website's founders, Steven Zucker and Beth Harris, seek art historians, archaeologists, and conservators in many areas of study; they have a particular need for specialists in African, Asian, precolonial American, and Pacific art.   Smarthistory has created an interactive list of topics, a Trello Board , with an eye toward supporting introductory art-history courses. If something important is missing, please let Zucker and Harris know! Once you've decided on a topic, send an email to Zucker and Harris (along with your CV). If everything is in order, you will be added to the Trello Board, so you can claim that topic.   Here are the essay guidelines:  - Length: 8001,000 words  - Writing style: informal, experiential, contextual  - Content: for teaching (not original research)   As a general rule, Smarthistory looks for the narratives a great professor tells his or her class to make students fall in love with a particular subject or work of art.   All accepted contributed content is published on both khanacademy.org and smarthistory.khanacademy.org . All content is published with a Creative Commons attribution and noncommercial license.

New Studies of Modern Japan is a multidisciplinary series that   consists primarily of original studies on a broad spectrum of topics   dealing with Japan since the mid-nineteenth century. Additionally,   the series aims to bring back into print classic works that shed new   light on contemporary Japan. The series speaks to cultural studies   (literature, translations, film), history, and social sciences   audiences. We publish compelling works of scholarship, by both   established and rising scholars in the field, on a broad arena of   topics, in order to nuance our understandings of Japan and the   Japanese. Information on the series is available online at https://rowman.com/Page/LEXSeries .   Prospective authors are encouraged to contact Doug Slaymaker or Bill Tsutsui .   back to page index     \"Composite Realities: The Art of Photographic Manipulation in Asia\"   [from MCLC, 9/18/14]   Special issue of the TAP Review , guest edited by Claire Roberts (University of Adelaide, Australia) and Yi Gu (University of Toronto, Canada)   Manipulationof light, time and processis central to the production of photographs. It is because of this inherent flexibility, perhaps, that practitioners have long played with the apparent objectivity of the medium. In the pre-digital era, techniques that have been used to improve upon or challenge the rhetoric of truth associated with photography include the use of painted studio backdrops, and techniques such as masking, vignetting, multiple exposures, composite photography, photo montage, photo collage, as well as retouching, inscribing and hand colouring.   How have photographers working across Asia engaged in practices that might be regarded as thinking beyond the camera to create images that combine document and artifice? The art of photographic manipulation in Asia will be the topic of the fall issue (2015) of the Trans Asia Photography Review . Photographs under discussion can be historic or contemporary (including digitally manipulated images), artistic, promotional, conceptual or personal. Photographs can come from any location within Asia or Asian diaspora communities. We welcome articles (length open), interviews and curatorial projects (12-20 images with introductory text).   Please circulate this call for papers to all you know who may be interested. Send proposals to Claire Roberts .   back to page index             Last     modified 11 Nov 2014.
