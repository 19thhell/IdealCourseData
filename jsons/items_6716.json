Students in the MA General program may choose to specialize in a particular area of psychology, though this is not required. Our wide range of courses, coupled with the research opportunities available through our\u00a0 doctoral programs , provides many possibilities for specialization. Note that the specializations listed below are just suggestions, and are not meant to be exhaustive. Students, in collaboration with an advisor, may devise their own specialization.

If you are a prospective applicant interested in the SCP specialization, you should apply directly to the General MA Psychology Program and note in your application essay that your interest is in the SCP track. Instructions for application procedures can be found here: http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication           SCP Description      SCP Course Requirements      SCP Graduation requirements      SCP Faculty      SCP Description      The NYU General Masters Degree specialization in Social and Consumer Psychology focuses on the psychological factors influencing consumer behavior, including purchase behavior, effect of social influence, information processing of product/marketing messages, motivated goal and decision making, and assessment of marketing and advertising communication effectiveness. How organizations manage brands and situational change through leadership, structure and processes is also addressed.      Click here for the NYU Social &amp; Consumer Psychology Association website      Core concepts in perception, memory, social psychology/cognition, motivation, self-regulation, industrial/organizational and personality psychology are applied to consumer behavior. Statistical and research methodology training is intrinsic to the field of social and consumer behavior. The unique combination of NYU&rsquo;s resources to study social psychology and consumer behavior from a research perspective and to have access to courses and faculty in other departments and schools within NYU allows a student to select and prepare for multiple career directions while fulfilling the following learning objectives:           Understand the major influences on consumer behavior mediated by internal perceptual, cognitive, and social psychological processes. This includes self-concept goal motivations and congruence with brand characteristics that drive decision-making.      Learn statistical, research, and computer tools necessary for academic research, consumer market research, product development and consumer satisfaction assessments.      Understand sources of external influence such as culture on globalization/localization of purchase and consumer decision-making.      Learn the industrial/organizational factors that impact the consumer including corporate leadership and strategic organizational change management.      Gain a basic understanding of social media as a form of social influence on consumer behavior and market research.           Career pathways with the Social and Consumer Psychology specialization include: marketing, market research, corporate communications, focus group facilitation and analysis, consumer awareness education, advocacy and public policy consulting, and general HR roles within product development and manufacturing companies. Students also prepare for academic research careers and doctoral studies in Social Psychology, Consumer Psychology or Business with this specialization. Note: The specialization in Social and Consumer Psychology is available as an informal track that does not appear on students' transcripts. The Department may develop a concentration that designates a formal course of study designed to meet standards set by the NYS Board of Regents. For more information on the field of consumer psychology, including career opportunities, we recommend looking into APA's Division 23, the Society for Consumer Psychology: http://www.apa.org/about/division/div23.aspx      SCP Course Requirements      In the context of the broader requirements of the MA program, the suggested options for a 36-credit curriculum with a social and consumer psychology specialization are listed below.

Because schools continuously update their   offerings, please check their catalog or website. The classes below   are ones that our students have been interested in, however you may   find other relevant courses in Economics, NYU Polytechnic School of   Engineering, or Computer Science depending on whether you have the pre-requisite courses or skill. A sample is included below:      Stern School of Business           Marketing (a course for non-Stern students is offered each Fall semester)      Market Research      Business Strategy      Organizational behavior courses (change management, leadership, etc.)           Steinhardt School of Education           History of Consumer Culture      Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture      Issues in Organizational Communication           NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies \u2013 Courses MUST be within their Masters Program (not Certificate Program)           Marketing      Market Research      Database Management (SAS)      Foundations of Human Resource Management      Business Strategy and Ethics           SCP Graduation Requirements          In addition to completing the course requirements described above, students will take the Comprehensive Examination or complete a MA thesis.                Comprehensive Examination : A separate written comprehensive examination, similar to the  one that is given to General MA students, is offered three times a year,  on the first Fridays of the following months: October, February, and  June. The &quot;comps&quot; exam for the Social and Consumer  Psychology specialization requires studying from, and taking, the  following 3 question sets:      1) The Psychology of Social Behavior Question Set (Core B); 2) The  Consumer Psychology Question Set; and, 3) Choice of one Core A Question  Set.           OR                MA Thesis: Instead of  the Comprehensive Examination, the student may seek permission to write an  MA thesis. For such permission to be granted, the student must demonstrate  an outstanding record of performance in his or her studies and, as a  minimum, must have completed all of the core requirements with at least a  B+ average in all core courses. The student must also secure the  sponsorship of a full-time faculty member in consultation with the MA  director.
