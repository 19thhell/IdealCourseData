Mechanical engineering offers almost limitless opportunity for the inventions and innovations that lead to entrepreneurial ventures.   Through hands-on computer and laboratory work in our state-of-the-art facilities, the School of Engineering&#39;s Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BMSE) program teaches the principles underpinning the discipline and how to apply them in the field. We also develop your talents in such specialized areas as solid and fluid mechanics, machine control systems, and robotic devices.Our BSME degree program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET ( www.abet.org ).   Mechanical engineers find careers in industries including national defense, aerospace, automotive, and telecommunications. Mechanical engineering also has a long tradition of breaking new ground in such areas as resource conservation, improved efficiency of energy-consuming devices, and renewable energy sources. There are emerging opportunities in biomedical systems and devices, as well as nanotechnology and mechatronics. Alternatively, our students can use their education as a springboard to law, medicine, corporate management, or further graduate studies.   Program Educational Objectives   The objectives of the undergraduate BSME program at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering are for its graduates to:   1. Be engaged and advance in careers in mechanical or related engineering, or other professional career paths, that include industry, academia, and governmental or non-governmental organizations.      2. Seek continuous professional development and life-long learning through graduate school studies, continuing education credits and/or professional registration.   Student Outcomes   The student outcomes are as follows:   (a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering   (b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data   (c) an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs   (d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams   (e) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems   (f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility   (g) an ability to communicate effectively   (h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context   (i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning   (j) a knowledge of contemporary issues   (k) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice   (P1) apply principles of engineering, basic science, and mathematics (including multivariate calculus and differential equations) to model, analyze, design, and realize physical systems, components or processes   (P2) work professionally in both thermal or mechanical systems areas.   Minors   You can choose to enhance your undergraduate degree with a minor that can be seamlessly integrated into your BS in Mechanical Engineering program:   Minor in Aerospace Engineering   Moon and planetary vehicles, deep-space probes and space habitats, once confined to the realm of science fiction, are now realities. Vehicles under design or projected for the future in aircraft, spacecraft, and other airborne and space-related devices and systems challenge the imagination. They also challenge the current knowledge base and state of the art of the technologies involved. The scientific aspects of aircraft and spacecraft design are rooted in mechanical engineering. The Minor in Aerospace Engineering prepares students to push the boundaries of knowledge, lead teams of specialists to achieve mission-specific goals, and follow successful careers in aerospace related industries.   Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear Science and Engineering   The Nuclear Engineering field is experiencing a major resurgence from the skeptical public attitude of the 1970s and 1980s that resulted in a stagnated nuclear power industry for more than 2 decades. At the same time nuclear technologies have emerged in many fields to provide advanced solutions to challenging problems, such as food processing, instrumentation, diagnostics, and perhaps most importantly in the medical industry where many nuclear-based diagnostic and therapeutic procedures have saved and improved the lives of millions. In addition, growing concerns regarding global warming have again shifted the attitude of the public to a more favorable view of the potential benefits of carbon-free nuclear power.   To meet the demands of this resurgent industry, engineers proficient in the fundamentals of the nuclear sciences and engineering are needed. The Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear Sciences and Engineering, which is offered in collaboration with the Department of Applied Physics, prepares graduates for rewarding and successful careers in nuclear sciences and engineering related fields.

At the School of Engineering, we groom our students to become the inventors and innovators of tomorrow. Our PhD in Mechanical Engineering program offers a balanced curriculum that emphasizes the principles behind these designs and approaches. To apply these principles in the field, we make computational and research experience an integral component of your studies.   We also offer you the freedom to choose from 5 distinct areas of specialization:      aerospace engineering    controls and dynamic systems    fluid dynamics and thermal systems    materials engineering    mechanics and structural systems     The high faculty-to-student ratio of our program ensures you develop close ties to your instructors and fellow students. This fosters lifelong relationships and a rigorous intellectual community of scholars.   Many of our graduates enter such fields as computer engineering, nanotechnology, software development, and financial engineering. They also occupy positions in bioengineering, manufacturing, astronautics, systems engineering, and corporate management and law.   Admission Requirements   Admission to this program requires an MS in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering or other closely related engineering field or applied sciences. Generally, you must also be able to present a GPA of 3.5 or better in your MS work. In cases where it is unclear that the required MS specialization has been satisfied, the degree requirements for the Mechanical Engineering, MS at the School of Engineering will define the necessary reparation. This same criterion applies for degrees received in other engineering disciplines.   Those with a BS in Mechanical or Aerospace Engineering and a GPA of 3.5 or better may apply directly to the program.      Applicants to this degree program may be eligible to participate in    the Abu Dhabi Global Fellow Program .
