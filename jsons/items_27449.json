Home Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has held a central position in American music scholarship and creativity. NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992. It has since grown into one of the country\u2019s most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences. Our facilities include early and world music instrument collections, the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media , and the Waverly Labs for Music and Computing , which provide faculty and students with equipment, lab and workshops spaces for research and creation in music and sound art.

Students have the option to receive introductory music business training or learn about the history and culture of creative entrepreneurs in recorded music. Students are also introduced to the tools and techniques of recording and begin to use the recording studio as their creative laboratory. In the second year, students deepen their understanding of the art and business of creating and selling recorded music. Students have the opportunity to study the \u201cartist,\u201d how musical talent is identified and cultivated, how material is selected and arranged, how a complete album is constructed in the studio and how the audience and artist have historically influenced each other. Upon completion of a second year review, students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop a personalized course of study focusing on their area of interest. During the third and fourth years, students may pursue advanced level study in business, production, history &amp; criticism, or musicianship via courses offered through the department, as well as through the Stern School of Business, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, during their third year, students have the opportunity to study abroad in one of Tisch's study abroad programs, or participate in the department\u2019s required internship program. The \ufb01nal year culminates with the Capstone Project in which students develop a full creative plan to launch themselves as entrepreneurs. Projects have included launching a record label, creating a production company, developing a new media company, and starting an innovative music venue. As is the case with all Tisch programs, professional training is combined with a solid liberal arts education. In addition to the 58 points taken within the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, students are expected to earn a total of 44 general education points in courses offered by Tisch and the College of Arts and Science. Students also complement their study with 26 points in elective courses taken in the areas of their interest.    Internship Opportunites    Students have the opportunity to complete an industry internship at an established, institutional record company such as Universal or Mercury Records; an independent production company such as Epitaph Records; a trade publication such as Billboard or Impact ; a trade broadcast company such as VH1 or MTV; or a music recording association such as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), or the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
