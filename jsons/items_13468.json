Containing nearly one-third of Argentina's population, the city has had an inordinate impact not only on Argentina, but on Latin American consciousness and identity. This three-week course traces the evolution of the political theorists, educational reformers, and creative artists whose works have shaped the culture, art, and politics of Buenos Aires and Argentina.   For immigrants arriving in Argentina in the 19th century, the search for opportunity required a narrative that would justify identification with the nation state. A mythology that celebrated the independent\u2014and mestizo\u2014&quot;gauchos&quot; of the pampas was slowly replaced by a philosophy that excluded peoples of color and redefined &quot;whiteness\u201d as a desired objective in repopulating the entire nation. The &quot;Generation of 1880\u201d played an important role in shaping this new identity, and its impact is still felt in Buenos Aires, where the African population has been subsumed by other ethnic groups. Yet the Africanist heritage is apparent in such cultural artifacts as the tango, a dance of African derivation but whose origins are sometimes contested in Argentine discourse.   In the 21st century, the upheavals of the &quot;dirty war,&quot; the trauma of the desaparecidos (the disappeared), the Malvinas War, and the economic crisis of 2001 all occasioned not only political but artistic responses. Argentina\u2019s political and economic fortunes have created a unique dialogue between the arts and politics. In Buenos Aires, the national capital, arts inform and influence the national debate to a great extent. We examine this phenomenon and its effect on Argentine society.   Readings may include excerpts from the works of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Robert Ferris Thompson, and George Reid Andrews; fiction by Jorge Lu\u00eds Borges, Silvina Ocampo, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Roberto Arlt, and Adolfo Bioy Casares; such documents as &quot;Nunca M\u00e1s\u201d and the film The Afro-Argentines.   Field trips encompass the rich resources of the city's museums, historical sites, f\u00fatbol games, and ethnic neighborhoods. Sessions with leading Argentine jurists, educators, and artists are an important component of this course. In addition, students will take a short trip to Montevideo, Uruguay.

The Last Hour of Summer: The Lost Photographs of Ipanema , forthcoming on Casa da Palavra Press. Bio Peter Lucas teaches at New York University and The New School. He received his Ph.D. from NYU in 1996. His teaching and scholarly writing focuses on human rights with an emphasis on participatory media, documentary practice, photography, the poetics of witnessing, human rights education, and youth media. He also directs the International Field Program for Brazil in the Graduate Program of International Affairs at the New School, an annual two-month study abroad program in human rights and media in Rio de Janiero.    As a photographer, Peter Lucas focuses on personal photography, found images, and documentary aesthetics. He exhibits regularly in New York and Rio de Janeiro. His current projects include Arpoador: Sunday Evenings In Rio de Janeiro , an ongoing project of original photos documenting the outcropping of rocks between the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema.    As a filmmaker, he has made two films. His film Passing, is a poetical short film about the last caf\u00e9 photographer in Rio de Janeiro. For over 40 years, the late Sergio Silvira, otherwise known as Gaucho, photographed the patrons of the samba bars in Rio. The film caught Gaucho in the twilight of his career when the long tradition of caf\u00e9 photography in Rio was coming to an end. Using a classical observational mode of filming, the film shadows Gaucho to capture the visual poetry of his nightly walks and picture taking.    His second film, The Mural of Pain , is a poetic study on the right to memory in Brazil and the collective trauma of armed violence in Rio. Working with a visual memorial of personal photographs of victims of lethal violence created on 2000, the film traces what happened with these photos over ten years. His new film project, The Last Hour of Summer , uses a cache of found photographs to evoke the early 1960s in Ipanema, just before the military coup in Brazil. This project is currently in the pre-production stage while production funds are being raised. In the spring of 2011, Peter Lucas was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for The Last Hour of Summer film proposal.

Containing nearly one-third of Argentina's population, the city has had an inordinate impact not only on Argentina, but on Latin American consciousness and identity. This three-week course traces the evolution of the political theorists, educational reformers, and creative artists whose works have shaped the culture, art, and politics of Buenos Aires and Argentina.   For immigrants arriving in Argentina in the 19th century, the search for opportunity required a narrative that would justify identification with the nation state. A mythology that celebrated the independent\u2014and mestizo\u2014&quot;gauchos&quot; of the pampas was slowly replaced by a philosophy that excluded peoples of color and redefined &quot;whiteness\u201d as a desired objective in repopulating the entire nation. The &quot;Generation of 1880\u201d played an important role in shaping this new identity, and its impact is still felt in Buenos Aires, where the African population has been subsumed by other ethnic groups. Yet the Africanist heritage is apparent in such cultural artifacts as the tango, a dance of African derivation but whose origins are sometimes contested in Argentine discourse.   In the 21st century, the upheavals of the &quot;dirty war,&quot; the trauma of the desaparecidos (the disappeared), the Malvinas War, and the economic crisis of 2001 all occasioned not only political but artistic responses. Argentina\u2019s political and economic fortunes have created a unique dialogue between the arts and politics. In Buenos Aires, the national capital, arts inform and influence the national debate to a great extent. We examine this phenomenon and its effect on Argentine society.   Readings may include excerpts from the works of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3, Robert Ferris Thompson, and George Reid Andrews; fiction by Jorge Lu\u00eds Borges, Silvina Ocampo, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Roberto Arlt, and Adolfo Bioy Casares; such documents as &quot;Nunca M\u00e1s\u201d and the film The Afro-Argentines.   Field trips encompass the rich resources of the city's museums, historical sites, f\u00fatbol games, and ethnic neighborhoods. Sessions with leading Argentine jurists, educators, and artists are an important component of this course. In addition, students will take a short trip to Montevideo, Uruguay.

He received his Ph.D. from NYU in 1996. His teaching and scholarly writing focuses on human rights with an emphasis on participatory media, documentary practice, photography, the poetics of witnessing, human rights education, and youth media. He also directs the International Field Program for Brazil in the Graduate Program of International Affairs at the New School, an annual two-month study abroad program in human rights and media in Rio de Janiero.    As a photographer, Peter Lucas focuses on personal photography, found images, and documentary aesthetics. He exhibits regularly in New York and Rio de Janeiro. His current projects include Arpoador: Sunday Evenings In Rio de Janeiro , an ongoing project of original photos documenting the outcropping of rocks between the beaches of Copacabana and Ipanema.    As a filmmaker, he has made two films. His film Passing, is a poetical short film about the last caf\u00e9 photographer in Rio de Janeiro. For over 40 years, the late Sergio Silvira, otherwise known as Gaucho, photographed the patrons of the samba bars in Rio. The film caught Gaucho in the twilight of his career when the long tradition of caf\u00e9 photography in Rio was coming to an end. Using a classical observational mode of filming, the film shadows Gaucho to capture the visual poetry of his nightly walks and picture taking.    His second film, The Mural of Pain , is a poetic study on the right to memory in Brazil and the collective trauma of armed violence in Rio. Working with a visual memorial of personal photographs of victims of lethal violence created on 2000, the film traces what happened with these photos over ten years. His new film project, The Last Hour of Summer , uses a cache of found photographs to evoke the early 1960s in Ipanema, just before the military coup in Brazil. This project is currently in the pre-production stage while production funds are being raised. In the spring of 2011, Peter Lucas was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for The Last Hour of Summer film proposal.
