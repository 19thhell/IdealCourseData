Course may be repeated.    Intermediate Edit Workshop is designed to be taken the semester immediately after an intermediate film production workshop (color sync, documentary workshop, experimental workshop). Together, both courses serve to give the student a comprehensive Sync Sound Experience, from script to locked picture. In the Editing Workshop, students are expected to finish with a fine cut of their workshop exercise by the end of the semester. In addition, the class will explore the entire post-production experience; basic visual cutting of sync and non-sync material, the assembly, the rough cut, the fine cut, sound and music cutting, preparing for the mix, answer print or final print. We will also explore what an editor must know in dealing with the labs, basic organization of the editing room and the use and care of editing room tools. All stages of work are treated from the viewpoint of a professional editor.

It is strongly recommended that you enroll in Post-Production Colloquium, H56.0060, 1 credit, in the same semester that you enroll in any intermediate-level core production course.    Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop is a practical course in which students (collaborating in crews of four) are exposed to a broad range of production techniques through production experience and class discussion. Each group produces four color sync-sound exercises during the semester that explore craft, aesthetic, production and storytelling issues. As a group member, each student will serve in rotation as director, producer, camera, sound, and AC/gaffer. Students are encouraged to edit their work in the Intermediate Edit Workshop (H56.1018) the following semester.    Important note: students should enter Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop with a short (i.e., 3-5 pages, but no more than 8) script. The production work in this course is strenuous. Students should be conscious of this when designing their semester schedules.
