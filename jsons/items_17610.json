In fact, all electronics devices receive the attention, the design, and the creative input of electrical engineers.   As a student in the MS in Electrical Engineering program, you&rsquo;ll use what you&rsquo;ve already learned about physics, chemistry, and mathematics create the products of tomorrow. We support this kind of initiative by providing top-flight laboratories &mdash; home to developments in microwaves, VLSI design, and robotics &mdash; as well as a faculty dedicated to advanced research.   The program will prepare you for a professional career as an entrepreneur, a practicing engineer in industry, business or government at an advanced level, or to pursue a PhD degree in electrical engineering. You can choose a concentration from a number of stimulating fields, including the following:      Communications, Networking and Signal Processing    Computer Engineering and VLSI    Energy systems and power electronics    Electromagnetics and analog/RF/Biomedical circuits    Systems, control, and robotics        This program is also offered online .

The department rose to prominence in the mid-twentieth century for work in microwaves, communications, electrical machinery, and automatic control. Current research activities are organized into five major areas:     Communications, Networking, and Signal Processing   Systems, Control and Robotics   Energy Systems and Power Electronics   Electromagnetics and Analog/RF/Biomedical Circuits   Computer Engineering and VLSI     Faculty and students are engaged in research sponsored at an annual rate of about $7 million by government agencies and industrial organizations. Many of the projects are coordinated in two research centers: the Center for Advanced Technologies in Telecommunications (CATT) , which is sponsored by New York State, and the NYU WIRELESS center .   While the eminence of our department is partly due to the research and textbooks produced by our faculty, our strong reputation is largely a result of the success of our graduates in their careers after college.

In fact, all electronics devices receive the attention, the design, and the creative input of electrical engineers.   As a student in the MS in Electrical Engineering program, you&rsquo;ll use what you&rsquo;ve already learned about physics, chemistry, and mathematics create the products of tomorrow. We support this kind of initiative by providing top-flight laboratories &mdash; home to developments in microwaves, VLSI design, and robotics &mdash; as well as a faculty dedicated to advanced research.   The program will prepare you for a professional career as an entrepreneur, a practicing engineer in industry, business or government at an advanced level, or to pursue a PhD degree in electrical engineering. You can choose a concentration from a number of stimulating fields, including the following:      Communications, Networking and Signal Processing    Computer Engineering and VLSI    Energy systems and power electronics    Electromagnetics and analog/RF/Biomedical circuits    Systems, control, and robotics        This program is also offered online .

The department rose to prominence in the mid-twentieth century for work in microwaves, communications, electrical machinery, and automatic control. Current research activities are organized into five major areas:     Communications, Networking, and Signal Processing   Systems, Control and Robotics   Energy Systems and Power Electronics   Electromagnetics and Analog/RF/Biomedical Circuits   Computer Engineering and VLSI     Faculty and students are engaged in research sponsored at an annual rate of about $7 million by government agencies and industrial organizations. Many of the projects are coordinated in two research centers: the Center for Advanced Technologies in Telecommunications (CATT) , which is sponsored by New York State, and the NYU WIRELESS center .   While the eminence of our department is partly due to the research and textbooks produced by our faculty, our strong reputation is largely a result of the success of our graduates in their careers after college. Therefore, the department is dedicated to serving the needs of its students, and preparing them for the evolving trends in their future fields of employment.
