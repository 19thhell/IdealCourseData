In their junior and senior years, students typically focus on developing their research skills and exploring fieldwork opportunities. In conjunction with their advisor, students select a sequence of courses that satisfy program and degree requirements while simultaneously exploring their own intellectual and professional objectives. A total of 128 course credits are required to graduate.    Programs of Study    Students are held to the degree requirements that were in place the year they were accepted. These required courses are outlined in the Program of Study. Applied Psychology      Global Public Health/Applied Psychology    2014-2015                2014-2015    2013-2014                2013-2014    2012-2013                2012-2013    2011-2012    2010-2011    2009-2010    2008-2009     Academic Standards    All students majoring in Applied Psychology must earn a C- or better in all courses taken to meet the requirements for the psychology core, restricted psychology electives, research skills, fieldwork experiences, and specialization electives. If a student receives a grade lower than a C-, that student must retake the course to improve the grade. Students may only retake a course once. Students may retake a maximum of 4 courses to improve their grades. Students unable to meet these academic standards will be referred to the department&rsquo;s committee on student progress and may be advised into an alternative major at NYU.  Majors in Applied Psychology are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.7 and a minimum GPA of 2.7 in the major in order to make satisfactory academic progress .     Liberal Arts Core    Steinhardt Liberal Arts Core courses expand the options available to Steinhardt students through NYU's Morse Academic Plan (MAP). MAP is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Applied Psychology students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing WRI-UF 1001 and WRII-UF 2002 (Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering NYU Steinhardt who are attempting to transfer credit for their writing requirement must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation.    Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing. If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students taken in two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    Foreign Language    Applied Psychology students must complete one semester of foreign language. APUG students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores.    Coursework is available in the following language. Asterisks indicate that an intensive sequence is available:    American Sign Language Arabic Cantonese Chinese Czech French* German* Ancient Greek Modern Greek Hebrew Hindi/Urdu Modern Irish Italian* Japanese Korean Latin Persian Portuguese* Russian Spanish* Swahili    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available here: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .     Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Liberal Arts Core is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the MAP plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The three course headings are: Conversations of the West, World Cultures, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas (formerly Conversations of the West)    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores: AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Cultures and Contexts (formerly World Cultures)    All options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Expressive Cultures    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores: AP English Literature with a score of 4 or 5    NYU Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Expressive Cultures requirement: LIBAR-UE 0941 Art: Practice and Ideas LIBAR-UE 0171 Introduction to Theatre as Art Form for Non-Majors    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) couples coordinated courses in Quantitative Reasoning and the Natural Sciences. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of these offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.    Quantitative Reasoning/Mathematics Requirement    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:    AP Calculus (Mathematics AB or BC) AP Statistics    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Natural Science    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:    AP Biology (8 points) AP Chemistry (8 points) AP Physics B (10 points) AP Physics C-Mech (3 points) and Physics C-E&amp;M (3 points)    NYU Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Natural Science requirement: LIBAR-UE 0141 Science in the Community LIBAR-UE 0331 Introduction To Human Physiology    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Elective Sequence    Because the field of psychology is becoming more and more interdisciplinary, it is important for students to gain a foundation of knowledge in another area of the social sciences or humanities outside the field of psychology. Students are required to complete a 3-course sequence in one discipline of the social sciences or humanities. This includes one introductory course and two higher-level courses in one of the following departments:    American Sign Language Anthropology Art History Classics Comparative Literature East Asian Studies Economics English French German Hebrew and Judaic Studies History Italian Linguistics Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Philosophy Politics Russian and Slavic Studies Social and Cultural Analysis Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literature    Liberal Arts Electives    Students who are accepted into the Applied Psychology or Global Public Health/Applied Psychology program as first-year students have the freedom to select 16 credits (4 courses) from any liberal arts discipline to complete as liberal arts electives. Transfer students have 24 credits (6 courses) to complete. Often, students will continue taking courses in the area of the social sciences or humanities that they completed for their required sequence in order to pursue a minor or double major in that discipline.    Other departments to consider when signing up for liberal arts electives include:    Biology Chemistry Child and Adolescent Mental Development Computer Science Dramatic Literature Mathematics Music Neural Science Physics Psychology    In addition to the departments listed above, students can select liberal arts electives from NYU Steinhardt through the Liberal Arts Core (LIBAR-UE xxxx). Only non-Applied Psychology courses through the Liberal Arts Core will be considered. Click here to view NYU Steinhardt's current Liberal Arts Core listings    Transfer Students    Transfer students have slightly different Liberal Arts requirements from those who were admitted to the program as first-year students. In addition to the transfer requirements for Expository Writing listed above, transfer students are required to complete or transfer in one course from Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC), one course from Scientific Inquiry (FSI), and one ADDITIONAL course from FCC or FSI. This adjustment allows for more flexibility in allocating transfer credit, and increases the Liberal Art Elective requirement by 8 credits (total 24 credits). Effective Fall 2014, NYU students interested in changing majors, transferring internally, or transitioning into Applied Psychology must have completed at least one course in psychology with a grade of B or better. We recommend that students have a 2.7 GPA or better prior to declaring a major in Applied Psychology in order to make satisfactory academic progress within the major.

In their junior and senior years, students typically focus on developing their research skills and exploring fieldwork opportunities. In conjunction with their advisor, students select a sequence of courses that satisfy program and degree requirements while simultaneously exploring their own intellectual and professional objectives. A total of 128 course credits are required to graduate.    Programs of Study    Students are held to the degree requirements that were in place the year they were accepted. These required courses are outlined in the Program of Study. Applied Psychology      Global Public Health/Applied Psychology    2014-2015                2014-2015    2013-2014                2013-2014    2012-2013                2012-2013    2011-2012    2010-2011    2009-2010    2008-2009     Academic Standards    All students majoring in Applied Psychology must earn a C- or better in all courses taken to meet the requirements for the psychology core, restricted psychology electives, research skills, fieldwork experiences, and specialization electives. If a student receives a grade lower than a C-, that student must retake the course to improve the grade. Students may only retake a course once. Students may retake a maximum of 4 courses to improve their grades. Students unable to meet these academic standards will be referred to the department&rsquo;s committee on student progress and may be advised into an alternative major at NYU.  Majors in Applied Psychology are expected to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.7 and a minimum GPA of 2.7 in the major in order to make satisfactory academic progress .     Liberal Arts Core    Steinhardt Liberal Arts Core courses expand the options available to Steinhardt students through NYU's Morse Academic Plan (MAP). MAP is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Applied Psychology students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing WRI-UF 1001 and WRII-UF 2002 (Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering NYU Steinhardt who are attempting to transfer credit for their writing requirement must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation.    Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing. If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students taken in two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    Foreign Language    Applied Psychology students must complete one semester of foreign language. APUG students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores.    Coursework is available in the following language. Asterisks indicate that an intensive sequence is available:    American Sign Language Arabic Cantonese Chinese Czech French* German* Ancient Greek Modern Greek Hebrew Hindi/Urdu Modern Irish Italian* Japanese Korean Latin Persian Portuguese* Russian Spanish* Swahili    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available here: http://www.nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .     Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the Liberal Arts Core is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the MAP plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The three course headings are: Conversations of the West, World Cultures, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas (formerly Conversations of the West)    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores: AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Cultures and Contexts (formerly World Cultures)    All options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Expressive Cultures    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores: AP English Literature with a score of 4 or 5    NYU Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Expressive Cultures requirement: LIBAR-UE 0941 Art: Practice and Ideas LIBAR-UE 0171 Introduction to Theatre as Art Form for Non-Majors    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) couples coordinated courses in Quantitative Reasoning and the Natural Sciences. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students. Within each of these offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes.    Quantitative Reasoning/Mathematics Requirement    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:    AP Calculus (Mathematics AB or BC) AP Statistics    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Natural Science    This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:    AP Biology (8 points) AP Chemistry (8 points) AP Physics B (10 points) AP Physics C-Mech (3 points) and Physics C-E&amp;M (3 points)    NYU Steinhardt courses that will satisfy the Natural Science requirement: LIBAR-UE 0141 Science in the Community LIBAR-UE 0331 Introduction To Human Physiology    All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's Morse Academic Plan. Listings and descriptions can be found here: http://map.cas.nyu.edu/page/1112courses    Social Sciences &amp; Humanities Elective Sequence    Because the field of psychology is becoming more and more interdisciplinary, it is important for students to gain a foundation of knowledge in another area of the social sciences or humanities outside the field of psychology. Students are required to complete a 3-course sequence in one discipline of the social sciences or humanities. This includes one introductory course and two higher-level courses in one of the following departments:    American Sign Language Anthropology Art History Classics Comparative Literature East Asian Studies Economics English French German Hebrew and Judaic Studies History Italian Linguistics Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Philosophy Politics Russian and Slavic Studies Social and Cultural Analysis Sociology Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literature    Liberal Arts Electives    Students who are accepted into the Applied Psychology or Global Public Health/Applied Psychology program as first-year students have the freedom to select 16 credits (4 courses) from any liberal arts discipline to complete as liberal arts electives. Transfer students have 24 credits (6 courses) to complete. Often, students will continue taking courses in the area of the social sciences or humanities that they completed for their required sequence in order to pursue a minor or double major in that discipline.    Other departments to consider when signing up for liberal arts electives include:    Biology Chemistry Child and Adolescent Mental Development Computer Science Dramatic Literature Mathematics Music Neural Science Physics Psychology    In addition to the departments listed above, students can select liberal arts electives from NYU Steinhardt through the Liberal Arts Core (LIBAR-UE xxxx). Only non-Applied Psychology courses through the Liberal Arts Core will be considered. Click here to view NYU Steinhardt's current Liberal Arts Core listings    Transfer Students    Transfer students have slightly different Liberal Arts requirements from those who were admitted to the program as first-year students. In addition to the transfer requirements for Expository Writing listed above, transfer students are required to complete or transfer in one course from Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC), one course from Scientific Inquiry (FSI), and one ADDITIONAL course from FCC or FSI. This adjustment allows for more flexibility in allocating transfer credit, and increases the Liberal Art Elective requirement by 8 credits (total 24 credits). Effective Fall 2014, NYU students interested in changing majors, transferring internally, or transitioning into Applied Psychology must have completed at least one course in psychology with a grade of B or better. We recommend that students have a 2.7 GPA or better prior to declaring a major in Applied Psychology in order to make satisfactory academic progress within the major.
