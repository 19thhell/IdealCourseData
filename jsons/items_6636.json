Description       From postcards to portraits, visual images inform how we see and understand the world around us. In the European-American framework, these ways of seeing have been influenced by global exchanges, colonial encounters, and cultural differences with &quot;the Orient.&quot; In this class, we begin by reading\u00a0 Orientalism \u00a0, Edward Said's foundational text that critically assesses the ways that representations of Asia and the Middle East have been constructed. We will also draw on the anthropologist Deborah Poole's concept of a &quot;visual economy,&quot; which she uses to think about the system and organization of visual images and their social relationships as they flow between cultures. Building on the questions posed by these thinkers, we will investigate visual images in relation to the imperial and post-colonial projects in Asian contexts, such as India, China, and Viet Nam. Through a series of short essays, culminating in a research paper on a cultural context and set of images of their own choosing, students will develop their thinking about the issues raised by class material and discussion, while building their research skills, such as locating legitimate sources and integrating authoritative voices into their own work. In addition to works by Said and Poole, readings may include texts by Igor Kopytoff, John Berger, Timothy Mitchell, Rey Chow, Michael Taussig, Hue Tam Ho Tai, Michel Foucault, Christopher Pinney, W. J. T. Mitchell and Linda Nochlin.
