Industrial Designer professionals give shape to new technology, creating mass-produced things like trains, cars, appliances, furniture, medical equipment, toys, packaging, corporate identity -- any user interface. The methodology based on scientific problem analysis with a user-centered perspective applies to any media. This integration of problem solving and creative inspiration in the hands of talented people is a very powerful tool, so powerful that Victor Papanek, author of Design for the Real World, says Industrial Design is \u201cthe most dangerous profession.\u201d By building a set of projects that explore materials, processes and aesthetics, you will apply a three phases of design process: 1. explore, 2. sketch, and 3.make. Class critiques focus on improving the product communication and looks, so we can be as good as we can! Note: This two-point class meets every other week throughout the semester.
