His work is crucial to the current state of play of the Israeli government\u2019s actions, both internally and abroad. In recent months, this has included providing advice in heightened security situations, such as confrontations between Israel and Hamas in Gaza this summer.   Sch\u00f6ndorf, 40, is relatively young to hold such a high position in the Israeli government; however, he already has an impressive record of working in the field of international law, with a particular focus on the negotiation of peace.   After receiving two LLBs and an MA in law and economics from Tel Aviv University, Sch\u00f6ndorf served as a senior legal adviser in the international law department of the Israeli Defense Forces Military Advocate General Unit. When Israelis and Syrians came together in 2000 in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, to negotiate the terms of a possible peace treaty, Sch\u00f6ndorf was part of the Israeli delegation.   It was a particularly significant experience for him on a personal level, he says, as someone who was born into the last war with Syria \u201cto be able to be there and meet people that there was previously no way for an Israeli to meet, then&#8230;to meet them in person and be able to exchange views about the future of our region, of our children, of our countries.\u201d   Later, while serving in the Israeli delegation to the assembly of states working on the formation of the International Criminal Court, Sch\u00f6ndorf became interested in writing a dissertation in the field of international criminal law. He came to NYU Law as a Fulbright and then Hauser Scholar, and wrote his dissertation under the direction of Professor Theodor Meron, who is now president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.   Sch\u00f6ndorf returned to Israel in 2010, when he was asked to establish the Department of Special International Affairs, a new department in Israel\u2019s Ministry of Justice.
