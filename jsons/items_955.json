The Postcolonial Studies Project at New York University The Postcolonial Studies Project at New York University  is based in the Department of English with strong links to the Departments of Anthropology, Cinema Studies, Comparative  Literature, History, Media, Culture and Communications, Social and Cultural Analysis. The project aims to foster vital  investigation into areas that include the legacies of imperialism; anti-colonial and postcolonial thought; literature,  film and cultural production emerging from the postcolonial condition; problematics surrounding issues of gender,  translation, diaspora, migration and indigeneity; vernacular literary traditions; interrogations of transnationalism,  globalization, secularism and nationalism, as well as critiques of the field itself. Located in one of the world\u2019s most  diverse and dynamic cities, the Postcolonial Studies Project aims to become the New York City area hub for the field,  connecting a variety of researchers, students and visiting scholars, and acting as a forum where they can share their  work.      Inaugurated with the appointment of Robert J.C. Young as NYU Silver Professor of English and Comparative Literature in  2005, the project draws on its core faculty in the English Department\u2014Rajeswari Sunder Rajan, Toral Gajarawala and Jini  Kim Watson\u2014other faculty with interests in various aspects of the field\u2014Patrick Deer, Elaine Freedgood, Crystal Parikh,  Sukhdev Sandhu, Jeff Spear, John Waters\u2014as well as the many renowned academics with related interests from across the  university. In the past few years, the project has grown to become a vibrant site for intellectual exchange and  innovative work in postcolonial studies, broadly conceived. Activities and events organized by those involved in the  project include:             a monthly colloquium with invited speakers, co-ordinated by the graduate students in the department       a monthly seminar held in conjunction with CNRS (Paris)/NYU on the topic of \u2018Postcolonialism and Enlightenment:   An Experiment in Reconstituting Knowledge\u2019       a major international conference in 2008 on \u2018Postcolonialism and the Hit of the Real\u2019       a lecture series on translation studies       student panels and workshops       a teach-in on the international dimensions of the economic crisis       a thriving graduate reading group       a pilot project of an archive of the global South, The Tricontinental Archive       funding for an NYU graduate student in English to attend the inaugural 2009 session of the Johannesburg   Workshop in Theory and Criticism, held at the Witwatersrand Institute for Social and Economic Research (WISER) at   the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa       participation in a collaborate research project with five universities around the world, funded by the   Leverhulme Trust, on \u2018Commodities and Culture, 1851-1914\u2019. The program will include major three-day international   workshops that will be hosted in London(2010), Kolkata (2010/11) and New York (2011)       editing of the journal Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies, whose office is in the   English Department. Opportunities exist for graduate students to work as editorial assistants in the production of   the journal.      Speakers at our conference and colloquia have included: Arjun Appadurai, Homi Bhabha, Pheng Cheah, Nicholas Dirks,  Simon Gikandi, David Lloyd, Achille Mbembe, Alok Rai, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and many others. Drawing on the  expertise of over twenty faculty in other departments at NYU whose interests affiliate with those of postcolonial  studies, other related NYU institutions and centers, as well as primary research materials available in the Bobst  Library, particularly in Caribbean Studies, and elsewhere in New York, the project offers unique opportunities for  collaborative work and cross-disciplinary dialogue as we attempt to further our understanding of the flows and forces  of people, cultures, goods and institutions that make up our complex world - a world that is excitingly visible in the  New York City where we work.         The Project on New York Writing The Project on New York Writing seeks to generate significant  new research and teaching about New York\u2019s relationship to American and global literatures and cultures. We adopt a  broad definition of \u201cNew York writing\u201d to include writing by New Yorkers, writing that takes New York to be its subject  or setting, or simply even writing produced in New York. We use the term \u201cwriting\u201d in contradistinction to the term  \u201cliterature,\u201d because the Project\u2019s purview will extend beyond the genres of poetry, fiction, drama, and literary  nonfiction to embrace such other textual forms as music, journalism, and nonfiction of all kinds.      Interdisciplinary in its approach to literary and cultural studies, the Project examines the evolution of New York City  as a literary construct, as well as the city\u2019s emergence and continual reinvention as one of the country\u2019s\u2014and the  world\u2019s\u2014premier sites of literary and cultural production. Seeking to understand how New York\u2019s cultures, its history,  and even its physical spaces might be understood to function as texts that respond to modes of literary analysis, the  Project aims to demonstrate that literary scholarship can provide vital contributions to urban studies within a wide  range of disciplines in the humanities and social sciences.      New York University is already a significant location for scholars and teachers who work on New York writing. The  University\u2019s Fales Library, with its Downtown Collection, has become the leading site for the study of New York\u2019s  mid-to-late-twentieth century avant-garde culture. NYU offers courses in a variety of departments related to New York  literature and culture, and it currently reaches out both to high school students (through initiatives that originate  in the Steinhardt School of Education) and to professors at teaching colleges in the area and around the country  (through the efforts of the Faculty Resource Network). Reaching beyond the University, the Project aims to collaborate  across academic and archival institutions in the greater metropolitan region and to disseminate new scholarship widely,  both throughout New York City and around the country.      The Project will offer students of New York literature and culture resources with which to interpret the palimpsest  that is New York, to help them make sense of the myriad narratives that the city generates. One of the Project\u2019s chief  aims is conservancy: we hope to preserve the history of New York writing for future generations. But another aim  is the promotion of innovation: we hope to encourage all whom the Initiative serves to add to the living culture of  city, reading and rewriting its narratives, enlarging the literary construct that is New York.      The Project\u2019s founding event, a conference and Fales Library exhibition on the theme \u201cLost New York,\u201d was held at NYU  in the fall of 2009, with support from the Department of English, the NYU Humanities Initiative, and Fales Library and  Special Collections. The Project also co-sponsored a follow-up conference, \u201cKiss Me Again: The Life and Legacy of  Arthur Russell,\u201d directed by Sukhdev Sandhu.      Current publications include a volume of essays that accompanied that \u201cLost New York\u201d exhibition (click here to  download a PDF version of the book) and The Cambridge Companion to the Literature of  New York , edited by Project co-directors Cyrus R. K. Patell and Bryan Waterman. The co-directors also edit the  blog Patell and  Waterman\u2019s History of New York .      Future Project activities include an expansion of undergraduate and graduate course offerings devoted to the history  and culture of the city, building on the success of the department\u2019s signature undergraduate course, Writing New York ; a publication series that will include both new scholarship and  annotated editions of classic New York literary texts; and additional conferences, including a major event in 2014 to  mark the fortieth anniversary of the birth of the New York City punk scene.      Affiliated faculty within the English department include Thomas Augst, Jacqueline Goldsby, Cyrus R. K. Patell  (co-director), Sukhdev Sandhu, Lytle Shaw, and Bryan Waterman (co-director).
