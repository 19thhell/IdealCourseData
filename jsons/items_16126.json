Introduction  to Cinema Studies    CINE-UT  10 First  semester of study. Allen. 4 points.    Designed  to introduce the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies to new majors.  The first goal is to help students develop a range of analytical skills in the  study of film. By the end of the semester, they are fluent in the basic  vocabulary of film form, understand the social questions raised by dominant  modes of cinematic representation, and grasp the mechanics of structuring a  written argument about a film's meaning. The second goal is to familiarize  students with some of the major critical approaches in the field (for example,  narrative theory, feminism, cultural studies, and genre). To this end, readings  and screenings also provide a brief introduction to some critical issues  associated with particular modes of film production and criticism (such as  documentary, narrative, and the avant-garde).          Film  History: Silent Cinema    CINE-UT  15 Second  semester of study. Dibbern. 4 points.    Examines  how the history of cinema has been studied and written by taking the period of  silent film as its case study. Explores the historical and cultural contexts  that governed the emergence of film as art and mass culture. Investigates the  different approaches to narrative filmmaking that developed internationally in  the silent period. Screenings include early cinema, works of Hollywood drama  and comedy, Russian film and Soviet montage cinema, Weimar cinema, and silent  black cinema.          Film  Theory    CINE-UT  16 Third  semester of study. Straayer. 4 points.    Closely  examines a variety of theoretical writings concerned with aesthetic, social,  and psychological aspects of the medium. Students study the writing of classical  theorists such as Eisenstein, Bazin, and Kracauer, as well as such contemporary  thinkers as Metz, Mulvey, and Baudrillard. Questions addressed range from the  nature of cinematic representation and its relationship to other forms of  cultural expression to the way in which cinema shapes our conception of racial  and gender identity.          Television:  History and Culture    CINE-UT  21   Fourth semester of study. McCarthy. 4 points.    Examines  the background, context, and history of radio, television, video, and sound.  Topics include politics and economics of media institutions, audiences and  reception, cultural and broadcast policy, and aesthetic modes and movements.          Advanced  Seminar    CINE-UT  7XX 4  points.    Involves  in-depth study of a specific topic and encourages the student to produce  original research.          Tier  II          See  the Department of Cinema Studies section of the Tisch School of the Arts  Bulletin for a list and descriptions of tier II courses.          Tier  III          Tier  III classes consist of a two-semester sequence in two vital areas of historical  film scholarship: American cinema and international cinema. The fall semester  covers the origins of both areas to 1960; the spring semester will evaluate the  last 50 years in both areas. These classes are open to all students in cinema  studies majors and minors, as well as to all students across the University.  Tier III classes are intended to give all students a well-rounded education in  the history of world cinema.          American  Cinema: Origins to 1960    CINE-UT  50 Offered  in the fall. 4 points.          American  Cinema: 1960 to Present    CINE-UT  51 Offered  in the spring. 4 points. .

See  the Department of Cinema Studies section of the Tisch School of the Arts  Bulletin for current descriptions of Tier III courses.          Tier  IV          Tier  IV courses are small theory and practice courses in writing, film criticism,  and forms of filmmaking. They are open only to cinema studies B.A., M.A.,  and Ph.D. students.          Film  Criticism: Theory &amp; Practice    CINE-UT  600/CINE-GT 1141 4 points.    Examines  the history of American film criticism from the beginning of the silent era to  the present. Focuses on the strategies, theories, concepts and methods American  critics have used in reviewing a variety of films, from mainstream Hollywood  movies to foreign films, indies, and documentaries. Examines differences  between American critics and their European counterparts; the differences  between film criticism and film reviewing; the role of critics as gatekeepers,  tastemakers, and consumer guides; the power of film critics on the film  industry (producers, directors, and actors) and audience; the impact of TV, the  Internet, and social media on film criticism; and the relevance of serious  criticism today. Major critics from such outlets as the New York Times and Salon are invited to  demonstrate their analytic perspective, skills, and writing styles.          Cell  Phone Cinema    CINE-UT  566/CINE-GT 2566 Bardosh. 4 points.    Hollywood  in Your Palm, or Filmmaking by Apps: a historical and critical survey of the  emergence and exponential growth of global \"cell phone cinema\" and a workshop  that gives students the opportunity to become practitioners. Organized into  crews, students shoot footage on cell phone to download for computerized  editing. The final project is comprised of shorts (under three minutes) in a  range of genres: news, mini-documentaries, animation, music videos and  narratives. Completed student projects may be posted on the Internet and  entered into domestic and international mobile phone film festivals to compete  for prizes. It is expected that students bring a smart phone capable of  recording video.          Script  Analysis    CINE-GT  1997 Dancyger.  4 points.    Plot  and character development, dialogue, foreground, background, and story are  examined. Using feature films, we highlight these script elements rather than  the integrated experience of the script, performance, directing, and editing  elements of the film. Assignments include two script analyses.          Writing  Genres: Scriptwriting    CINE-GT  1145 Dancyger.  4 units.    Genre  is all about understanding the different pathways available to the writer for  conveying his or her vision. Genres each have differing character and dramatic  arcs. Students examine different genres and use that knowledge to write two  different genre treatments of their story idea. This is an intermediate-level  screenwriting class.          Independent  Study          Independent  Study    CINE-UT  900 through CINE-UT 905 Prerequisite: written permission of a  faculty adviser. 1 to 4 points per term.

We will consider films from a stylistic, formal, and theoretical perspective, paying special attention to the emergence of modernist and neo-realist inspired stylistic and narrative modes. We will also examine films in relation to their national, historical, industrial and technological context and relative to the particular thematic and artistic concerns of their makers and the communities in which they lived and worked. This course will introduce students to some of the most exciting and challenging films produced within the past fifty years and encourage them to think critically about film aesthetics and narrative structure, national and historical context, and the process of film production. In-class screenings will include films by: Jean-Luc Godard, Nagisa Oshima, Michelangelo Antonioni, Glauber Rocha, Rainer Warner Fassbinder, Chris Marker, John Woo, and Abbas Kiarostami.

Course Level: Intermediate No prerequisite       This course will focus on international filmmaking practice since 1960, with special emphasis on \u201cnew waves\u201d and other contemporary film movements within a variety of national cinemas. We will consider films from a stylistic, formal, and theoretical perspective, paying special attention to the emergence of modernist and neo-realist inspired stylistic and narrative modes. We will also examine films in relation to their national, historical, industrial and technological context and relative to the particular thematic and artistic concerns of their makers and the communities in which they lived and worked. This course will introduce students to some of the most exciting and challenging films produced within the past fifty years and encourage them to think critically about film aesthetics and narrative structure, national and historical context, and the process of film production. In-class screenings will include films by: Jean-Luc Godard, Nagisa Oshima, Michelangelo Antonioni, Glauber Rocha, Rainer Warner Fassbinder, Chris Marker, John Woo, and Abbas Kiarostami.

Phillips  Department of Cinema Studies      CALL #: 75691      Monday 6:20PM -  9:50 p.m.      Over the last 50 years the American  Cinema has produced a remarkably rich abundance of entertaining, exciting, and  challenging films. This course is designed to provide a survey of the wealth of  styles, forms, purposes, and approaches to filmmaking that developed and  emerged in this era. While Hollywood  has obviously served as the dominant mode of filmmaking in this country, a  significant diversity of other filmmaking practices have continued to operate  and sometimes thrive outside of it. Beyond the attention paid to Hollywood narrative cinema as it has changed and evolved  over this half-century, we will also consider documentaries, avant-garde and  experimental works, independent narrative cinema, and \u2015cult\u2016  films. Consequentially, we will be screening a variety of films, including works  by such notable American filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola,  Quentin Tarantino, George Romero, John Singleton, and Michael Moore.
