ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.

ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.

ADVANCED ELECTIVE COURSES       Two (2) courses must be taken to satisfy the major requirement, one (1) for the minor.    All advanced elective courses have prerequisites in addition to Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1). Please see individual courses for additional information. Special Topics courses are offered every semester in a variety of areas. The Special Topics courses listed below represent a sampling of recently offered courses.            TEACHING IN PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 2)    Prerequisites: Admittance by application only            SEMINAR IN MEMORY (PSYCH-UA 23)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 29    Examination of the conceptual problems involved in understanding the retention of information. Reviews research findings addressed to those problems, involving studies with humans and sub-humans and with environmental, psychological, and biochemical variables.            LANGUAGE AND MIND (PSYCH-UA 27/LING-UA 28)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 29.    Introduces students to the field of cognitive science through an examination of language behavior, one of the major domains of inquiry in the discipline. Begins with interactive discussions of how best to characterize and study the mind. These principles are then illustrated through an examination of research and theories related to language representation and use. The course draws from research in both formal linguistics and psycholinguistics.            ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 51)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 32 or 34.    The kinds, dynamics, causes, and treatment of psychopathology. Topics include early concepts of abnormal behavior; affective disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis, and personality disorders; the nature and effectiveness of traditional and modern methods of psychotherapy; and viewpoints of major psychologists past and present.            PSYCHOLINGUISTICS (PSYCH-UA 56)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or LING-UA 1    Examines theories and research concerning the cognitive processes and linguistic representations that enable language comprehension and production. Topics include speech perception, visual processes during reading, word recognition, syntactic processing, and semantic/discourse processing.            ADVANCED SEMINAR IN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 61)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 22 or NEURL-UA 100 and 220.    The objective of this course is to master select topics in perceptual psychology and sensory neuroscience, focusing on visual perception, visual neuroscience and computational neuroscience. This is an interdisciplinary field of science, crossing the boundaries between psychology, biology, physics and engineering. This course is intended for neural science majors and psychology majors that are on track for careers in science and medicine. This course is also appropriate for students in the psychology master\u2019s degree program. Topics include: neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; psychophysics; neuroimaging; linear systems theory; signal detection theory; light and the eye; physiology and anatomy of the retina; color vision; pattern and texture perception; perception of depth; visual motion perception; attention and awareness.            INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (PSYCH-UA 62)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10 and 30 or 32 or 34 or 36.    The focus will be on psychology as applied to work, as well as human behavior from the perspective of employees and employers. The course will explore three levels: - the individual, the team, and the organization as a whole. Topics covered will include: employee engagement, satisfaction, identify, esteem, and career interests; hiring and firing; and. motivating and rewarding staff to increase performance and productivity.     Managing human capital from the firm\u2019s perspective involves work-environment culture and climate, and productivity improvement to develop the healthiest organization. Special topics will include the rise in conflict and employee violence, as well as the growing difficulty with work-life balance, diversity, technology and social media opportunities and challenges. We will look at individual differences involved in psychological assessment and testing for recruiting, transfer, promotion and termination. The objective in I/O Psychology is to achieve a balance between employees\u2019 wants and needs, and the firm\u2019s business imperatives.     This class is best suited to those with an interest in and appreciation for business, economics, and quantitative analysis (e.g. Statistics) for informed business decision-making. Those considering careers in Human Resources or advanced graduate study in Psychology and Business will find relevance.                MOTIVATION AND VOLITION (PSYCH-UA 74)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 and 32    The course provides an overview of the major theories and findings in research on motivation and volition. More specifically, we will address the history of research on motivation and volition, classic phenomena of being motivated versus lacking motivation and willpower, the psychology of goals (goal setting, goal implementation, effortful goal pursuits, disengagement, content and structure of goals, the mental representation of goals), disorders of self-regulation, and cognitive-neuropsychological research as well as the perspective of economics on motivation and volition. We will focus on understanding the interrelations and contradictions between the different approaches, and on designing research that promotes these different lines of thinking.            CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 32    Close relationships are at the core of the human experience. You already have extensive experience with relationships of many sorts \u2013 family bonds, friendships, and probably romantic partnerships as well. The objective of this course is to introduce you to the scientific perspective of close relationships. You will learn how research psychologists apply the scientific method of data collection and analysis to investigate how people experience and think about relationships in general, and romantic relationships specifically. What makes someone attractive? Do we each have one true love out there or is the person you end up with determined by who happens to be around? Is it better to see your romantic partner for who they really are or to see them through rose-colored glasses? How do relationships influence the way you see yourself? This course will address these and related questions from a social psychological perspective.            COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 34    This course will examine how children's thinking develops from infancy through childhood. We will discuss how children develop knowledge and reasoning skills across various domains (e.g., how children learn and think about objects, people, the natural world, and society) and we will examine the major theories and explanations of cognitive growth. This course will include consideration of both classic and contemporary research on cognitive development.            COGNEURO: PRINCIPLES OF FRONTAL LOBE FUNCTIONS (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 or 29.    The frontal cortex is thought to be a key cortical area important for the integration of sensory and motor information. Many cognitive and emotional facets of our behavior that make us unique as humans are thought to depend on the frontal cortex, which accounts for almost 1/3 of the cortical surface of the entire brain. In this course we will delve into the issues that have led many clinicians and scientists throughout the years to suspect that the key to understanding what makes us uniquely human depends on understanding the frontal cortex. We will cover important neuropsychological patient studies and theories as well as human and animal empirical studies into the structure and physiology of the frontal lobes as they relate to higher cognitive functions.     Two \u2018mock\u2019 endeavors are emphasized in the class and form the majority of basis for evaluation, the oral communication of research results and the written proposal of a research grant.            DATA LITERACY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    We now live in a world where data is ubiquitous and increasingly influential on decision making at all levels of society. However, most people are not able to meaningfully partake in this new world because they are not data-literate. Thus, the goal of this course is to develop data literacy - the ability to obtain, manage, analyze and understand data. Acquiring this critical skill-set unlocks a wide range of career opportunities and provides the foundation of an educated citizenry in the modern world, preparing you for a successful life in a data-based society. To attain this goal, this course provides a gentle introduction to data-related topics, with a particular emphasis on providing a conceptual understanding, actionable knowledge and long-term retention.            EXPERIMENTS IN BEAUTY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    Beauty is famously hard to study scientifically, but students in this hands-on laboratory course will each week formulate beauty-related questions and design and implement experiments to answer them. We also read and discuss one article/chapter each week from authors including Kant, Woolf, Berlin, Donoghue, Kuhn, Quine, and Wittgenstein.            HUMAN SEXUALITY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1    Sexuality is an essential aspect of everyone\u2019s life. It leads to our most important relationships \u2013 with lovers, spouses, and children. It drives much of our social-networking and status seeking behavior. It evokes our strongest passions - lust, love, jealousy, heartbreak, despair, and hope. And depending on a variety of factors, it can be a highly pleasurable experience that enriches our lives, or a destructive force causing physical, mental, and interpersonal suffering. Basic sexual potentials and tendencies have been built into the human species by evolutionary forces. At the same time, processes of socialization and learning play a crucial role in how these basic potentials are developed, experienced, and manifested in each of us.     Sexual science encompasses a large and multi-disciplinary field of theory and research. This course will examine human sexuality primarily from a psychological perspective, drawing on empirical and theoretical work from the fields of personality, developmental, social, clinical, evolutionary, and cognitive psychology, and less often also from ethology, anthropology, sociology, history, neurobiology, and public policy. It will cover various aspects of human sexual psychology (sexual capacities, desires, attraction, orientation, attitudes, identities, experiences, and relationships) and how they are shaped by biological, environmental, and socio-cultural factors over the course of the human lifespan, from conception to old age. We will also examine theories and methods of sex research, atypical sexualities, sexual dysfunctions, sexual coercion, and the qualities and benefits of good sex.            FROM ILLUSIONS TO INFERENCE: ADVENTURES IN HUMAN PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: NONE    Our sensory perception easily falls prey to illusions and biases. It is tempting to think of these as failures of our brain, but they might not be! In fact, they reveal the difficult challenges that our brain faces when interpreting the world, and the clever (and sometimes not so clever) solutions that it comes up with.      In this course, we will use a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known illusions (visual, auditory, tactile, vestibular, and multisensory) to work towards the central concept of inference: the notion that the brain constantly forms hypotheses about the outside world and computes probabilities over those hypotheses.   We will draw parallels with fun examples from online shopping to medical diagnosis to spam filtering to election forecasting to searching for submarines. There will be a guest lecture about neurological disorders of perception.   We welcome not only students in psychology and neuroscience, but also from other fields (including biology, physics, computer science, economics, marketing, mathematics, and engineering).            LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1 or Instructor Permission    In the first three years of life, children go from helpless creatures, fresh out of the womb, to toddlers with a basic grasp of language and the people and objects in the world around them. How do they do that? This seminar will discuss current issues in language acquisition and cognitive development, exploring nature, nurture, and their interaction.            NEUROECONOMICS AND DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 25 or 29.    This course explores how humans and animals make decisions, drawing broadly on many perspectives including particularly the nexus of psychological, neuroscientific, and economic considerations, but also ethological and computational ones. The course is organized around modules considering decision making in several sorts of tasks; for instance, by foraging animals or by humans in competitive multiplayer interactions.            PREJUDICE AND STEREOTYPING (PSYCH-UA 300)    This course will cover historical and contemporary scientific approaches to understanding prejudice, specifically prejudice that exists between social groups (for example, ethnic prejudice, religious prejudice, etc.) across different cultures. Readings will draw from multiple social scientific perspectives, and will cover topics including the origins of prejudice, the justification of prejudice, the different forms of prejudicial expression, the identification of prejudice in individuals and institutions, the consequences of being a victim of prejudice, and the value (or not) of different prejudice reduction strategies.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ACTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    In the last decade, there has been a surge of research on the mechanisms of human action. This seminar covers most of the basic questions regarding human action: What are the mechanisms by which action plans are acquired (learned), mentally represented, activated, selected, and expressed? The seminar addresses research on motor control, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, psycholinguistics, biology, as well as cognitive, developmental, social, and motivational psychology. The seminar thus adheres to a multidisciplinary perspective on the analysis of human action.            PSYCHOLOGY OF ADDICTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 1    This course will provide: (1) an overview of the major substances of abuse; (2) a review of the various psychological approaches to understanding substance use, abuse, and addiction as informed by the cognitive-behavioral, psychodynamic, and behavioral traditions; (3) an in-depth exploration of the major forms of addiction treatment; and (4) an application of this knowledge to the non-substance or behavioral addictions such as pathological gambling and addictive sexuality.            SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10    This course is aimed at undergraduates who are planning to attend graduate school in psychology or one of the other behavioral sciences. There are few commercially available solutions that are versatile enough to fulfill the diverse needs of researchers in the behavioral sciences. Thus, it is increasingly critical that aspiring research practitioners are capable of doing their own scientific programming and computing. This class is designed to impart these capabilities to aspiring researchers in the behavioral sciences - specifically Psychology - who have no background in programming, computer science or any prior exposure to any programming language. To achieve this goal, we will cover the computational and programming needs across the entire research cascade in the behavioral sciences, from data collection to making publication quality figures. This is a hands-on class with a focus on developing practical skills in scientific computing and programming, helping you to pursue your future research goals. Language of instruction is Matlab and some Python.            SELF AND SOCIAL JUDGMENT (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    How is the self-concept formed and how do we come to know other people? Students will discuss the role of motivations, cognitive errors and biases, culture, and situational and dispositional influences on how we think about ourselves and other people.            SEMINAR IN THINKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 29    This seminar focuses in depth on a single aspect of thinking: decision making. Decision making is a critical part of every person\u2019s life, as we make decisions about major life events such as what college to go to (if any), whether to get married, or what career to follow, down to trivial decisions about which bagel to order or where to sit in a class. We will examine formal theories of how people /should/ make decisions, as well as many studies on whether people are good or even rational decision makers. The class is a seminar, and active discussion and class participation are expected.            SOCIAL ATTITUDES (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 32    This course will provide an overview of the major theoretical debates and empirical developments in the area of attitudes and evaluation. Students in this class will be directly exposed to many of the core ideas in attitude research by reading many of the classic articles in this literature. The readings will provide an in-depth exploration of key empirical and theoretical breakthroughs. For example, we will explore implicit and explicit attitude-measurement, persuasion, prejudice, and how attitudes shape our thoughts and actions. Students in the course will also discover the relevance of the attitude-theory to situations of everyday life.            SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 22 and 25 and 30 or 32. PSYCH-UA 29 recommended.    This course provides an overview of topics in the emerging field of Social Neuroscience. We will focus on how theories and methods of neuroscience may be used to address classic questions of social psychology from new and informative angles. The goal of this course is to give you a broad background in social neuroscience so that you may (a) be a critical consumer of this literature, (b) broaden the way you think about connections between the mind, brain, and behavior in the context of the social world, and (c) most importantly, apply these ideas to inform your own ideas and future research in psychology.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF DECISION MAKING (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 29 or 32    This course will review theory and research on cognitive and motivational processes underlying judgments and decision making regarding social objects and events. The course will examine how people seek, interpret, and integrate information in making social judgments and decisions. The seminar will discuss models of rational judgment and how cognitive limitations, social stereotypes, emotions, desires, and impulses produce judgmental error and biases. The course will examine how these judgmental phenomena are expressed in everyday life situations.            SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF VISUAL PERCEPTION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 1 and 10.    People tacitly assume that they see the world exactly how it is. New research, however, calls this assumption into question and instead suggests our vantage is clouded at best. In this seminar, we discuss research that suggests that visual perception is influenced by the perceiver's cognitions, emotions, goals, motivations, culture, surroundings, and other variables that have been traditionally considered exclusive to social, personality, and cognitive psychology. Students taking this course will read and evaluate the original literature related to these topics. Weekly response papers will inform class discussion of papers. A final paper will be required.            SYSTEMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 30 or 51.    This course will introduce students to the nature of psychotherapy. It will consider the major theories and techniques of psychotherapy, with particular emphasis on psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral approaches. A significant portion of the course will be devoted to viewing and discussing videos illustrating different methods of psychotherapy. .           SOCIAL VISION (PSYCH-UA 300)    Prerequisites: PSYCH-UA 10 and 32    We tacitly assume perceptions are veridical representations of reality, that the way we see the world reflects the way it really is. In this class, we discuss research that calls this supposition into question. We will investigate the ways in which and reasons why higher-order, top-down influences constrain perception at multiple stages of perceptual processing including eye movements, directing visual attention, filtration, ambiguity resolution, and interpretation. Moreover, we discuss the implications of social vision for consequential behavior and judgment in domains including jury decision making, policing, relationships, health and fitness, politics, and others.            RESEARCH EXPERIENCES AND METHODS (PSYCH-UA 999)    Offered Every Semester. Prerequisites: Permission of Department and PSYCH-UA 10 as well as two (2) other psychology core courses and a GPA of at least 3.0. This course may be repeatable for credit.   Undergraduate students are paired with faculty, advanced graduate students, or other researchers on a one-to-one basis to pursue common research goals in psychology. Undergraduates serve as apprentices on survey, laboratory, clinical, and field research projects and in return receive guidance in reading and developing research skills. Biweekly meetings deal with research methods and design and allow students an opportunity to speak on their research projects. Written assignments include several brief homeworks and a final journal-style research report.               HONORS COURSES    Open only to students who have been admitted to the Psychology Honors Program. Either PSYCH-UA 200 or PSYCH-UA 201 (but not both) may be counted as an advanced elective in the fulfillment of the requirements of the major.            HONORS SEMINAR I (PSYCH-UA 200)    Offered Every Fall. Prerequisite: Admission to the psychology honors program.    Students read and discuss recent studies and classical papers related to current controversies in psychology. A portion of class time is set aside for discussion of theoretical and technical aspects of each student's thesis project.            HONORS SEMINAR II (PSYCH-UA 201)    Offered Every Spring. Prerequisite: PSYCH-UA 200.    A continuation of PSYCH-UA 200. Students are also expected to present preliminary results of their thesis projects and interpret their findings.               GRADUATE COURSES OPEN TO UNDERGRADUATES    Certain graduate courses are open to advanced undergraduates who satisfy the following prerequisites: Junior or Senior major in Psychology, permission of the student's undergraduate psychology advisor, permission of the Department of Psychology (graduate division), and additional specific prerequisites listed for each course.

The interpretative classes will run concurrently with production management, sights and sound, and post-production workshops. The course will have three objectives: (1) teach students the documentary tradition from Flaherty to Rouch; (2) use critical Cinema theory to define a document with a camera; and (3) create a short documentary film.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Kwame Nkrumah: \u00a0A Critical Examination of His Life and Times -\u00a0SCA-UA 9181 \u00a0- 4 points                               This is an interdisciplinary course designed to study the life and times, intellectual thought and practical activity, of Ghana\u2019s first president, Kwame Nkrumah. With the use of a variety of readings and audio-visual materials, this course will critically explore the socioeconomic and political factors that served to shape the life, thought, and times of Kwame Nkrumah. The persons, ideas, and events that influenced Nkrumah and the ideas, persons and events that he also impacted will be covered as well. Students interested in sociology, history, political science, economics, and cultural studies will find this course of particular interest as its subject matter will dovetail into each of these related fields of study.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Society, Culture and Modernization in Ghana - SCA-UA\u00a09776 - 4 points                               The course introduces students to aspects of Ghanaian society and culture. It considers both traditional aspects of life and how people live their lives in this first decade of the new millennium. How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class. There will be a written examination at the end of the semester and a dissertation on an aspect of Ghanaian society and culture that students might choose to explore.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Colonialism and the Rise of Modern African Literature - COLIT-UA 9850 or SCA-UA\u00a09781 - 4 points                               Note: this course is open to all students for elective credit. Comparative   literature majors in track ii (literary and cultural studies) may count this   course toward one of their non-core major requirements.   The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Intensive Twi Language Course -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a0GHAN.002 - 4 points                               This is a language course designed to provide basic communicative competence in oral and written Twi for beginners.

Sample Syllabus                          Back to top              Anthropology          Prague                                                    Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3.

The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

Rappers shoot videos in art galleries. Biennials  proliferate, art fairs geographically expand, and auction sales hit new records. At the  same time, public arts funding is systematically slashed, emerging artists still struggle,  and art criticism remains in its perpetual crisis. The international contemporary art  world is a convoluted interplay of aesthetics and economics; ego and idealism. Berlin\u2019s  art world may be more production-based and experimental than the art scenes of other  major western cities, but it is still a microcosm of larger movements.  Through readings of art theory and criticism, discussions, site visits, guest speakers,  and short- and long-form response writing, this course offers an overview of the  conventions, trends, history, current developments and myriad structures and  substructures of the contemporary art world in general and Berlin\u2019s in particular. The  course delves into contemporary art\u2019s current prevailing discourse via methodological  analysis, practical observation, and input from professionals currently working in the  art\u2019s institutional and commercial sectors. It also offers a critical look at how these  larger art-world structures translate to Berlin.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.

The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century.

The city of Florence will be the classroom as students study the masters, explore museums, examine texts, and analyze the historical significance of monuments. With eyes cast simultaneously on painting, the graphic arts, sculpture, and architecture, this class will explore a broad range of art patronage that included religious and civic bodies, princely courts, and a growing number of private clients. The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making. Works will be examined on their native terms: both as physical objects, with sensitivity to their particular function and intended reception, and as visual images active within larger contexts.

When speaking of great contemporary patrons of the arts, we often hear someone called \u201ca modern Medici.\u201d What exactly does this phrase mean and how did the family name of the principal banking house of Renaissance Florence become synonymous with the sponsorship of cultural endeavors? This course attempts to answer these questions and others by examining the development of Medici patronage from the emergence of the family as a political force at the dawn of the Renaissance to the establishment of the grand ducal dynasty that reigned for almost two centuries in Florence. The commissions of Cosimo the Elder, Piero the Gouty, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the two Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and the first three Medic Grand Dukes (Cosimo I, Francesco I and Ferdinando I) are given particular emphasis. Issues such as familial pietas, the power and influence of Medici women and the varying political climate in Florence and Rome are also considered as fundamental to the development of characteristically Medicean patterns of patronage.    The role of the patron in determining the ultimate appearance of works of art and architecture is given primary consideration here. The Medici are therefore considered as a test case for understanding the importance of patronage for the history of Renaissance art. This may be best examined through the Medici\u2019s continued patronage of certain artists over extended periods of time. The works of artists such as Brunelleschi, Michelozzo, Donatello, Fra Angelico, Michelangelo, Bandinelli, Vasari and Buontalenti, all of whom produced significant numbers of works under the aegis of the Medici, are therefore the main focus of the lectures, class discussions and site visits. Comparison of Medici modes of patronage with local would-be rivals or imitators and with great foreign patrons will help to provide a measure of what is both characteristic of all Renaissance patrons and what is unique to the Medici themselves.

London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.

British designers are playing an increasingly important part on the world stage. This course examines changing attitudes to design in Britain: from the eighteenth century, when it played a central role in the modernisation of the country, to the Millennium and beyond, when it is being called upon to rekindle some lost glory. We will ask whether there are features about British design over the last 250 years which are distinctively British; and to what extent British designers have been informed by developments in the rest of the world.   Design now seems all-encompassing, and this very fact also raises broader questions. Have we overvalued this work of the mind over more traditional hand-skills? Are we becoming cynical in the face of endless &quot;rebrandings&quot; (which includes the rebranding of cities and whole countries)? Does design necessarily falsify, or paper over the cracks? And is it good for the planet?   The course format consists of Lectures, and Visits to museums, London sites etc.                                                                    Seeing London's Architecture -\u00a0ARTH-UA\u00a09674 or SASEM-UG 9250 - 4 points                               Students in the NYU Art History Dept: This course counts for Architecture and Urban Design credit only .   London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Beginning with the grandeur of Paris during the Belle Epoque and the Exposition Universelle of 1900, and moving to the violence and tragedy of World Wars I and II, this course examines the French modernist art movements of the first part of the 20th century. After identifying the origins of modernism in the late 19th century with Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, we will consider the ways in which Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, and Primitivism redefined modernism for the 20th century. Working with Dada and Surrealist art works, we will evaluate the relationship between humor, critique, and cultural and political dissension in artistic production. Finally, we will examine the trans-Atlantic currents of Abstraction, looking at Abstract Expressionism, L\u2019Art Informel, and the Nouveau Realistes. Throughout this exploration, we will interrogate how social history, shaped by politics, gender, and race, informed the construction of an artistic modernism in the 20th century.

Paris of the 19th and early 20th centuries developed into a major urban center, in part because of the promise of liberty that drew people there following the upheavals of the Revolution. The urban renewal that occurred under the Second Empire in the mid-19th century in particular transformed the capital into a modern city of innovation and spectacle. While the official arts reflected the tastes and priorities of successive governments and the emergent bourgeoisie, it was the avant-garde that most marked the city as a site of resistance and daring. In this course we study these different art movements as they relate to the city of Paris, studying the sites, movements, and transformations that helped shape the modern arts. Conducted in French.

London on the Thames takes close runner-up position. But more than mythic, popular-culture stage sets, these two great European capitals operate as spectacular rival models in face of real-life, 21st-century dramas. Our course concentrates on a sequence of case studies targeting the evolving architecture and urban plan of Paris. We focus on current thematic debates crucial to its identity, survival and future\u2014tradition contra innovation, continuity contra rupture, preservation contra demolition, obsolescence contra revitalization. We investigate controversies over the low- and high-density city; legislation on building heights, protection of skyline and riverbanks; the interface between historic and experimental building types; the balance between public and private space, residential and mixed-economy neighbourhoods, inner-city rehabilitation and suburban sprawl; intra- and extra-muros transportation systems (road, rail, river, air). As a foil and finale to our Paris studies, we conclude with a critical comparative analysis of contemporary London to illuminate fundamental differences between these two global cities: the rational French model largely tempered by state control against the exuberant English model predominantly driven by ultra-liberal policies. Will the third millennium ideal city emerge as a polymorphic combination of the two approaches? Conducted in English .

Financial systems are centered on key institutions, instruments and markets. But they  also involve governments, public policy and regulation. They span the globe from the  US, the EU and Japan to Russia, China and the Emerging Markets. In critical ways,  country-level financial architectures are integrating to form a more seamless, high-performance whole. This is good for efficiency, innovation and growth, yet it also  amplifies problems during times of crisis   This course provides students with a broad and rigorous understanding of (i) How the  global financial system works and what purposes it serves, (ii) What the major elements  are and how they operate, and (iii) What challenges the global financial system creates  for public policy makers. In seeking to achieve these objectives, this broad-gauge  course provides a perspective that helps students understand and make the most of  their own professional opportunities. Along with a working knowledge of the global  macroeconomy, foundations of finance and corporate finance, this course will be  extremely helpful for students as a lens to focus on the key dimensions of the modern  business environment.

The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.

Contemporary Art in Britian. Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? We consider some key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries, exploring art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography, representations of the body, gallery display, video practice, and installation art. Topics include how contemporary art came to look as it does, with a focus on British art; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; and how markets, national prizes, and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries, and issues of curation. Critical and historical writings by artists and theorists will be considered.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d     Sample Syllabus (PDF)                          Back to top              Comparative Literature          Accra                                                    African Women Speak - COLIT-UA 9666 - 4 points                               This course shall focus on the place of women in the literary tradition, an issue that is very current in the discourse on the literature of Africa and its Diaspora. Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                          Florence                                                  Topics in 19th Century Literature: Italy and Italians in English Literature from the Romantics to Modernism - COLIT-UA 9180 or SASEM-UG 9201 - 4 points                               Romantic, Victorian, and Modernist writers in both Britain and the United States were fascinated by Italy. The &quot;Italy and Italians&quot; of the title refers not only to images and characters in the works of the British and American authors we will be reading but also to their affinities with Italian literature. Recurring themes in the course will be history and its uses in literature, gender and sexuality, democracy and aristocracy, language and power, and religion as an instrument of sexual repression.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

Other case studies will focus on Brecht\u2019s epic theater, theater during the Third Reich, postwar theater trends in East and West Germany, and current developments in reunified Germany. Not only will we closely read relevant plays and theory by the theater makers of the respective periods but we will also explore aesthetics and performance issues as they have changed over time. As the involved practice of dramaturgy in Germany has greatly influenced theatrical developments, we will investigate this major aspect of theatrical work in Germany as a contribution to world theater and study how the extensive debate of ideas is being concretely realized in the theater through the choices being made in a production. An integral part of the course will include visits to Berlin theaters, attending performances, which we will analyze in class, and engaging in discussion with contemporary theater makers in Berlin.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein And Dracula. This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

This course, designed to introduce students to the range of 20th-century drama staged in the contemporary London theater scene, presents a wide variety of British, American, and multicultural works currently playing. Students analyze the history of the modern theatre in London. Emphasis is placed on comparative interpretation of texts and the dramatic performances of works.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Writing London -\u00a0ENGL-UA\u00a09182 - 4 points                               This course will study a variety of texts written at particular times in the history of London. The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.

Postcolonial Indian Literature - ENGL-UA 9975 - 4 points                               This course explores the meaning of colonialism and postcolonialism in India by examining its historical background, its main themes and its defining problems. The course introduces students to some of the key texts of British cultural and educational policy in India. It also gives students the opportunity to examine a major ethnographic text. The course will then grapple with a cross-section of colonial and postcolonial literary representations of India. The focus here will be on issues of identity and strategies of narrative in colonialist and nationalist texts. The course concludes with an overall view of postcolonial studies as it relates to India and some suggestions as to its future developments.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text? What literary genres and styles are called forth by the huge ecological challenges of our times?

After a brief recap of the basics of policy making in the EU, students will learn about the guiding principles and developments within EU environmental policy, the main actors and their interests in and influence on policy making. An optional part of the course might be a visit to the European House of the European Commission (EC) in Berlin where students either have the opportunity to role-play the decision-making process of the EC on the introduction of CO2-standards for cars or to engage in a debate with an EC representative. The second half of the course analyses EU environmental policies in different issue areas (e.g. climate change, biodiversity, waste) for their effectiveness in solving environmental problems. Different policy instruments are discussed for their merits and shortcomings (one example will be the EU Emissions Trading System) and linkages to other issue areas of EU policy making (e.g. industry and agriculture) are discussed. Finally, the course provides an international perspective on EU environmental policy making: sessions will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of EU environmental policy making at home and in international negotiations, compare it with US environmental politics, and discuss future challenges (e.g. EU enlargement) and trends for EU environmental governance.

What makes them effective or ineffective? This course analyses the various social movements that organized in response to environmental concerns. Both historical and sociological dimensions of environmental movements are covered, with particular attention given to how issues of environmental protection and social justice intersect. At NYU Berlin, the course includes American (I), European, and in particular German (II), as well as global movements (III).

As a result, the world\u2019s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to examine the environmental and cological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams will use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the Global Network University initiative this course will be offered simultaneously in multiple locations and students will collaborate with their counterparts on other campuses.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

This course discusses these questions, as well as others that advance our understanding of the role of environment in Australian history. Questions include: How are environments incorporated into the tool kit of historians? How are environments incorporated into the tool kit of historians? What counts for evidence? Topics include tourism, floods, food, rural and urban environments, acclimatisation and the introduction of plant and animal species over the nineteenth century.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.

The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.

While the approach and methods are interdisciplinary, the main emphasis is on literary theory (explaining and applying basic literary terms), literary history (both American and European), and literary criticism (analyzing different responses to given works). Every class starts with the oral presentation delivered by a student, then there is a short lecture by the teacher, and a discussion follows.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

In this course, we study the great works of French theatre, from the classics to the very  contemporary, through readings, performances, and visits in and around Paris to the lieux  de m\u00e9moire of the theatre world. Through the study of works by Corneille, Moli\u00e8re, Hugo,  Feydeau, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and others, we consider how Paris has been integral to and  shaped by the world of French theatre. Visits include such prestigious venues as the Com\u00e9die  Fran\u00e7aise, the grands boulevards where Parisians discovered Shakespeare in the age of Sarah  Bernhardt, the remains of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Marais where Corneille performed his plays, or  Versailles where Moli\u00e8re helped lead the grand spectacle that was life under Louis XIV.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      Studies in Prose Genres: Post-Colonial Readings of Classic Texts - FREN-UA 9833 or COLIT-UA 9125 - 4 points                               In this course we focus on four contemporary novels in which the world of the character, the narrator, or the author, is read through the lens of a literary classic. In each case, the reading and rewriting of the primary text involves temporal and spatial displacements (from the 18th to the 20th century, from Europe to the Caribbean and to the South Pacific) that generate shifting perspectives and a constant reshuffling of center and periphery. Between a reverential affiliation to the past and a creative misreading and rewriting of it, these intertextual encounters with \u00ab great \u00bb Western literary works insistently raise the questions of identity, originality, and \u201cwriting back\u201d. Exploring these questions will therefore also involve drawing on comparative, translation, and postcolonial studies.

The second part of the course is devoted to an exploration of gender as a political issue during the past 20 years, through consideration of such topics as parit\u00e9, prostitution, colonialism, post-colonialism, and queer studies.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

This course wants to introduce you to the study of German cinema by looking at changing images of the city since the postwar period. The course will begin with an introduction to film analysis, giving special attention to the relationship between film and city. We will go on to discuss a number of influential productions from East, West and reunified Germany, and draw comparisons to other German as well as non-German city films. Through seminar discussions, reading responses, and critical essays, you will gain an understanding of how the cinema has engaged with the city of Berlin and its transformations since the end of the Second World War.

After a brief recap of the basics of policy making in the EU, students will learn about the guiding principles and developments within EU environmental policy, the main actors and their interests in and influence on policy making. An optional part of the course might be a visit to the European House of the European Commission (EC) in Berlin where students either have the opportunity to role-play the decision-making process of the EC on the introduction of CO2-standards for cars or to engage in a debate with an EC representative. The second half of the course analyses EU environmental policies in different issue areas (e.g. climate change, biodiversity, waste) for their effectiveness in solving environmental problems. Different policy instruments are discussed for their merits and shortcomings (one example will be the EU Emissions Trading System) and linkages to other issue areas of EU policy making (e.g. industry and agriculture) are discussed. Finally, the course provides an international perspective on EU environmental policy making: sessions will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of EU environmental policy making at home and in international negotiations, compare it with US environmental politics, and discuss future challenges (e.g. EU enlargement) and trends for EU environmental governance.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

Two sections, one in each city, will meet and collaborate simultaneously via internet to address several key questions: How are art and politics understood and expressed differently and similarly in these two American metropolises and why? How do shared aesthetic features of public art reflect the global circulation of urban creative modes? What do we learn about local politics from looking at the art and writing on a city\u2019s public spaces? Teams of students in both cities will conduct field work in selected neighborhoods to help create an archive of murals, graffiti, performances, and installations. Then, drawing from readings in history, art criticism, and urban studies, as well as from census and electoral data and using GIS technology, we will analyze how social and political processes like gentrification, inequality, and planning generate and reflect creative political expression as captured in our database, culminating in transnational, collaborative projects that explore what wisdom and truths America's streets continue to reveal, 500 years after conquest.

This course explores the development of fashion as an integral part of Italian identity. It looks at four historical moments or movements that played a significant role in developing that identity: Renaissance Florence under the de Medici, Mussolini\u2019s mandate for Italian-based fashion, the post-war Italian film industry in the 1950s and 60s, and, today\u2019s global fashion industry where the image of Italian style is one of quality, luxury and sexy elegance.

Global Fashion Industry: Italy will provide students with a deep understanding of the contemporary fashion industry in Italy, as well as of Italy's position in the global fashion arena. The course will drive students through the entire lifecycle of the fashion business, from forecasting trends to retailing, through design, sourcing, product development and production. Particular attention will be dedicated to different marketing aspects of the process, such as: identity building, brand positioning, merchandising, buying, costing, communication. All levels of retail, from luxury to mass market will be covered. The course will end with an analysis of the new challenges, such as sourcing globalization, emerging markets, sustainability and growing significance of technology.  A strong effort will be put into organizing site visits to studios, showrooms and factories, as well as meeting with professional players.   Each session will be structured to give students an overview of a particular stage of the Industry, through a mix of lectures from the course leader and visiting professionals, studio and showroom visits, walking tours, reading assignments and practical projects.

The &quot;Italy and Italians&quot; of the title refers not only to images and characters in the works of the British and American authors we will be reading but also to their affinities with Italian literature. Recurring themes in the course will be history and its uses in literature, gender and sexuality, democracy and aristocracy, language and power, and religion as an instrument of sexual repression.

This 15 week course will take an in-depth yet wide-ranging look at an important but curiously neglected aspect of modern western visual culture. Within a broadly chronological structure, topics to be dealt with will include the following: the relationship between art and atrocity, and the attendant problem of the aestheticisation of horror; the crucial influence of photography and the growth of mass communications; the issue of censorship, both external and internal, and the related issue of the &quot;limits of representation&quot; (above all, in relation to the Holocaust and Hiroshima); the distinction between official and unofficial war art, and between art and propaganda, between art that endorses and even glorifies war and an art of protest; issues of gender and sexuality; questions of cultural memory and the memorialization process, and the representation of war in contemporary art practice.   It will consist of a combination of informal lectures, student presentations, at least one gallery visit, and the occasional film showing.

This is a course that explores the relationship between ideas, the body and the way that fashion can be understood to mediate between the two. Through a range of disciplines and media this course considers the body as an aspect of not only medical and scientific exploration, but crucially as a vital element of culture and society. Bodies affect the ways in which the social world and power relations are organised, and they even arguably condition the way that we understand reality itself. Our physical form is constantly shaped according to both philosophies and fashions. Body ideals and broader ideals often interrelate strongly through bodily practices and with what we wear. There are meanings and fashions in all bodily forms (skinny, buxom, muscular, ideas of \u2018whiteness\u2019) and body practices (dieting, hair management, cleansing rituals, plastic surgery and genital cutting).   Over the sessions, we will take a conceptual approach to fashion, as a strident condition of modern life, that incorporates politics, science and aesthetics and we will closely read a number of cultural texts against a number of theoretical models. Attitudes towards the body can vary widely according to historical period, and this course will explore how, in different moments, and via different media, we have been preoccupied with the aesthetics of different body zones, with displaying identity (gender, class and ethnicity), and also with power. Different cultural forms (literary, visual, material etc) will provide the focus of our discussions as they all engage with the different ways that we make meaning out of our bodies. Students will be invited to investigate in their written work set texts from class in addition to primary material of their own choice.

This course will introduce students to the lifecycle of fashion, from forecasting fashion trends to the retailing and representation of vintage clothing, through design development, branding, buying and journalism. The course will also explore key issues for the sector \u2013 ethics, sustainability and the impact of the digital revolution. It will add a practical dimension to the NYU London triptych of fashion exploration, giving students unique access to studios and businesses working at the heart of London\u2019s vibrant fashion industry. Each session is structured to give students an overview of a particular stage in the fashion development process, through a mix of lectures from the course leader and visiting professionals, studio visits, walking tours, reading assignments and practical projects.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019?

The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

Application required.   This 2-credit course is designed to complement and enhance your 2-credit internship fieldwork placement completed during the same semester at NYU Sydney. The seminar provides the structure for you to explore many different aspects of your internship site, and to gain more from your experience by comparing and contrasting the internship experiences of all class participants. The goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of the company or organization hosting your internship, including its mission, approach, policies, and the context in which it operates. More generally, we will consider the state of the contemporary workplace and ourselves as workers. Throughout the semester we will take note of similarities and differences of Australian and American workplaces and work culture. Ultimately, you will use the seminar to reflect critically and analytically on the internship experience, and on your personal and future professional goals.

This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Topics in 20th Century German Literature: Traditions of City Writing - GERM-UA.9298, SOC-UA.9435                               This course addresses literary, cultural, and theoretical representations of Berlin and other big European cities such as Dresden and Paris. Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The course will first offer an overview of German theater traditions before 1900 and will then engage in analyzing specific developments in German theater starting with Max Reinhardt and his work at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Other case studies will focus on Brecht\u2019s epic theater, theater during the Third Reich, postwar theater trends in East and West Germany, and current developments in reunified Germany. Not only will we closely read relevant plays and theory by the theater makers of the respective periods but we will also explore aesthetics and performance issues as they have changed over time. As the involved practice of dramaturgy in Germany has greatly influenced theatrical developments, we will investigate this major aspect of theatrical work in Germany as a contribution to world theater and study how the extensive debate of ideas is being concretely realized in the theater through the choices being made in a production. An integral part of the course will include visits to Berlin theaters, attending performances, which we will analyze in class, and engaging in discussion with contemporary theater makers in Berlin.

Advanced Spanish skills (beyond Intermediate II) recommended.   This course combines a seminar based weekly section together with intensive internships in businesses, NGOs or other organizations. The experiential part will consist of 10 weekly hours of work within a pre-arranged organization. The academic part is meant to assist students in getting the most from this experience and provide theoretical and methodological elements to critically examine their experiences. It weaves together research design and methods with an empirical and theoretical examination of recent social phenomena in Argentina. We will use selected themes and topics to explore theoretical perspectives and selected aspects of contemporary Argentine society. In parallel we will explore how to construct a research project, collect data and analyze its contents.

Students come into close contact with the daily life of the site at which they are studying through a two-semester experiential learning sequence, which is designed to contextualize the site's culture and give students internship or internship-like experiences in the community. The fall Experiential Learning I course begins the immersion experience with a variety of community-based projects and an advanced introduction to the site's cultural and social identity. The spring Experiential Learning II includes a 2-credit on-site component that emphasizes internships (or the equivalent) and a 2-credit Junior Independent Research Seminar (for which students will register separately), in which students work online with a GLS faculty member and students with similar interests at different sites to craft an independent research project, an important preparation for the senior thesis.

To achieve the first two objectives, guest speakers will be invited to talk about specific topics, including the history, society and culture, religion, indigenous and contemporary health and political systems and their relevance in contemporary Ghana. These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

The overview investigates not only the country's experiments with authoritarianism - the experiences of mass murder, war and division - but also its emergence as a democratic leader, in the arts and human rights, and as Europe's power broker. We examine questions of citizenship and diversity, Germany's 'special' responsibility as a leader in Europe, the role of the Holocaust in State governance, Berlin's status and development as an industrial and cosmpolitan metropolis, and new avenues for German identity. We ask how these histories have made today's Berlin Europe's most exciting capital - a nexus of youth culture and the interational arts scene - and Germany a vanguard of the arts, sustainable energy, technical development and global politics.

Through an approach to local, cultural, and political issues the course will address how Argentina interacts with the region and the world, and how this international context impacts on Argentina. The emphasis will be on addressing a number of concepts that are necessary to understand Contemporary Argentina, politics in Buenos Aires and their relationship with the world. Spanish spoken in the Rio de la Plata region will be taught from a pragmatic approach, encouraging the learning and use of local expressions and Argentine Spanish, including political expressions used in the media, political activism and the everyday life of porte\u00f1os \u2013the inhabitants of Buenos Aires.

London                                                  Global Orientations: British Culture                               We often hear that Britain is a global country and London is a global city, but what does this mean? In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This workshop will help you to be able to engage in Spanish culture and language by means of an active, practical and lively learning experience. During Orientation week and over the course of the semester, you\u2019ll attend sessions with NYU Madrid professors, tour Madrid and surrounding cities, visit two of Madrid\u2019s most renowned art museums, take a weekend trip to a different part of Spain, and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to take part in interactive workshops (Spanish cooking, wine or dance). Finally, you\u2019ll read an article that will help you to reflect on your observations of and experiences in Madrid, and you\u2019ll write a brief paper incorporating your conclusions. All in all, Global Orientations seeks to help you make the most of your experience in Madrid so that you leave knowing where you\u2019ve been and how the experience may have affected you as a person.                          Paris                                                    Global Orientations: Reflections on Modern France - GLBL-UA 9107                               This course aims to explore the place that Paris \u2013 and more broadly France -- hold in the public imaginary, while examining the tensions and antagonisms that rightfully complicate that view. Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.                              Prague                                                    Global Orientations: The Czech Republic in a Global Context                               The purpose of this class is primarily to discuss the history and culture of the Czech Republic and Central Europe\u2014the intersection of many international influences--in the context of globalization and, conversely, to discuss globalization in the local context. An important dimension of the class will be a discussion about how international students should use their experience abroad (in this case Prague and, more generally, Central Europe) to better understand complicated developments on the global level and back at home.   Taught by Dr. Jiri Pehe with a team of NYU Prague professors                            Shanghai                                                    Global Orientations: Introduction to Contemporary China                               This program is being offered to familiarize all students, irrespoective of college or concentration, with a range of issues that inform understandng of life in contemporary China. Students will engage in experiential learning activities, learn about issues pertinent to Chinese society and history, and interact with experts in various fields of Chinese studies.                            Sydney                                                    Global Orientations: Australian Society and Culture                               Australian society is replete with contradictions. Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Global Orientations: Israeli Society and Culture                               This course is designed to help you understand contemporary Israel \u2013 the society, its problems and its pre-occupations. Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.

Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC. Students will consider the current state of affairs and be challenged to imagine how the future might be different. Respectful, factual, passionate and influential dialogue will be encouraged and expected.

It will focus on the how environmental health issues are defined and approached by civic groups, governmental officials and researchers. It will highlight how environmental threats come to the attention of the public and weigh the options for addressing these threats. Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.

Students explore the ways social, economic, and political forces influence the health of populations. Additionally, this course will focus upon some of the current ethical public health dilemmas where the rights of the individual versus the rights of society come into conflict. The course makes use of diverse methods of instruction, including, but not limited to, small group discussion, group exercises, mini-lectures, student debates, field-based group projects and student presentations. Students may be involved in gathering information and observations from projects outside of the classroom at government, NGO and health care institutions.

It is intimately related to public health and policy making, as it provides elemental \u201cinformation for action\u201d. This course is designed to introduce students to the history, basic principles and methods of epidemiology.     Topics covered in this course are history, background and different perspectives of epidemiology, measures of disease frequency; measures of association; epidemiologic study designs; public health surveillance; outbreak investigations; assessment of causality; and relationship between epidemiology and public health policies. In addition, students are expected to develop skills to critically read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiological studies and mass media sources.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.                                                                      Tango and Mass Culture - SASEM-UG 9150\u00a0or SPAN-UA 9TBA - 4 points                               This course, previously taught in Spanish, will be taught in English during the Fall 2015 semester.   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.

It has caught up with Israeli literature, scoring awards and world-wide recognition not only for its artistic achievements but also for its gutsy in-depth engagement with political, social, and sex-and-gender borders and boundaries that are local and universal at one and the same time. The course will explore some of these issues as they are tackled in contemporary cinema and fiction. Classes will be organized in three thematic clusters:     \u201cFamily, I Love and Hate You\u201d   \u201cThe Political is Personal Too\u201d: War, Terror, Self-sacrifice   Crossing the Lines: Trauma, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity       (This grouping is determined by what seems to be a work\u2019s major theme, though most of works studied, and certainly the best among them, are bi- or multi-focal, crossing several boundaries of universal divisions.)   When appropriate, students will be asked to prepare relevant backgrounds materials \u2013 socio- historical studies, reviews, etc.                                                                      Ancient Israel: History and Archaeology - Travelers, Collectors and Antiquities Robbers -\u00a0HBRJD-UA\u00a09118 or HIST-UA 9524 or SASEM-UG 9550 - 4 points                               The story of the archaeological discipline in the Land of Israel is strongly tied with the major developments that the region has undergone in the last two centuries. This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.

The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.

The course begins with a discussion of the nature of West African society before the introduction of the Atlantic Slave Trade; and the relations among Asante peoples, other neighboring West African peoples, the indigenous slave trade, and relations with Europeans in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The Atlantic Slave trade itself is analyzed from historical, ethnographic, sociological, economic and political perspectives, focusing on Africa, Europe and the Americas. The immediate and long term effects of the Slave Trade on Africa are considered, as well as the history of the trade's Abolition, and the legacy of the Atlantic Slave trade in African, European and American societies.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

On both sides of the Atlantic, the concept of multiculturalism and the question of irregular migration present thorny issues for academics and policy makers alike. This course will provide a comparative (US/Europe) introduction to the history of migration, from the late 1880\u00b4s to the present day, in order to help students develop a basic historical framework that will allow them to more deeply understand contemporary migration policy and debates surrounding immigrant integration. The experiences of a number of European countries will be looked at in depth: the UK, France, Italy, and Germany. We will begin by looking at mass Italian migration to the US in the late 19th and early Twentieth Centuries, discussing how the first waves of Italian migrants were racialized and how they were inserted into the existing racial order in the US. We will learn about the Fascist Period in Italy, and in particular, its Racial Laws and the specificities of the Holocaust in Italy during World War II and how this period has influenced the way that continental European countries collect and organize census data. Moving into the contemporary period, we will explore how Italy has transformed itself from a historic emigrant-sending country into one of Europe\u00b4s leading immigrant-receiving nations and how it has managed migration to date; discuss the myths and reality of the hotly debated issue of undocumented migration; learn about how migration policy is always gendered and impacts differently upon men and women; gain insight into the highly stigmatized Roma communities in Europe, and study multiculturalism and citizenship policy in Europe and the US through a range of case studies, such as the Muslim headscarf debate. There will be a strong focus on &quot;on-site&quot; learning in this course, with field trips to a Sikh temple in the province of Tuscany, the Jewish museum in Florence, the Chinese quarter of Prato, as well as site visits to associations that work with immigrants and refugees.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The French Revolution &amp; Napoleon - HIST-UA 9143 - 4 points                               Lift your eyes as you walk down any street in Paris and you'll soon see a building adorned with the tricolore and the words Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9. Turn a corner and in the distance you'll see the Arc de Triomphe built to the glory of Napoleon's army or the Eiffel tower erected for the centennial of the fall of the Bastille. Even the metro stops, Concorde, Nation, R\u00e9publique, Austerlitz, I\u00e9na, echo with the memory of the years of the French Revolution and the First Empire.  But what historic reality does all this evoke? What led some French people to overthrow their age old Monarchy, turn their backs on the Church and launch into a new era of Republican government? What caused others to resist such changes with all their might? And why did the experiment end within 10 years, giving way to military dictatorship and an Empire which spread French rule across Europe.  This semester we shall explore these issues and others pertaining to the Age of the French Revolution &amp; Napoleon through lectures, readings, discussions and site visits in and around the city of Paris.

Sample syllabus                                                                    History of Nationalism in Central and Eastern Europe -\u00a0HIST-UA 9176 - 4 points                               In the 20th Century, three phenomena had fateful consequences for Central and Eastern Europe: (1) the unsuccessful attempt to eliminate, after WWI, national tension by creating new nation-states, and the encounters with both major totalitarian ideologies, (2) Nazism and (3) Communism. The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Though its waters connect places as diverse as Patagonia, Kamchatka, Hawai\u2019I, Tokyo, Shanghai, and Sydney, histories of these disparate regions and their societies can profitably be considered under a common rubric. This course brings together work across disciplines, from history, anthropology, geography, political economy, and cultural studies, to piece together the contours of the Pacific Ocean, c. 1500 to c. 1850, as a historical arena of internal linkages as well as one forged by connections with the wider world. Central themes of the course will include cultural encounters, comparative empires, trade, and environmental change.

This course offers an overview of the history of archaeology in Palestine since the appearance of the first European travelers and missionaries in the mid-19th century, along the vibrant interest of collectors, forgers and robbers in the Promised Land, through the appearance of the first scientific excavations, the rise of the American biblical archaeology and its influence on local Israeli research.   Special attention will be given to the way the newly born Israeli archaeology helped to establish the Zionist identity that wished to pass over two thousand years of Diaspora history; the methods by which the nascent Israeli archaeology connected new-comers to the land of the patriarchs and the manner by which Israeli scholars served state interests in the creation of the national Zionist ethos.   The aftermath of the Six Days War and the increasing tension between the Bible and archaeology will be discussed in light of the intense debate over the historicity of the Exodus story, Joshua's conquests and the United Kingdom of David and Solomon. Finally, at the turn of the millennium, post-modern archaeology presented a new pluralistic view of the past. This multi-vocal framework will be used as a background for discussing the archaeology of otherness and minorities in 21st century Israel.

The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.

American Constitution - POL-UA 9330 or HIST-UA 9330 - 4 points                               This course will examine everything in the American Constitution except for its guarantee of individual rights, such as those enumerated in the Bill of Rights. In studying the governmental powers created and limited by the American Constitution, the course will be broken into three parts, with each section covering one of the three branches of the American political system \u2013 the judicial, legislative, and executive branches. The course will reveal the particular ways our understanding of each branch\u2019s powers have constituted, and been constituted by, American practices of constitutional democracy. Our studies will also have a philosophical component, in exploring the fundamental nature of law and what it means for law to bind political actors. In addition, the course will have a distinctly legal dimension, drawing from Supreme Court opinions to illuminate how constitutional controversies are adjudicated. Through the course, therefore, students will come to see the political, philosophical, and legal features of American constitutional law, and the deep connections between among these components.

Students should also be prepared to pay up to \u00a3100 or $150 for extra tickets while in London as part of the Methods &amp; Practice course.     Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. Spin is the Washington art of taking something and making it seem truth-y even when it\u2019s not quite factual. This is a user\u2019s guide for reporters and non-journalists alike. How to spot and dodge the misleading, the incomplete truth, along with the history and reasoning behind manipulation of facts. Advice from those who practice spin and those who successfully avoid it and what it\u2019s like to be stuck as a victim of spin. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, the White House Office of Science Technology and Policy, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course and how it is all spun.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

We will consider how to compare American and Chinese governance systems, and whether and how concepts can be translated between them\u2014so that the countries, and their citizens can learn from, and cooperate with, one another. In the process, we hope to learn about China, but also to reflect\u2014in the light of 9/11 and Iraq-- more deeply on our own understanding of how American governance works\u2014and how it is seen by the world.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world. Conducted in English.

The first opens with an analysis of the intellectual foundations of the witch-hunt from late Antiquity to the early Renaissance. The second section concentrates on the most infamous handbook for witch-hunters, Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of the Witches\u201d) and on the roots of medieval misogyny. The third section looks at the mass witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the backdrop of the break between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and examines the connections linking witch-hunting to the momentous social, political and religious changes of the times. In the fourth part, the course will shift focus to the grassroots level, shedding light on the economic and social mechanisms which lead a community to \u201cmake a witch\u201d.

The interpretative classes will run concurrently with production management, sights and sound, and post-production workshops. The course will have three objectives: (1) teach students the documentary tradition from Flaherty to Rouch; (2) use critical Cinema theory to define a document with a camera; and (3) create a short documentary film.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

It focuses on the way that different social groups (according to  class, milieu, origin, gender or sexuality) appropriate urban space and constitute  place-specific identities.  It uses the city of Berlin with its multiple layers of history as a laboratory for  contemporary urban research with historical, empirical and theoretical material. We will  study key debates on urban developments, partly as field visits, in regard to housing,  migration, gentrification, and we will search for the creative and the sustainable city.  You will be introduced to the contemporary discourses on those trends and to new  ways of reading and seeing a city.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Argentine Civil Society. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency. The course provides you with tools to analyze your organization\u2019s approach, its policies, its programs, and the political, legal, social, economic and cultural contexts in which it operates. Guest-speakers are invited to the seminar and case studies on Argentina civil society are discussed.&amp;nbsp; You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

It is designed to provide the student with practical and theoretical tools to understand and critically analyze European cities. We will take a close look at the social, political and urban challenges these cities are currently facing.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers. Conducted in French.      Sample Syllabus                            Shanghai                                                  Global Connections: Shanghai - SCA-SHU 9634 - 4 points                               The main aim of this course is to facilitate a rich engagement with Shanghai. The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.     Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.

The course aims to introduce the fundamental historical trajectories of the conflict, and to present and analyze the conflicting narratives and perceptions of both Palestinians and Israelis over key moments and issues in its history. By so doing, we will pay specific attention to the respective histories of the conflict, as well as to the challenges that each side is encountering over the future of the conflict and possible solutions to it. Among other issues, the course focuses on key moments in the history of Palestine during the British mandate; the conflicting narratives over the 1948 war; Israel and the Palestinians between 1948-1967; the 1967 war and its implications on Israel and the Palestinians; the development of the Palestinian national movement; the first and second Intifadas and the challenges to the Oslo peace process. The course will address these issues through a variety of readings, primary sources and films. As a conclusion, the students will present their own reflections and analyses of various aspects of the history of the conflict and debate its future implications.

Beginning with the epistemological and metaphysical debates that followed the rediscovery of Ancient philosophy and the Copernican revolution in the sciences, we will consider Montaigne\u2019s skepticism, Descartes\u2019 attempts at securing our knowledge of the soul, God, and the external world, and Condillac\u2019s empiricist critique of Descartes\u2019 theory of knowledge. We will then focus on major developments in French political philosophy in the 18th and 19th centuries, closely intertwined with political events in France at the time, including such figures as Rousseau, Proudhon, and Tocqueville. Finally, we will look at two of the major movements in French philosophy in the first half of the 20th century: Henri Bergson\u2019s attempts to understand the temporal duration conscious beings inhabit, and Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir\u2019s distinctive development of existentialism, a philosophy that grapples with the radical consequences of human freedom.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Directed Projects: Experimental Photography: Innovation in History and Practice ( Lecture and Lab) - IPHTI-UT 1000 - 4 points                                Prerequisite: Photo I or equivalent. An analog or a digital camera with manual settings is required. Students registering for this course must also register for Directed Projects Lab (0 points).   NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Student should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   Florence can be considered the historic capital of optics: as the leading center for the production of lenses and spectacles in the Renaissance, it was also a center for extraordinary experimentation regarding the science of vision. The experiments and writings of such masters as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Giovan Battista della Porta and Galileo, among others, are testimony to the extraordinary contributions made here to the understanding of sight and to the development of devices that aided, altered or controlled vision for artistic purpose.   This course proposes to contextualize historic photographic techniques within this rich context of the history of optics. An invaluable resource for this exploration will be the Acton Photograph Archive at Villa La Pietra with its rich collection of stereographs, daguerrotypes, ambrotypes, silver prints and albumen prints. Students will thus be able to learn about these historic techniques by examining firsthand surviving, in some cases extremely rare, examples of them.   Following the inspiration of these historic techniques, from the experiments of the Florentine Renaissance artists to those of the Alinari Brothers, a firm founded in Florence in the nineteenth century and renowned throughout the world as an early innovator in the uses and techniques of photography, students will have the opportunity to explore these techniques themselves hands on. They will be encouraged to develop their individual expression through their own projects employing one or more of these historic photographic techniques. This inspiring course on experimental photography explores new possibilities of imagemaking by combining pinhole and toy cameras and other alternative techniques with a theoretical approach to representation.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

Our exploration of political theory will proceed from a  close reading and analysis of seminal texts that are presented both conceptually and,  for the most part, chronologically. The primary focus will be placed on examining the  historical antecedents of some of the foundational concepts and practices that  distinguish our political behavior and institutions today. While taking account of the  historical complexities and stylized conventions of each text, the course will highlight  the recurrent themes that animate these influential writings and continue to shape our  contemporary understanding of politics. In particular, the lectures and discussions will  be geared towards tracing the conceptual underpinnings of current forms of political  organization, such as the nation-state and liberal democracy, and their effects on the  concerns of law, justice and morality. Some of the critical issues to be discussed  include the divergent views of human nature and ideal society, the structure of  authority and sovereignty, states of emergency, the defense of liberty, equality and  justice, and the different models of democratic practice.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Their versions, indeed, serve as the basis for the French Revolution of 1789. A long and difficult process, democracy needed nearly a century before establishing itself in France. Drawing on numerous examples from 19th and 20th century history, we will try to understand why the great contributions of democracy, such as universal suffrage and the concept of individual liberty, were so difficult to put into operation. We will also consider why these &quot;givens&quot; are still fragile. Conducted in French.

We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.

Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.

Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.

Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.

The first part examines competing approaches to international politics, explains their basic concepts and rationales, and evaluates their explanatory insights. The principal objective of this part is for students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which various theoretical perspectives lead to different understandings of the structures and practices of world politics. The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.

In studying the governmental powers created and limited by the American Constitution, the course will be broken into three parts, with each section covering one of the three branches of the American political system \u2013 the judicial, legislative, and executive branches. The course will reveal the particular ways our understanding of each branch\u2019s powers have constituted, and been constituted by, American practices of constitutional democracy. Our studies will also have a philosophical component, in exploring the fundamental nature of law and what it means for law to bind political actors. In addition, the course will have a distinctly legal dimension, drawing from Supreme Court opinions to illuminate how constitutional controversies are adjudicated. Through the course, therefore, students will come to see the political, philosophical, and legal features of American constitutional law, and the deep connections between among these components.

This is true not only for Arab governments, but for decision-makers and analysts in the West.   The goal of this course will be to examine the role public opinion is playing in shaping on-going developments in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the relationships between several Arab states and Iran and Turkey, and efforts to achieve a resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.     We will explore the use of up-to-date polling in all these countries to better understand how Arabs: see themselves, view their governments, prioritize their political concerns, and get and use information. We will also examine the misconceptions about Arabs that have long shaped policies that the West has adopted toward the Arab World - leading to the deep divide that defines our current relationship with that region.

The format of the course will be multi-dimensional including lectures, discussions, interactive  activities, documentary films, television commercials, insider campaign video, and other  media sources. The instructor will use a keynote presentation format to review the material  and present video clips and commercials to lead and inform class discussions.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

The first opens with an analysis of the intellectual foundations of the witch-hunt from late Antiquity to the early Renaissance. The second section concentrates on the most infamous handbook for witch-hunters, Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of the Witches\u201d) and on the roots of medieval misogyny. The third section looks at the mass witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the backdrop of the break between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and examines the connections linking witch-hunting to the momentous social, political and religious changes of the times. In the fourth part, the course will shift focus to the grassroots level, shedding light on the economic and social mechanisms which lead a community to \u201cmake a witch\u201d.

Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.

It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

The course will focus on the current realities and future possibilities of global higher education at the backdrop of its historical and conceptual coordinates. A glance at the con-temporary higher education landscape reveals ambivalent trends and directions: Excellence and internationalization protrude as paradigms that drive universities to secure their stakes in the global higher education market. National politics of education further enhance this competition among institutional front-runners by launching excellence initiatives or entering in supranational Bologna-type arrangements to facilitate cross-border academic exchange and knowledge production. Hence a range of distinct regional approaches to global education have emerged from national models and practices of education.    This course will serve as a site of academic dialogue between NYU and HU students in one classroom by pursuing the following three steps. First, it seeks to familiarize its participants with the visions and promises of global education while also paying attention to potential perils involved in globalizing national models of education. Among others, we will address questions such as: How are modes of producing and disseminating knowledge affected when education crosses borders? What does global education demand from student learners and how are globally educated citizens envisioned? How can experiences of knowledge production and education specific to one context be made operable in another? In a second step, the course introduces and compares regional approaches to global education. Different national histories of higher education yield different answers to the questions formulated in the first step. Yet, debates center around (one) global education, not educations. This tension requires scrutiny and, in a third step, it will ask students to develop an informed and critical position on the stakes of global education.  In order to make use of the unique classroom setting the course will employ independent (out-of-class) and in-class, individual and collective, analytical and interpretive formats. Students will be particularly encouraged to fully embrace the learning impulses resulting from the inter-cultural encounter between NYU and Humboldt students. The language we are going to acquire in this course is called global education. By starting to learn its rules and formulas, students are likely to see possible future trajectories of educational development and might even envision their future role in it. The class work will culminate in a colloquium at which both NYU and HU students will present their final group projects.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.

The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century. Previous knowledge of art history, architecture, or German history is not required, but useful.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

By studying social networks -- i.e., the web of relationships in which individuals and groups are embedded --, we will understand important collective dynamics, such as interpersonal influence, social diffusion, the origin of social norms, group cohesion and inter-group conflict, political participation, and market exchange. This course will offer an overview of basic social networks concepts, combining the theoretical tradition of structural and relational sociology with the analytical tools of graph theory.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

It is designed to provide the student with practical and theoretical tools to understand and critically analyze European cities. We will take a close look at the social, political and urban challenges these cities are currently facing.                                                                      Comparative U.S. and European Human Rights - POL-UA 9994 or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course is a study of comparative human rights between European countries, including  Spain, and the United States of America. International human rights legislation imposes  the same obligations on all signatory countries. Despite this, however, interpretation and  application of these rights vary considerably between countries. Students will explore a set  of controversial issues in order to understand the complex differences between the United  States and European countries\u2019 interpretation of human rights obligations, and will also look  at how these differences are portrayed in society by comparing international and national  media coverage of the issues.

Each dreams of one day becoming a \u201cgreen\u201d city. Danger also exists in both of these cities, amplified by rumor and fantasy. In this course we will study these phenomena through the analysis of novels, films, television series, artwork, and architecture, to ask how various representations of the city have changed and been managed over time, by diverse social actors and observers. Conducted in French.

We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.

The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n.

This course deals with themes of culture, cultural identity and the politics of culture and identity, with reference to five specific Latin American cases: a). Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Queer Cultures and Democracy - SPAN-UA 9481 or SCA-UA 9844 - 4 points                               In the last ten years, several Latin American nations have witnessed decisive progress in the legal recognition of non-normative sexualities and gender identities. Argentina passed the same-sex marriage law in 2010 and the gender identity law in 2011, followed by Uruguay; Colombia approved the legal recognition of same sex couples, and in Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, the pressure of queer demands and visibility in the public sphere is stronger than ever. The conventional map of \u201cadvanced democracies\u201d crafting models of democratization that could be exported to less developed nations seems definitely challenged: a new understanding of the complex, and multiple temporalities of queer cultures in North and South America is more necessary than ever.    In order to explore this rich and multi-layered landscape, this course wants to trace and reconstruct the historical detours of queer cultures in Buenos Aires and New York. Taking as starting point the present context of growing acceptance and inclusion of queer citizens both in Latin America and the US, the course revisits the last three decades in order to question the dominant and frequently reductive narratives of steady, lineal progress. Our goal is precisely to advance a periodization sensitive to the nuances and contradictions of this complex historical transformation.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Islam and Spain: Past and Present - MEIS-UA 9707 or SPAN-UA 9333 - 4 points                               Prerequisite of SPAN-UA 100 or to be taken concurrently with SPAN-UA 9100.   From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.     Note: This Class does NOT currently include a trip to Morocco as in past semesters.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Culture of Spain: An Anthropological Perspective - SPAN-UA 9631 or ANTH-UA 9250 - 4 points                               The recent changes in both Spain and Portugal are only the latest in a series of important transformations which these two countries have undergone over the past fifty years or so. In that time, they have both gone from being predominantly rural societies where the majority of the population live and work on the land to become industrial societies not unlike those of northern Europe and North America. Yet the underlying cultural heterogeneity of the peoples of the Iberian Peninsula has meant that different regions have often had very distinct reactions to the various pressures towards political, economic and social change.   As well as introducing you to some of the basic concepts used in the study of social change, this course concentrates on examining the ethnographic diversity of the various regions of Spain and Portugal. Knowledge of this underlying diversity is essential in comprehending the importance that regionalism has played in Iberian history and its relevance to the understanding of the acceptance or rejection of such change by the different regions in contemporary Spain and Portugal. The course will specifically examine the rapidly changing role of women in both countries.
