Of the essay as a major genre,      critical attention as well as popular reading habit      gravitate toward the belle lettres , which took      roots in New Literature by means of a productive though      unmediated borrowing from both the Chinese classical      gentry-literati tradition and the traditions of the      modern European and Japanese essayistic practice from      Montaigne to Tanizaki, with the Anglo-American essayists      standing at the very center). This symposium, which      brings together graduate students and faculty from      Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Peking      University and the Departments of East Asian Studies and      of Comparative Literature at New York University into an      intimate and sustained dialogue, seeks to give the      modern Chinese essayistic tradition a critical attention      and scrutiny where it is due, by revisiting the literary      production of its central figures, namely the Zhou      Brothers--Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren; by reexamining the      stylistic and aesthetic properties of the essay as such;      and by probing into the ontological-political space of      the essay as it was opened up and institutionalized in      the middle of intense socio- and cultural political      battles of modern China, which, historically and in the      most personal manner, constituted the very the force      field in which the essay thrived.        The      student papers to be presented at this symposium are      work-in-progress in every sense. The PKU papers are      drawn from three graduate seminars on the essay offered      in the Chinese Department in the single semester of Fall      2010, which testified to the growing importance of this      subfield. The instructors of those seminars were      Professor Wang Feng of PKU; Professor Huang Ziping of      Hong Kong Baptist University (emeritus) and Professor      Xudong Zhang of New York University and Chang-Jiang      Chair Visiting Professor of PKU. The NYU papers have      been organized as a series of responses to the PKU paper      but with their own research and methodological focus,      resulting from NYU graduate students long-term interest      in questions regarding Chinese literary modernity and      cultural politics; comparative and interdisciplinary      approach to literary analysis; and in translation      theory. As an event in the long list of activities      generated by the NYU-PKU exchange and cooperation      program, which recently led to the formal launching of      the International Center for Critical Theory, PKU-NYU,      the symposium is meant to be not a conclusion but rather      a new point of departure for successive efforts at      cracking the nut of the modern Chinese essay as an      object of historical, aesthetic, and political analysis,      which has been unfolding in the form of numerous reading      groups, graduate seminars, workshops, and research      conferences taking place at PKU, East China Normal      University in Shanghai, University of Tokyo's Center of      Philosophy (UTCP) since the winter of 2006. From the      perspective of programmatic and curricular development,      however, It is no exaggeration to say that \"Lu Xun and      the Politics of Chinese Modern Essay\" has been one of      the nodal points on which different institutional and      critical sources of energy converged and, eventually,      gave rise to initial frames and shapes of International      Center for Critical Theory.

Of the essay as a major genre,      critical attention as well as popular reading habit      gravitate toward the belle lettres , which took      roots in New Literature by means of a productive though      unmediated borrowing from both the Chinese classical      gentry-literati tradition and the traditions of the      modern European and Japanese essayistic practice from      Montaigne to Tanizaki, with the Anglo-American essayists      standing at the very center). This symposium, which      brings together graduate students and faculty from      Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Peking      University and the Departments of East Asian Studies and      of Comparative Literature at New York University into an      intimate and sustained dialogue, seeks to give the      modern Chinese essayistic tradition a critical attention      and scrutiny where it is due, by revisiting the literary      production of its central figures, namely the Zhou      Brothers--Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren; by reexamining the      stylistic and aesthetic properties of the essay as such;      and by probing into the ontological-political space of      the essay as it was opened up and institutionalized in      the middle of intense socio- and cultural political      battles of modern China, which, historically and in the      most personal manner, constituted the very the force      field in which the essay thrived.        The      student papers to be presented at this symposium are      work-in-progress in every sense. The PKU papers are      drawn from three graduate seminars on the essay offered      in the Chinese Department in the single semester of Fall      2010, which testified to the growing importance of this      subfield. The instructors of those seminars were      Professor Wang Feng of PKU; Professor Huang Ziping of      Hong Kong Baptist University (emeritus) and Professor      Xudong Zhang of New York University and Chang-Jiang      Chair Visiting Professor of PKU. The NYU papers have      been organized as a series of responses to the PKU paper      but with their own research and methodological focus,      resulting from NYU graduate students long-term interest      in questions regarding Chinese literary modernity and      cultural politics; comparative and interdisciplinary      approach to literary analysis; and in translation      theory. As an event in the long list of activities      generated by the NYU-PKU exchange and cooperation      program, which recently led to the formal launching of      the International Center for Critical Theory, PKU-NYU,      the symposium is meant to be not a conclusion but rather      a new point of departure for successive efforts at      cracking the nut of the modern Chinese essay as an      object of historical, aesthetic, and political analysis,      which has been unfolding in the form of numerous reading      groups, graduate seminars, workshops, and research      conferences taking place at PKU, East China Normal      University in Shanghai, University of Tokyo's Center of      Philosophy (UTCP) since the winter of 2006. From the      perspective of programmatic and curricular development,      however, It is no exaggeration to say that \"Lu Xun and      the Politics of Chinese Modern Essay\" has been one of      the nodal points on which different institutional and      critical sources of energy converged and, eventually,      gave rise to initial frames and shapes of International      Center for Critical Theory.
