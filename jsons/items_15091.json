In 1993, he became a full-time professor and now holds the position as Associate Clinical Professor of Law in Business. With over twenty-five years of experience in the practice of law, he brings to the classroom practical firsthand knowledge and an intimate understanding of the intricacies of the legal system in relation to society and the world of business. With sections at the undergraduate level as well as in the Full-Time MBA Program, the Langone Part-Time MBA Program, and the Executive MBA program, his courses have addressed legal aspects of business, entertainment, and entrepreneurial concerns. Currently, he teaches Business Law for Managers as well as his self-developed courses, Entertainment Law, Entrepreneurship & Law in Practice, Law through the Lens of Film, and Law for the Executive.         During his time as an educator at Stern, Professor Hendler has received several accolades, including the Executive MBA Excellence in Teaching Award and the Undergraduate Teacher of the Year Honors in both 2001 and 2003. He received the Citibank Award for Excellence in Teaching as well as University Recognition for outstanding dedication and devotion to New York University and its students. As well, he was honored with the Eli Kushel Excellence in Teaching Award (1995), the Arthur Andersen LLP Foundation\u2019s Outstanding Faculty Advisor Award (2000), and the Teacher of the Year Award (1998). In 2014, he received the Stern Distinguished Teaching Award for Excellence in Teaching. He has served on the MBA\u2019s Judiciary Committee and acts as an advisor for students of NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study and as a faculty advisor for fraternities, sororities, and clubs and is now in his third year as a Faculty Fellow in Residence at Palladium Residence Hall.        In addition to his academic work, Professor Hendler is engaged in private practice in New York, handling a broad scope of business-related legal matters. At NYU School of Law, he acts as a supervising attorney for law students in the Media Law Collaborative, and he is affiliated with the Berkley Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation as its Legal-Expert-in-Residence. He often speaks at seminars and private industry trading centers about ethical and legal issues confronting the business community and lectures for leading Bar and CPA Exam Review courses.        Prior to establishing his own law practice and pursuing teaching, he practiced law with Hughes, Hubbard & Reed and Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, two of the largest law firms in the United States. Professor Hendler received his Juris Doctor degree from the NYU School of Law and graduated magna cum laude from the NYU College of Business and Public Administration (now known as the Stern School of Business).
