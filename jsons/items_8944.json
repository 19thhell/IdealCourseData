Placantonakis, MD, PhD     Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is the most common brain malignancy in the brain with 10,000 new cases in the US every year. Despite treatment with surgery and chemoradiotherapy, median survival is only 14.6 months, making GBM a devastating and incurable disease. Within GBM, a cellular hierarchy is defined by stem-like cells (glioblastoma stem cells or GSCs), which possess self-renewal and multipotency properties, as well as the ability to generate tumors in animal models. More importantly, due to their intrinsic resistance against chemoradiotherapy, GSCs are believed to be the reason for tumor recurrence, suggesting that their eradication is critical in the development of novel treatments for GBM.\u00a0 Previous work has shown that CD133, a pentaspan transmembrane glycoprotein, is specifically expressed on GSCs in GBM and, therefore, represents a potential therapeutic target.     Toward testing the hypothesis that eradication of CD133+ GSCs can provide a treatment and potentially a cure for GBM, we explored lentiviral gene therapy specifically targeting CD133+ cells as a novel strategy. More specifically, we tested whether a non-replicating lentiviral vector (CD133Lenti), which presents an antibody against an extracellular epitope of CD133, specifically transduced CD133+ GSCs. Using primary human GBM cultures obtained from operative specimens resected at NYU, we found that CD133+ GSCs represented 1-4% of all cells in our cultures. When we incubated dissociated GBM cells with CD133Lenti expressing a blue fluorescent protein (TagBFP) for easy identification of transduced cells, we found that the virus transduced cells in a dose-dependent manner. This finding was consistent with our hypothesis that CD133Lenti transduced CD133+ GBM cells.     Since then, the Placantonakis laboratory has shown that CD133Lenti selectively transduces CD133+ GBM stem cells in vitro and in vivo via an interaction between the antibody on the viral envelope and CD133 on the cell surface of GBM cells. The laboratory is currently testing whether CD133Lenti expressing the lethal gene encoding Pseudomonas exotoxin ablates CD133+ GSCs in human GBM tumors grown in the mouse brain and reduces tumor volume.     We propose that our findings may have therapeutic implications for GBM, as well as other brain and systemic malignancies with stem cells expressing CD133.     Supported by the ABTA.
