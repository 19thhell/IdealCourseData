Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the Satisfactory Academic Progress standard defined here, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS   To be considered for financial aid each year, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their degree requirements. Students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of 76 percent of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   ADVANCED PLACEMENT, ADVANCED STANDING AND TRANSFER STUDENTS   Accepted credit points from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status are considered to be attempted and completed credits for the purpose of evaluating satisfactory academic progress.   HEOP AND CSTEP   Undergraduate students participating in the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or the New York State Collegiate Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   PAUL MCGHEE DIVISION   SCPS Paul McGhee Division students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status)in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   GRADUATE STUDENTS   Graduate students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P) in a minimum of 80 percent (67 percent for GSAS students, 75 percent for law students) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters).   Most graduate schools at the University require a minimum GPA of 3.0. This may vary, so you should consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic requirements published in your school's bulletin. Normal progress requires completing all courses for which you are registered and progressing toward your degree at a level that compares favorably with other registrants working toward the same degree in the same academic program.              * * * * * * *   Extending Your Financial Aid     Financial aid funding (federal, state, and campus-based) is designed to help students complete their degree requirements within a limited period of time and is generally not available beyond that point. However, in certain circumstances the Office of Financial Aid may authorize additional student funding for one or more semesters. To be considered for an extension of financial aid availability please submit an Aid Eligibility Extension Request Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .              * * * * * * *   Review of Your Academic Progress   Federal regulations require New York University to monitor the academic performance of its students for the purpose of verifying and maintaining their eligibility for federal financial aid. If you do not meet the standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), your federal financial aid will be suspended. In most cases, state and NYU financial aid (scholarship) require that the same criteria be maintained for continued eligibility. Some graduate schools have different eligibility criteria for their scholarships and students are encouraged to review their school/department criteria accordingly.     NYU does not offer ESL or remedial courses for credit towards any of its undergraduate or graduate degrees.   Most types of financial aid - including federal financial aid - require students be enrolled in courses that are necessary to fulfill their degree requirements; therefore, students enrolling in an excessive number of electives that are not applicable to their degree may have their financial aid revoked. To ensure applicable courses are taken, students are encouraged to seek out guidance from their academic advisors.     For students who change schools or change majors within NYU, all credits that count towards their degree in their new school or towards their new major are considered both attempted credits and earned credits. Credits that are not applied towards the degree in the student\u2019s new school or towards their new major count neither as attempted credits nor as earned credits.   All repeated courses count as both attempted and earned credits and all types of incompletes count as attempted credits but not as earned credits.     An academic progress calculator is available here as a guide to your status.   The Office of Financial Aid typically conducts a SAP review at least annually at the conclusion of each academic year, and students who do not meet the requirement receive a notice on their NYU Albert account.   FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION   Students who do not meet the SAP requirement are automatically placed on financial aid suspension (unless the student is approved for financial aid probation, see below). During suspension, the student will not be eligible for financial aid. (Students may continue to acquire private non-NYU scholarships and private non-federal loans.) Eligibility for financial aid will be returned when the student meets the SAP standard.   FINANCIAL AID PROBATION   All students have the right to appeal the suspension of their financial aid. Students may appeal only once for each academic degree in most circumstances (an exception may be granted in the event of illness or injury).   You may avoid financial aid suspension by asking to be placed on financial aid probation, which requires the submission of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .   Students who are approved will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester. The student will remain eligible for financial aid and will continue to receive financial assistance during the approved probationary semester.   Students who meet the SAP standard at the end of their probationary semester will be restored to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. Students who do not meet the SAP requirements at the end of the probationary period will be placed on financial aid suspension (described above).   Students are permitted only one semester of financial aid probation. If a student meets the SAP requirement at the end of their probationary semester but later fails again to meet the SAP requirement, the student is not eligible for additional financial aid probation, except in the event of illness or injury.   NOTICE: The current SAP standard for traditional undergraduate students is effective beginning summer semester 2011. Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the current SAP standard, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     ********************************************************************             Enrollment Status   To be considered for any type of student aid you must be officially admitted to New York University or matriculated in a degree program, and be making satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements. Students in certain certificate or diploma programs may also be eligible for consideration. Generally, University-administered aid is awarded only to full-time students.   Part-Time Status :Part-time students (fewer than 12 points per semester) may be eligible for a Federal Direct Loan or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, but they must also maintain satisfactory academic progress. Undergraduate students may also be eligible for Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) (New York State residents only \u2014 separate application available here ) or for Pell Grants.     Half-Time/Full-Time Equivalency :Graduate students may be eligible for a half-time or full-time equivalency, based upon the determination of their academic department,even if they are not enrolled for actual credits. Limited financial aid may be available to students with posted equivalencies. Cost of attendance for students with equivalencies is based upon living and miscellaneous expenses and not tuition and fees.       Deferred Enrollment   Freshmen applicants who have been offered admission to NYU may submit a request to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to defer their enrollment for up to one year. Students approved for deferral who received a financial aid package with their original offer of admission can expect that the NYU portion of their package (University scholarships and grants) will also be deferred and received in full as originally offered. It is not necessary to resubmit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, and scholarship eligibility will not be reevaluated. Deferred students must, however, reapply for any federal or state funds that were awarded as part of the original package by completing and submitting a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the following February 15.   On some occasions a student may be approved to defer their enrollment for a second year. In such cases the student must reapply for all types of financial aid by submitting both a new CSS PROFILE and a new FAFSA by February 15 prior to the fall semester of entry.     ********************************************************************                     Renewal Eligibility    Financial aid awards are not automatically renewed each year. Students must apply for aid each year to renew their eligibility for all types of assistance (including NYU scholarships), continue to demonstrate financial need, make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements, and be in good academic standing.          ********************************************************************                    Citizenship Documentation   Students who are not U.S.citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought. You will be contacted if this applies to you. U.S. citizens may also be required to document their citizenship status.            To be eligible for aid from NYU and from federal and state government sources, students must be classified either as U.S. citizens or as eligible non-citizens. Students are considered to be eligible non-citizens for financial aid purposes if one of the following conditions applies:                  U.S. permanent resident with an Alien Registration Receipt Card I-551 (\"green card\").    Other eligible non-citizen with an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) showing any one of the following designations: (a) \"Refugee,\" (b) \"Indefinite Parole,\" (c) \"Humanitarian Parole,\" (d) \"Asylum Granted,\" or (e)\"Cuban-Haitian Entrant.\"             ********************************************************************             NYU Employees and Their Dependents   Members of New York University staff, faculty, and officers or  administrators, and their dependents who are eligible for tuition  remission are encouraged to apply for financial aid (by submitting the  FAFSA). Financial aid consists of Federal Subsidized Loans, Federal  Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants and the  Federal TEACH Grant, as well as private (non-federal) alternative loan  programs. Please contact the NYU Benefits Office for details about tuition remission, and learn also how to apply online . Please  note, if you were offered an NYU Scholarship and you have elected to  utilize tuition remission, you are no longer eligible for the NYU  Scholarship.     ********************************************************************                   Social Security Administration   Students who wish to apply for federal financial aid must include their Social Security number on the NYU Application for Admission (or provide it to the University Registrar following enrollment) and on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).            The federal government will confirm that the Social Security number on the FAFSA application matches other data in their files. Students whose records do not match will be required to verify their Social Security number. If you have changed your name you must notify the Social Security Administration before financial aid can be disbursed. See their web site for more information: www.ssa.gov        ********************************************************************                   Selective Service System   Males born on or after January 1, 1960 must register with Selective Service to qualify for federal aid. The federal government may require students to verify registration. Financial aid cannot be secured without such verification. See the Selective Service web site for more information: www.sss.gov       ********************************************************************               Tax Information and Income/Asset Verification   It is not necessary to submit copies of your tax returns or any other family financial records or supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid unless you are specifically asked for additional information. Unsolicited material will be destroyed without review. If you have unusual financial circumstances that may increase your eligibility for financial aid, contact the Office of Financial Aid AFTER you have received your award letter.   You may also be required to provide appropriate tax records if your application for financial aid is selected by the U.S. Department of Education for income and asset verification. You will be notified if this is necessary. The verification process may result in an adjustment to your financial aid award, and can occur at any time throughout the year. If you do not provide tax returns when requested, your financial aid may be revoked.     Go to Verification       ********************************************************************               Withdrawal   Students should refer to the official academic withdrawal policy described in their school bulletin, and then use the Semester Withdrawal Form available on NYU Albert (see information at the University Registrar ). For students receiving federal aid who withdraw completely before attending 60 percent of the semester, NYU is required to calculate how much of federal student aid funds must be returned. Those receiving federal aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining balances resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. The amount of federal aid &quot;earned&quot; is determined by the withdrawal date and a calculation based upon the federal formula. Generally, federal assistance is earned on a pro-rata basis. The withdrawal date is calculated based on the date the withdrawal form is submitted, unless the University has other information that demonstrates the withdrawal and/or last day of attendance was an earlier date.   The portion of federal aid that was not earned by a student will be returned from the appropriate federal student aid program(s) in the following order, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG).

Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the Satisfactory Academic Progress standard defined here, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     TRADITIONAL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS   To be considered for financial aid each year, students must make satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their degree requirements. Students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of 76 percent of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   ADVANCED PLACEMENT, ADVANCED STANDING AND TRANSFER STUDENTS   Accepted credit points from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status are considered to be attempted and completed credits for the purpose of evaluating satisfactory academic progress.   HEOP AND CSTEP   Undergraduate students participating in the New York State Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) or the New York State Collegiate Science &amp; Technology Entry Program (CSTEP) must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status) in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   PAUL MCGHEE DIVISION   SCPS Paul McGhee Division students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P, including accepted credits from Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, and Transfer Student status)in a minimum of two-thirds (67 percent) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters) and maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0.   GRADUATE STUDENTS   Graduate students must earn a passing grade (A, B, C, D, or P) in a minimum of 80 percent (67 percent for GSAS students, 75 percent for law students) of the courses in which they are enrolled each academic year (fall, spring and summer semesters).   Most graduate schools at the University require a minimum GPA of 3.0. This may vary, so you should consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic requirements published in your school's bulletin. Normal progress requires completing all courses for which you are registered and progressing toward your degree at a level that compares favorably with other registrants working toward the same degree in the same academic program.              * * * * * * *   Extending Your Financial Aid     Financial aid funding (federal, state, and campus-based) is designed to help students complete their degree requirements within a limited period of time and is generally not available beyond that point. However, in certain circumstances the Office of Financial Aid may authorize additional student funding for one or more semesters. To be considered for an extension of financial aid availability please submit an Aid Eligibility Extension Request Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .              * * * * * * *   Review of Your Academic Progress   Federal regulations require New York University to monitor the academic performance of its students for the purpose of verifying and maintaining their eligibility for federal financial aid. If you do not meet the standard of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), your federal financial aid will be suspended. In most cases, state and NYU financial aid (scholarship) require that the same criteria be maintained for continued eligibility. Some graduate schools have different eligibility criteria for their scholarships and students are encouraged to review their school/department criteria accordingly.     NYU does not offer ESL or remedial courses for credit towards any of its undergraduate or graduate degrees.   Most types of financial aid - including federal financial aid - require students be enrolled in courses that are necessary to fulfill their degree requirements; therefore, students enrolling in an excessive number of electives that are not applicable to their degree may have their financial aid revoked. To ensure applicable courses are taken, students are encouraged to seek out guidance from their academic advisors.     For students who change schools or change majors within NYU, all credits that count towards their degree in their new school or towards their new major are considered both attempted credits and earned credits. Credits that are not applied towards the degree in the student\u2019s new school or towards their new major count neither as attempted credits nor as earned credits.   All repeated courses count as both attempted and earned credits and all types of incompletes count as attempted credits but not as earned credits.     An academic progress calculator is available here as a guide to your status.   The Office of Financial Aid typically conducts a SAP review at least annually at the conclusion of each academic year, and students who do not meet the requirement receive a notice on their NYU Albert account.   FINANCIAL AID SUSPENSION   Students who do not meet the SAP requirement are automatically placed on financial aid suspension (unless the student is approved for financial aid probation, see below). During suspension, the student will not be eligible for financial aid. (Students may continue to acquire private non-NYU scholarships and private non-federal loans.) Eligibility for financial aid will be returned when the student meets the SAP standard.   FINANCIAL AID PROBATION   All students have the right to appeal the suspension of their financial aid. Students may appeal only once for each academic degree in most circumstances (an exception may be granted in the event of illness or injury).   You may avoid financial aid suspension by asking to be placed on financial aid probation, which requires the submission of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeal Form, available on our Applications and Forms menu .   Students who are approved will be placed on financial aid probation for one semester. The student will remain eligible for financial aid and will continue to receive financial assistance during the approved probationary semester.   Students who meet the SAP standard at the end of their probationary semester will be restored to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. Students who do not meet the SAP requirements at the end of the probationary period will be placed on financial aid suspension (described above).   Students are permitted only one semester of financial aid probation. If a student meets the SAP requirement at the end of their probationary semester but later fails again to meet the SAP requirement, the student is not eligible for additional financial aid probation, except in the event of illness or injury.   NOTICE: The current SAP standard for traditional undergraduate students is effective beginning summer semester 2011. Traditional undergraduates who attended spring semester 2011 and earlier will first be evaluated using the current SAP standard, and if a student does not meet this standard, they will then be evaluated based on the SAP standard in effect before summer semester 2011 .     ********************************************************************             Enrollment Status   To be considered for any type of student aid you must be officially admitted to New York University or matriculated in a degree program, and be making satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements. Students in certain certificate or diploma programs may also be eligible for consideration. Generally, University-administered aid is awarded only to full-time students.   Part-Time Status :Part-time students (fewer than 12 points per semester) may be eligible for a Federal Direct Loan or a Federal Direct PLUS Loan, but they must also maintain satisfactory academic progress. Undergraduate students may also be eligible for Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) (New York State residents only \u2014 separate application available here ) or for Pell Grants.     Half-Time/Full-Time Equivalency :Graduate students may be eligible for a half-time or full-time equivalency, based upon the determination of their academic department,even if they are not enrolled for actual credits. Limited financial aid may be available to students with posted equivalencies. Cost of attendance for students with equivalencies is based upon living and miscellaneous expenses and not tuition and fees.       Deferred Enrollment   Freshmen applicants who have been offered admission to NYU may submit a request to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions to defer their enrollment for up to one year. Students approved for deferral who received a financial aid package with their original offer of admission can expect that the NYU portion of their package (University scholarships and grants) will also be deferred and received in full as originally offered. It is not necessary to resubmit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE, and scholarship eligibility will not be reevaluated. Deferred students must, however, reapply for any federal or state funds that were awarded as part of the original package by completing and submitting a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the following February 15.   On some occasions a student may be approved to defer their enrollment for a second year. In such cases the student must reapply for all types of financial aid by submitting both a new CSS PROFILE and a new FAFSA by February 15 prior to the fall semester of entry.     ********************************************************************                     Renewal Eligibility    Financial aid awards are not automatically renewed each year. Students must apply for aid each year to renew their eligibility for all types of assistance (including NYU scholarships), continue to demonstrate financial need, make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements, and be in good academic standing.          ********************************************************************                    Citizenship Documentation   Students who are not U.S.citizens are subject to different regulations which may require supporting documentation, depending upon the type of financial aid sought. You will be contacted if this applies to you. U.S. citizens may also be required to document their citizenship status.            To be eligible for aid from NYU and from federal and state government sources, students must be classified either as U.S. citizens or as eligible non-citizens. Students are considered to be eligible non-citizens for financial aid purposes if one of the following conditions applies:                  U.S. permanent resident with an Alien Registration Receipt Card I-551 (\"green card\").    Other eligible non-citizen with an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) showing any one of the following designations: (a) \"Refugee,\" (b) \"Indefinite Parole,\" (c) \"Humanitarian Parole,\" (d) \"Asylum Granted,\" or (e)\"Cuban-Haitian Entrant.\"             ********************************************************************             NYU Employees and Their Dependents   Members of New York University staff, faculty, and officers or  administrators, and their dependents who are eligible for tuition  remission are encouraged to apply for financial aid (by submitting the  FAFSA). Financial aid consists of Federal Subsidized Loans, Federal  Unsubsidized Loans, Federal PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants and the  Federal TEACH Grant, as well as private (non-federal) alternative loan  programs. Please contact the NYU Benefits Office for details about tuition remission, and learn also how to apply online . Please  note, if you were offered an NYU Scholarship and you have elected to  utilize tuition remission, you are no longer eligible for the NYU  Scholarship.     ********************************************************************                   Social Security Administration   Students who wish to apply for federal financial aid must include their Social Security number on the NYU Application for Admission (or provide it to the University Registrar following enrollment) and on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).            The federal government will confirm that the Social Security number on the FAFSA application matches other data in their files. Students whose records do not match will be required to verify their Social Security number. If you have changed your name you must notify the Social Security Administration before financial aid can be disbursed. See their web site for more information: www.ssa.gov        ********************************************************************                   Selective Service System   Males born on or after January 1, 1960 must register with Selective Service to qualify for federal aid. The federal government may require students to verify registration. Financial aid cannot be secured without such verification. See the Selective Service web site for more information: www.sss.gov       ********************************************************************               Tax Information and Income/Asset Verification   It is not necessary to submit copies of your tax returns or any other family financial records or supporting documentation to the Office of Financial Aid unless you are specifically asked for additional information. Unsolicited material will be destroyed without review. If you have unusual financial circumstances that may increase your eligibility for financial aid, contact the Office of Financial Aid AFTER you have received your award letter.   You may also be required to provide appropriate tax records if your application for financial aid is selected by the U.S. Department of Education for income and asset verification. You will be notified if this is necessary. The verification process may result in an adjustment to your financial aid award, and can occur at any time throughout the year. If you do not provide tax returns when requested, your financial aid may be revoked.     Go to Verification       ********************************************************************               Withdrawal   Students should refer to the official academic withdrawal policy described in their school bulletin, and then use the Semester Withdrawal Form available on NYU Albert (see information at the University Registrar ). For students receiving federal aid who withdraw completely before attending 60 percent of the semester, NYU is required to calculate how much of federal student aid funds must be returned. Those receiving federal aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining balances resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. The amount of federal aid &quot;earned&quot; is determined by the withdrawal date and a calculation based upon the federal formula. Generally, federal assistance is earned on a pro-rata basis. The withdrawal date is calculated based on the date the withdrawal form is submitted, unless the University has other information that demonstrates the withdrawal and/or last day of attendance was an earlier date.   The portion of federal aid that was not earned by a student will be returned from the appropriate federal student aid program(s) in the following order, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan, Federal Direct Subsidized Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Graduate PLUS Loan, Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant, and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG).

and Applied Theatre - Call For Proposals            April 23-25, 2010 NYU&#39;s Program in Educational Theatre is a leader in applied theatre. Through our extensive curricular offerings (which range from undergraduate to doctoral programs of study), we, as practitioners, are constantly investigating dialogical forms of theatre through which it is possible to explore social activity, pedagogy, politics and citizenship. These aspirations drive applied theatre, a movement involving the use of drama and theatre in non-traditional venues that promote citizenship within varying communities. The goal of this forum is to facilitate a dialogue on citizenship and applied theatre contexts through exploring the field of arts-based community engagement. The forum will also investigate the perceived boundaries and barriers for artist/educators committed to understanding the roles and responsibilities of citizens in both local and global communities. Forum participants will engage in workshops and sessions exploring the link between applied theatre and citizenship; use theatre to critically reflect on historical events, discovering their influence on contemporary culture, public policies and our individual lives; and develop a language of possibility within a narrowly defined, outcome-based culture. For our 2010 Forum, we invite artists, educators, representatives from arts organizations and researchers to share and discuss their work. Proposals should address one or more of the following questions and/or sub-questions: 1) What is a citizen artist?  What is the contemporary role of citizenship in arts education and/or applied theatre? Who is the citizen artist, and what are their responsibilities in citizenship education? 2) How can drama provide a forum to explore ideas of global citizenship?  What are innovative strategies for using drama to stimulate dialogue, interaction and change? How is theatre being used to rehabilitate people in prisons, health facilities, and elsewhere? How can applied theatre encourage global citizenship for participants of all ages? 3) How do we prepare future artists/educators for work in applied theatre?  What ethical questions should the artist/educator consider in their work? In what ways are aesthetics important in applied theatre? How do we negotiate a commitment to both the process and product of applied theatre work? How do artist/educators assess participants&#39; understandings in an applied theatre project? We are accepting proposals in one of four formats: 1. Paper Presentations : Participants should submit a title and 100-word abstract articulating the ways in which the paper relates to one or more of the conference questions. Papers will be selected for moderated panels based on topic areas at the discretion of the conference committee. Each panelist will have 15 minutes to present their work, followed by a moderated discussion between fellow presenters and conference participants. 2. Workshops : Participants should submit a title and 100-word description of their workshop, articulating the ways in which the workshop relates to one or more of the conference questions. In this context, a workshop is defined as an interactive experience between the conference participants and the workshop facilitator(s), not as a lecture/demonstration. Workshops will be given 90-minute time slots. 3. Performance of Applied Theatre Project : Participants should submit a title and a 100-word abstract of a scene, or excerpt of an applied theatre project (20 minutes maximum) for presentation and reflection at the conference. Abstracts should articulate the ways in which the performance relates to one or more of the conference questions. Performance submissions featuring all age groups are welcomed and encouraged. 4. Narratives : Participants should submit a title and 100-word abstract of a narrative presentation that illuminates an applied theatre project. Media that supports the narratives are encouraged for presentation and reflection at the conference. In this context, a narrative presentation refers to one&#39;s experience and personal account of an applied theatre project. Abstracts should articulate how the narratives relate to one or more of the conference questions. All technical requests must be included in the proposal. Please understand, due to limited space and resources, the committee may not be able to accommodate all requests. Submissions are due January 5 th , 2010. Please submit proposals to: applied.theatre.forum@gmail.com You will receive a confirmation email when we receive your proposal. Notification of accepted proposals will be emailed on or before February 15, 2010. Submissions must include a picture and 50 word-biography of each presenter.
