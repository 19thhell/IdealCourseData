Continuous Matriculation    All degree and certificate candidates must maintain continuous matriculation during their entire program. This is normally done by completing relevant course work each Fall &amp; Spring semester. Students in good standing who are making satisfactory progress towards completion of their program but must be away for a Fall and/or Spring semester, must maintain matriculation by paying a fee. Ph.D. candidates must receive approval from the Doctoral Office in order to maintain matriculation by fee.    Also, students permitted to complete a portion of their program at another accredited university must pay the matriculation fee for each Fall and/or Spring semester they are away from Stern.     Incomplete Grades    For students graduating in May, all courses with incomplete grades (IP or IF) must be completed and graded by the first Friday of May. For students graduating in January or September, all courses with incomplete grades must be completed and graded by the third Monday of the month in which they filed to graduate (ie: January or September).    Incompletes not made up by this deadline will lapse to N in the case of an IP (Incomplete Passing) and F in the case of an IF (Incomplete Failing).     IMP Courses    Stern students who participate in the International Management Program (IMP) must receive passing grades in the courses taken abroad. The student will receive Stern credit and a grade of P for courses passed abroad, even though the Stern grade point average will not be affected. Candidates for graduation must have their IMP transcripts submitted to the Office of Records and Registration by the second Friday of the month in which they plan to graduate.     Scholastic Requirements    All degree and certificate candidates (except for Ph.D. students) must have a minimum grade point average of 2.5000 in order to graduate. Ph.D. candidates must have a minimum grade point average of 3.0000.     Transfer Credits    Students granted permission to complete a portion of their program at another accredited institution must receive grades of B or better in the approved courses in order to receive transfer credit. Those who are away from Stern for a Fall and/or Spring semester must maintain matriculation by paying the appropriate fee. In addition, candidates for graduation must have their transcript forwarded to the Office of Records and Registration by the second Friday of the month in which they plan to graduate.     Tuition and Fees    All financial obligations (including tuition and fees, library fines and books, housing charges) must be met before a student will be allowed to graduate. In addition, the University reserves the right to withhold all information regarding the record of any student in arrears in paying tuition, fees, loans or other charges                                                                                                      Graduation Info     Graduation Requirements                           News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.
