Description       The problems and pleasures of translation have shaped cultural, economic, intellectual, religious, and diplomatic interactions for centuries. Emily Apter has noted that \u201cthe 9/11 tragedy, followed on its heels by the Iraq invasion and occupation, has contributed to the focus on translation in film, fiction, academic research, and the media.\u201d In an increasingly globalized and technologized world, we translate across linguistic and cultural boundaries all the time. Looking at translation as a powerful dynamic in our daily interactions helps us to understand the world in which we live. In this seminar, we will explore many aspects of cross-linguistic communication, including language acquisition, textual translation, professional interpreting, and the role of technology in translation. In addition to reading and comparing translations of literary texts, we will engage with theoretical works about translation, statements written by translators about their craft and profession, and recent news articles about the politics of translation and translation in politics. In various essays and projects, students will be encouraged to pursue a range of topics that reflect their interests and curiosities about language and intercultural exchange. Readings may include works by Apter, David Bellos, Edith Grossman, Octavio Paz, and Lawrence Vanuti.

The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.

Postintermediate Courses in Language, Culture, and Literature (100 Level)    These are \"bridge\" courses between basic language study and more advanced courses. The common goal of courses at this level is to consolidate students' command of spoken and written German, to review advanced structures of the language, and to provide core information that will be needed in advanced study of literature and culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All courses at this level are conducted in German.

The works of Austrian writers, artists, architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama), film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl. This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course will involve visits to museums in New York, such as the Neue Galerie.    Introduction to German Literature GERM-UA 152 Offered every year. 4 points. Required for the German major. Introduces students to representative authors and works of German literature, with emphasis on the modern period. Students learn basic conventions of literature and literary interpretation, as well as strategies for the effective reading of shorter and longer prose works, drama, and poetry. Guided writing assignments focus on developing the language skills necessary for effective written analysis and interpretation of literary texts in German.    Techniques of Translation GERM-UA 153 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the history, theory, and practice of translation through German and English texts taken from a variety of cultural backgrounds. While engaging in the craft of translation firsthand, students encounter diverse grammatical, syntactical, and stylistic problems, thus gaining a deeper understanding of the German language. Also stresses the acquisition of vocabulary and complex idiomatic structures necessary for effective reading comprehension, as well as written expression.       Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in English (200 Level)    Courses at the 200 level are conducted in English. Literature-oriented courses at this level may count in fulfillment of the College's minor in literature in translation. Many of these courses are cross-listed with other NYU departments or programs. No knowledge of German is required for courses at this level, and there are no prerequisites.    Introduction to German Culture GERM-UA 220 Offered periodically. 4 points. German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence on the history of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing students with some of the most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche; the music of Mozart and Wagner; the literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht; as well as the art movements of dada and Bauhaus all serve as the basis for a discussion of the complex constellation of \"kultur,\" politics, and power in the German intellectual tradition.    Marx, Nietzsche, Freud GERM-UA 240 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the work of these three seminal authors by focusing on their notions of interpretation, history, subjectivity, politics, religion, and art. The seminar does not present their work chronologically, but rather creates a dialogue between the authors around each topic and, thereby, delineates the origins of much modern thought.    The German Intellectual Tradition GERM-UA 244 Offered periodically. 4 points. Designed to familiarize students with the major currents of German intellectual and literary history.

Materials include works of literature, theory, film, and the visual arts.    Madness and Genius GERM-UA 285 Offered periodically. 4 points. Explores the relationship among talent, inspiration, and psychological instability in works of the 19th and 20th centuries. Considers the link between inspiration and possession, Western culture's valorization of originality, the political purpose of characterizing originality as psychologically transgressive, and the allegorization of the creative process through depictions of madness.

Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in German (300 Level)    Courses at this level provide a broad historical overview of specific periods in German literary and cultural development. Advanced German language skills are practiced, with particular emphasis on the ability to summarize and on the expression of supported opinion. Students read more texts of greater linguistic and conceptual complexity than those used at the 100 level, although readings consist primarily of short works and excerpts. Readings are drawn from literary and nonliterary sources.    It is recommended that students complete GERM-UA 152 or the equivalent before enrolling in courses at the 300 level.    Romanticism GERM-UA 349 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Traces the development of romanticism in Germany in the period 1789-1830.

Johann Fausten; Goethe's Urfaust and excerpts from his later dramatic versions (Faust, Ein Fragment; Faust I and II); and Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus.    Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points. Each of these courses provides advanced students of German with an in-depth knowledge of one major author of either the 19th or 20th century. Works of the chosen author are examined in terms of how he or she contributes to, and possibly challenges, prevailing aesthetic, political, and cultural trends of his or her time.

Description       The problems and pleasures of translation have shaped cultural, economic, intellectual, religious, and diplomatic interactions for centuries. Emily Apter has noted that \u201cthe 9/11 tragedy, followed on its heels by the Iraq invasion and occupation, has contributed to the focus on translation in film, fiction, academic research, and the media.\u201d In an increasingly globalized and technologized world, we translate across linguistic and cultural boundaries all the time. Looking at translation as a powerful dynamic in our daily interactions helps us to understand the world in which we live. In this seminar, we will explore many aspects of cross-linguistic communication, including language acquisition, textual translation, professional interpreting, and the role of technology in translation. In addition to reading and comparing translations of literary texts, we will engage with theoretical works about translation, statements written by translators about their craft and profession, and recent news articles about the politics of translation and translation in politics. In various essays and projects, students will be encouraged to pursue a range of topics that reflect their interests and curiosities about language and intercultural exchange. Readings may include works by Apter, David Bellos, Edith Grossman, Octavio Paz, and Lawrence Vanuti.

The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.

Postintermediate Courses in Language, Culture, and Literature (100 Level)    These are \"bridge\" courses between basic language study and more advanced courses. The common goal of courses at this level is to consolidate students' command of spoken and written German, to review advanced structures of the language, and to provide core information that will be needed in advanced study of literature and culture. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of complex reading and writing skills and their integration with speaking skills. All courses at this level are conducted in German. All German courses at the 100 level require successful completion of GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20, or permission of the department.

The works of Austrian writers, artists, architects, composers, and thinkers will be studied against the backdrop of the political and social climate of the Habsburg monarchy\u2019s final years. Works from a wide variety of fields\u2014including literary texts (poetry, prose, and drama), film, music, art, architecture, philosophy, and psychology\u2014form the core of this course. We will consider how cultural production is both shaped by and reflects its historical context. Figures we will engage with include Sigmund Freud, Arthur Schnitzler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Gustav Klimt, Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg, Gustav Mahler, Adolf Loos, Theodor Herzl, and Berta Zuckerkandl. This course is a 100-level, post-intermediate course in German, which will also focus on language acquisition at the advanced level. A portion of the course will involve visits to museums in New York, such as the Neue Galerie.    Introduction to German Literature GERM-UA 152 Offered every year. 4 points.

Advanced Literature and Culture Courses Conducted in English (200 Level)    Courses at the 200 level are conducted in English. Literature-oriented courses at this level may count in fulfillment of the College's minor in literature in translation. Many of these courses are cross-listed with other NYU departments or programs. No knowledge of German is required for courses at this level, and there are no prerequisites.    Introduction to German Culture GERM-UA 220 Offered periodically. 4 points. German thinkers and artists have exerted a profound influence on the history of philosophy, aesthetics, literature, and science. This course aims not only at providing an introduction to crucial periods and events in German cultural history since the Enlightenment, but also at familiarizing students with some of the most important figures in modern intellectual and aesthetic history. The philosophies of Kant and Nietzsche; the music of Mozart and Wagner; the literary contributions of Lessing, Goethe, Fontane, and Brecht; as well as the art movements of dada and Bauhaus all serve as the basis for a discussion of the complex constellation of \"kultur,\" politics, and power in the German intellectual tradition.    Marx, Nietzsche, Freud GERM-UA 240 Offered periodically. 4 points.

Explores the relationship among talent, inspiration, and psychological instability in works of the 19th and 20th centuries. Considers the link between inspiration and possession, Western culture's valorization of originality, the political purpose of characterizing originality as psychologically transgressive, and the allegorization of the creative process through depictions of madness.

During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points.
