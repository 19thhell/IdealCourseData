Curriculum   Required Core Courses (12 credits)   3.00 Credits Quality Control and Improvement IE-GY 6113 This course provides students with a solid foundation in the cost of quality, quality assurance and quality management. Emphasis is on the basic tools of quality control such as control charts and their use, the concept of \u201cout of control,\u201d acceptance sampling, variables and attributes charts and producer\u2019s and consumer\u2019s risk. A unique aspect of this course is the demonstration of the power of teams of people with different expertise to improve quality. A course project is required. Prerequisite: MA-GY 6513 or familiarity with the concepts of probability and statistics. Also listed under MN-GY 6113. 3.00 Credits Facility Planning and Design IE-GY 6213 Topics in this course include facilities design for global competitiveness, strategic master-site planning, site selection, factory layout and design, facility-management systems and materials handling and storage planning. Also presented are guidance on selecting alternative facility plans and application of queuing methods and computer modeling for facility design and evaluation. 3.00 Credits Factory Simulation IE-GY 6823 This course examines modeling and simulation of complex industrial, commercial and service systems, such as factories and hospitals. Students develop, run and test several simulation models using different software packages. Prerequisite: Computer literacy. 3.00 Credits Production Science MN-GY 7893 This course reviews just-in-time and synchronous manufacturing methods. It analyzes the basic dynamics of factories to understand the importance of congestion and bottleneck rates on cycle time and inventories. Analytical models are developed to study variability and randomness introduced by breakdown, setups and batching. Simulation studies are used to provide data on performance of transfer lines.   9 Credits with Either IE or MN Designation Elective (course selection optional)   3.00 Credits Production Planning and Control IE-GY 6193 This is a survey course in basic and advanced manufacturing planning and control systems, covering short-term forecasting systems, master production scheduling, material requirements planning, inventory management, capacity management, production activity control and just-in-time. 3.00 Credits Target Costing MN-GY 7503 Target Costing is a disciplined process for determining and realizing a total cost at which a product with specified functionality must be produced to generate the desired profitability at its anticipated selling price. This course presents both the theoretical foundation and the practical application of Target Costing methodology to the product-realization process. The topics include basic accounting, principles of Target Costing, the Target Costing Process, quantifying the customer requirements, defining the product feature set, price forecasting, experience curves, cost- functionality tradeoffs and implementation check lists. The course includes a hands-on design project in which teams of students will apply the principles of target costing to design a new product. 3.00 Credits Lean Manufacturing MN-GY 7873 This course provides an overview to the basic principles, and theories of lean manufacturing which involves identifying and eliminating non-value-adding activities in design, production, and supply chain management. Students will learn an integrated approach to efficient manufacturing with emphasis on synchronized product, quick changeover, cell design, visual factory, value stream, one-piece flow and learn metrics. 3.00 Credits Design for Manufacturability MN-GY 7923 This course introduces concepts and techniques for economical, functionally sound and high-quality product design for manufacture. The emphasis is on designing for easy robotic and manual assembly, and on using plastics effectively to reduce manufacturing costs. Managerial and organizational approaches and case studies of successful designs are reviewed. Also listed as IE-GY 7923. 3.00 Credits Basics of Supply Chain Operations Management MN-GY 7953 Supply chain operations seeks to integrate and accelerate the flow of materials, information and cash, throughout the process of supplying goods or services. Supply chain operations optimizes the efforts of suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, distributors, retailers and customers to create an efficient and robust process. On the service side the same concepts prevail with the suppliers, institutions, providers, administrators and customers. All businesses are part of a supply chain, and understanding and realizing this relationship leads to economies of time, material, money and improved customer service 3.00 Credits Electronics System Manufacturing MN-GY 7963 In this course, students understand that the physical design and manufacturability of modern electronics systems results from tradeoffs involving partitioning, electrical performance, cooling and mechanical stresses. Design parameters are derived to study the tradeoffs, along with specific examples from reverse-engineering studies. The current status and future directions of lowcost, high-volume manufacturing technologies are examined.   Elective 9 Credits   Please speak with your academic advisor for qualifying courses.
