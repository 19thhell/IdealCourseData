Among the most arresting features is the extensive but decidedly low-tech collection of classic board games in the Open Library. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t try to write a book before reading one,&rdquo; Dylan McKenzie, the Program Coordinator of NYU&rsquo;s Game Center, now located at MAGNET, said. &ldquo;In the same way, we want our students to be familiar with all types of games before trying to design one.

Addressing the gathering, NYU Provost David McLaughlin asserted that MAGNET was setting new standards for interschool collaboration and said, &ldquo;What a great acronym &mdash; and a great metaphor, since we are literally drawing together faculty and students from different departments and even different boroughs.&rdquo;   The crowd -- which included Borough President Marty Markowitz, Council Member Steve Levin, State Senator Martin Golden, Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce Chair Denise Arbesu, and Downtown Brooklyn Partnership President Tucker Reed, among other dignitaries -- was given a chance to tour MAGNET&rsquo;s state-of-the-art classrooms, labs, black-box theater, and recording studio.   Markowitz commented that it was evident that we had &ldquo;come a long way from Pong and Atari, let alone [the traditional childhood games] Skully and Jacks.&rdquo; Citing a recent industry forecast that the global market for video games is expected to grow from $67 billion in 2012 to $82 billion in 2017, he said, &ldquo;Gaming is set to be bigger than either the music or film business. It represents a lot of tax revenue!&rdquo;   NYU President John Sexton enthusiastically stressed the significance of MAGNET&rsquo;s opening, proclaiming, &ldquo;There are times when you realize that you&rsquo;re looking at the future, and this is one of them.&rdquo;   His statement was a comment on not only the innovative work being done by MAGNET&rsquo;s students and faculty but on what the facility means for Brooklyn as an epicenter of hot new technology and NYU&rsquo;s latest home. &ldquo;NYU is doing great things in this borough,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;from our merger with Poly, which brings engineering back to NYU for the first time in decades, the establishment of the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), and, of course, MAGNET.&rdquo; Alluding to Downtown Brooklyn&rsquo;s Tech Triangle, he continued, &ldquo;I am so proud that NYU&rsquo;s growth in Brooklyn is happening at the same time as the borough&rsquo;s ascendance as a technological capital of the world.&rdquo;                                              News    Posted April 27th, 2015  Inno/Vention Demo Day: Learning by Demonstrating  As Attacks Multiply, AIG CEO Hancock Calls for Stronger Cyber Insurance Posted April 9th, 2015  The Jacobs Women: Helping Build a Legacy Posted March 26th, 2015  New Faculty, New Breakthroughs Posted March 19th, 2015        Cable   News from Cable alumni magazine.

Essential resources seldom enjoyed by newly created centers prime CUSP for its ambitions. Among them are:   Physical   CUSP\u2019s long-term home will be 150,000 square feet of renovated space in 370 Jay Street in Downtown Brooklyn, adjacent to the NYU-Poly campus. An adaptive reuse approach will be used to renovate the rest of the building, which will contain an additional 40,000 square feet of business incubator space. Renovations are expected to be complete in 2017.   CUSP\u2019s interim home will be in MetroTech, where NYU-Poly is located. The layout includes 35 private offices, 48 open workstations, two large visualization labs, a light electronics lab, two conference rooms, a 70-person seminar room, and seven flexible collaboration spaces. This space will house faculty, partner researchers from CUSP\u2019s corporate partners, PhD candidates and postdoctoral researchers, administrative staff as well as research and teaching labs.   CUSP\u2019s classrooms and a server room will share space with the NYU Game Center in an adjacent MetroTech building. The Game Center is a collaboration of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences; Polytechnic Institute of NYU; Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development; and Tisch School of the Arts.     Intellectual   CUSP draws its research strength from an extraordinary consortium \u2013 leading institutions of higher learning, leaders in the tech industry, and leaders in public service \u2014 that individually rank among the most prominent in their sectors, and together form an unsurpassed whole. Combined with the extensive urban and sustainability research strengths of multiple schools and departments at NYU and NYU-Poly, CUSP is well-positioned to become the global leader in the study of urban informatics.     Technological   Since CUSP\u2019s research activities revolve around the collection, analysis, and storage of big data, it requires significant IT resources. Our plans include a multi-petabyte storage facility coupled with local computing clusters composed of a few thousand cores, and access to larger facilities in the cloud. Extensive visualization and data analysis facilities, including two high-resolution display walls, are also planned.   In addition to CUSP-specific IT resources, NYU and NYU-Poly have substantial computing resources that will also be available to CUSP students, staff, and faculty. Such resources include super computing facilities, long-term data storage, high-end computing labs, and site licenses for all major statistical, visualization, and GIS commercial software.                             CUSP is a unique public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory and classroom to help cities around the world become more productive, livable, equitable, and resilient. CUSP observes, analyzes, and models cities to optimize outcomes, prototype new solutions, formalize new tools and processes, and develop new expertise/experts. These activities will make CUSP the world\u2019s leading authority in the emerging field of \u201cUrban Informatics.\u201d  Contact Us Center for Urban   Science + Progress   1 MetroTech Center, 19th Floor   Brooklyn, NY 11201      (646) 997-0500 (office)   (646) 997-0560 (main fax) Admissions Fax: (646) 997-0550   Admissions Information: cusp.admissions@nyu.edu   General Inquiries: cusp-information@nyu.edu  Quick Links  Home   About   Events   MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics   People   Partners   Contact   MyCusp Login    MS in Applied Urban Science and Informatics           Overview     Curriculum     Projects     Admissions Requirements     Financial Aid and Tuition                                     \u00a9 2015 NYU CUSP.
