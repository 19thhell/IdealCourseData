the news media, communications, education, scientific research, and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.   Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.   A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in broad contexts. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees. The goal of the program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible specializations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.     The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields. Computer science and technology enable students to develop the skills needed to supplement their careers and interests. All levels are accommodated, regardless of prior knowledge. Those with adequate computer experience may take advanced classes. Students are introduced to the advancements that are being made in computers and the Internet, and gain practical knowledge of this field. The courses enable students to obtain the essential background to enter this dynamic field and/or to acquire important skills to support their own major.

How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this effect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. This course is intended for students from different disciplines (outside the sciences); no prerequisite is needed.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

An algorithm is an effective procedure, expressed as a finite list of precisely defined instructions, for solving problems that arise in applications in any domain of knowledge. All computer programs are translations of algorithms into some programming language. Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course covers the foundations of the design and analysis of algorithms at an advanced level, focusing on proving the correctness of algorithms, analyzing their computational efficiency, and designing efficient algorithms. The algorithms studied are taken from a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, heuristic search, pattern recognition, machine learning, music, bioinformatics, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.

It can be difficult to instruct by means of languages what we want a computer to do, and it can be easy to write programs that are incomprehensible or even incorrect, leading to disastrous consequences. An ideal computer language makes the difficult problem easy and the easy problem difficult. In this course the student are exposed to the four major categories of programming languages: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Specific languages are chosen for illustration. Topics to be covered include fundamental issues, lambda-calculus, type systems, scoping, concurrency, modularization, control flow, and semantics.

Artificial intelligence is the problem of developing computer systems that can carry out these tasks. Topics to be covered include heuristic search (A* Algorithm); problem solving; automated reasoning; reasoning with uncertainty; machine learning; perceptrons; Bayesian networks; hidden Markov models; and applications to areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, music processing, computer games, robotics, and planning.

We all use this technology routinely to obtain information about almost anything in our daily lives. A database is a site that stores information or data in an organized way, together with supporting data structures and database languages that permit users to effect operations such as visualizing data, searching data, deleting old data, and inserting new data, in a secure way. In this course students learn the basic techniques for designing and managing databases useful in a variety of applications ranging from websites and banking systems, to video games.

Computer graphics deals with almost everything other than text and sound, and is therefore dominated by the visual aspects of computing. It is concerned with the design of algorithms, programs, graphics languages, graphics data structures, display devices, and systems for creating realistic images, and processing visual inputs such as photographs, drawings, movies, animations, or simulations.

This course teaches students the design and implementation of such Internet-scale networks and networked systems. Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large scale networks and systems. Topics include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, overlay networks and applications, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Examples are drawn primarily from the Internet.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

A grade of C or better is necessary in all of the four courses to fulfill the requirements of the concentration. The required courses are: Introduction to Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms, and 1 Elective. The concentration in Computer Science does not count toward the fulfillment of the concentration requirement for Computer Science majors.

the news media, communications, education, scientific research, and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.   Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.   A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in broad contexts. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees. The goal of the program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible specializations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.     The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields. Computer science and technology enable students to develop the skills needed to supplement their careers and interests. All levels are accommodated, regardless of prior knowledge. Those with adequate computer experience may take advanced classes.

How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this effect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. This course is intended for students from different disciplines (outside the sciences); no prerequisite is needed.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

An algorithm is an effective procedure, expressed as a finite list of precisely defined instructions, for solving problems that arise in applications in any domain of knowledge. All computer programs are translations of algorithms into some programming language. Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course covers the foundations of the design and analysis of algorithms at an advanced level, focusing on proving the correctness of algorithms, analyzing their computational efficiency, and designing efficient algorithms. The algorithms studied are taken from a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, heuristic search, pattern recognition, machine learning, music, bioinformatics, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.    Prerequistes are CS-AD 103 and CS-AD 116. (CS-AD 103 can be taken as a co-requisite for this course.)    Note: Math-AD 131 has now been changed to CS-AD 116.

It can be difficult to instruct by means of languages what we want a computer to do, and it can be easy to write programs that are incomprehensible or even incorrect, leading to disastrous consequences. An ideal computer language makes the difficult problem easy and the easy problem difficult. In this course the student are exposed to the four major categories of programming languages: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Specific languages are chosen for illustration. Topics to be covered include fundamental issues, lambda-calculus, type systems, scoping, concurrency, modularization, control flow, and semantics.

Artificial intelligence is the problem of developing computer systems that can carry out these tasks. Topics to be covered include heuristic search (A* Algorithm); problem solving; automated reasoning; reasoning with uncertainty; machine learning; perceptrons; Bayesian networks; hidden Markov models; and applications to areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, music processing, computer games, robotics, and planning.

We all use this technology routinely to obtain information about almost anything in our daily lives. A database is a site that stores information or data in an organized way, together with supporting data structures and database languages that permit users to effect operations such as visualizing data, searching data, deleting old data, and inserting new data, in a secure way. In this course students learn the basic techniques for designing and managing databases useful in a variety of applications ranging from websites and banking systems, to video games.

Computer graphics deals with almost everything other than text and sound, and is therefore dominated by the visual aspects of computing. It is concerned with the design of algorithms, programs, graphics languages, graphics data structures, display devices, and systems for creating realistic images, and processing visual inputs such as photographs, drawings, movies, animations, or simulations.

This course teaches students the design and implementation of such Internet-scale networks and networked systems. Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large scale networks and systems. Topics include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, overlay networks and applications, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Examples are drawn primarily from the Internet.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

Our courses are intended for students desiring a strong background in the foundations and uses of computing.    Program Overview    Computer science is a practical art that has led to revolutionary innovations in entertainment, the humanities, health, business, the news media, communications, education, scientific research and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.    Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.    A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in a context of broad general learning. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees.    The Department of Computer Science is a part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a world renowned center for the study of mathematics and computing. As part of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) at NYU, the department offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree , two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics . The BA degree can also be pursued with honors . Students may combine our degree with others throughout the College to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics . The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates. Some of our graduating students go on to graduate study (MS or PhD) in computer science at New York University or elsewhere, while others find many career opportunities in industry upon graduation.    The goal of our program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. Majors are required to take Foundations of Science and may begin it in their second year. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible concentrations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.    The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers. More on our minor programs.    The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields.

the news media, communications, education, scientific research, and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.   Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.   A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in broad contexts. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees. The goal of the program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible specializations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.     The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields. Computer science and technology enable students to develop the skills needed to supplement their careers and interests. All levels are accommodated, regardless of prior knowledge. Those with adequate computer experience may take advanced classes. Students are introduced to the advancements that are being made in computers and the Internet, and gain practical knowledge of this field. The courses enable students to obtain the essential background to enter this dynamic field and/or to acquire important skills to support their own major.

How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this effect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. This course is intended for students from different disciplines (outside the sciences); no prerequisite is needed.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

An algorithm is an effective procedure, expressed as a finite list of precisely defined instructions, for solving problems that arise in applications in any domain of knowledge. All computer programs are translations of algorithms into some programming language. Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course covers the foundations of the design and analysis of algorithms at an advanced level, focusing on proving the correctness of algorithms, analyzing their computational efficiency, and designing efficient algorithms. The algorithms studied are taken from a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, heuristic search, pattern recognition, machine learning, music, bioinformatics, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.

It can be difficult to instruct by means of languages what we want a computer to do, and it can be easy to write programs that are incomprehensible or even incorrect, leading to disastrous consequences. An ideal computer language makes the difficult problem easy and the easy problem difficult. In this course the student are exposed to the four major categories of programming languages: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Specific languages are chosen for illustration. Topics to be covered include fundamental issues, lambda-calculus, type systems, scoping, concurrency, modularization, control flow, and semantics.

Artificial intelligence is the problem of developing computer systems that can carry out these tasks. Topics to be covered include heuristic search (A* Algorithm); problem solving; automated reasoning; reasoning with uncertainty; machine learning; perceptrons; Bayesian networks; hidden Markov models; and applications to areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, music processing, computer games, robotics, and planning.

We all use this technology routinely to obtain information about almost anything in our daily lives. A database is a site that stores information or data in an organized way, together with supporting data structures and database languages that permit users to effect operations such as visualizing data, searching data, deleting old data, and inserting new data, in a secure way. In this course students learn the basic techniques for designing and managing databases useful in a variety of applications ranging from websites and banking systems, to video games.

Computer graphics deals with almost everything other than text and sound, and is therefore dominated by the visual aspects of computing. It is concerned with the design of algorithms, programs, graphics languages, graphics data structures, display devices, and systems for creating realistic images, and processing visual inputs such as photographs, drawings, movies, animations, or simulations.

This course teaches students the design and implementation of such Internet-scale networks and networked systems. Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large scale networks and systems. Topics include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, overlay networks and applications, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Examples are drawn primarily from the Internet.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

Our courses are intended for students desiring a strong background in the foundations and uses of computing.    Program Overview    Computer science is a practical art that has led to revolutionary innovations in entertainment, the humanities, health, business, the news media, communications, education, scientific research and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.    Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.    A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in a context of broad general learning. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees.    The Department of Computer Science is a part of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, a world renowned center for the study of mathematics and computing. As part of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) at NYU, the department offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree , two minors (one in computer science, and one in web programming and applications) and a joint minor in computer science/mathematics . The BA degree can also be pursued with honors . Students may combine our degree with others throughout the College to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics . The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates. Some of our graduating students go on to graduate study (MS or PhD) in computer science at New York University or elsewhere, while others find many career opportunities in industry upon graduation.    The goal of our program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. Majors are required to take Foundations of Science and may begin it in their second year. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible concentrations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence and machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.    The minor in computer science is designed primarily for mathematics and science majors whose work will require basic programming skills. The minor in web programming and applications is designed for humanities and social sciences students who plan to use computer application software such as spreadsheets, desktop publishing, multimedia, and Internet software extensively in their careers. More on our minor programs.    The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields.

the news media, communications, education, scientific research, and the arts. It is also a science rooted in mathematics and engineering.   Although it is a relatively young field, computer science has produced many of the advances of modern life that we now take for granted. It has given medical researchers tools to understand and cure diseases, enabled physicists to reshape our understanding of the universe, allowed neuroscientists to uncover the secrets of our brains, and helped biologists decipher the human genome. Computer science has rewritten the rules of the entertainment industry and has transformed the way humans communicate with each other.   A Computer Science degree granted by a liberal arts program is of special value today, as the world increasingly needs graduates who not only possess computer skills, but also apply them in broad contexts. Graduates will be ready to take exciting and demanding jobs in the field or to continue their studies in pursuit of advanced scientific or professional degrees. The goal of the program is to train students both in the fundamental principles of computer science and in related aspects of information technology. The Computer Science program embraces a rich variety of subjects and provides great flexibility, allowing students to tailor courses of study to their particular interests. Possible specializations include computer graphics and computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, networking, databases, and software development. Advanced undergraduate students can work on research projects with faculty members engaged in projects of mutual interest.     The Computer Science program offers non-major courses for students from all backgrounds and fields. Computer science and technology enable students to develop the skills needed to supplement their careers and interests. All levels are accommodated, regardless of prior knowledge. Those with adequate computer experience may take advanced classes. Students are introduced to the advancements that are being made in computers and the Internet, and gain practical knowledge of this field. The courses enable students to obtain the essential background to enter this dynamic field and/or to acquire important skills to support their own major.

How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this effect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. This course is intended for students from different disciplines (outside the sciences); no prerequisite is needed.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

An algorithm is an effective procedure, expressed as a finite list of precisely defined instructions, for solving problems that arise in applications in any domain of knowledge. All computer programs are translations of algorithms into some programming language. Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course covers the foundations of the design and analysis of algorithms at an advanced level, focusing on proving the correctness of algorithms, analyzing their computational efficiency, and designing efficient algorithms. The algorithms studied are taken from a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, heuristic search, pattern recognition, machine learning, music, bioinformatics, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.

It can be difficult to instruct by means of languages what we want a computer to do, and it can be easy to write programs that are incomprehensible or even incorrect, leading to disastrous consequences. An ideal computer language makes the difficult problem easy and the easy problem difficult. In this course the student are exposed to the four major categories of programming languages: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Specific languages are chosen for illustration. Topics to be covered include fundamental issues, lambda-calculus, type systems, scoping, concurrency, modularization, control flow, and semantics.

Artificial intelligence is the problem of developing computer systems that can carry out these tasks. Topics to be covered include heuristic search (A* Algorithm); problem solving; automated reasoning; reasoning with uncertainty; machine learning; perceptrons; Bayesian networks; hidden Markov models; and applications to areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, music processing, computer games, robotics, and planning.

We all use this technology routinely to obtain information about almost anything in our daily lives. A database is a site that stores information or data in an organized way, together with supporting data structures and database languages that permit users to effect operations such as visualizing data, searching data, deleting old data, and inserting new data, in a secure way. In this course students learn the basic techniques for designing and managing databases useful in a variety of applications ranging from websites and banking systems, to video games.

Computer graphics deals with almost everything other than text and sound, and is therefore dominated by the visual aspects of computing. It is concerned with the design of algorithms, programs, graphics languages, graphics data structures, display devices, and systems for creating realistic images, and processing visual inputs such as photographs, drawings, movies, animations, or simulations.

This course teaches students the design and implementation of such Internet-scale networks and networked systems. Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large scale networks and systems. Topics include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, overlay networks and applications, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Examples are drawn primarily from the Internet.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.                                   This course has a discussion section .

A grade of C or better is necessary in all of the four courses to fulfill the requirements of the concentration. The required courses are: Introduction to Computer Science, Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms, and 1 Elective. The concentration in Computer Science does not count toward the fulfillment of the concentration requirement for Computer Science majors.
