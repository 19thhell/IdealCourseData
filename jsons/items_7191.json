Critical to learning cultural competency is an experiential, hands-on approach in a clinical community setting.      Practice of Medicine     The POM module establishes a patient-centered program and continuity of care forum that will facilitate learner-centered anchoring of mechanisms of disease principles in conjunction with the development of culturally competent clinical skills.      P.L.A.C.E. Program     The goals of PLACE within the Practice of Medicine module are to provide students a clinical site in which they learn about clinical medicine and interdisciplinary care while developing a patient panel that they can follow at various venues overa a longitudinal period.
