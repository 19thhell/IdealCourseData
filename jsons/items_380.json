Then followed a century of unrest involving some of the most famous events and men\u2014Caesar, Pompey, and Cato\u2014in Western history. The course surveys this vital period with a modern research interpretation. History of the Roman Empire CLASS-UA 278 Identical to HIST-UA 206. Offered every other year. 4 points. In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period. The main focus is on the fully developed system of Roman law.      Art and Archaeology Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Property CLASS-UA 100 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum. Introduction to Classical Archaeology: Constructions of the Greek and Roman Past CLASS-UA 305 Offered periodically. 4 points. An introduction to the archaeology of the Mediterranean world, examining the history and contexts of sites and monuments, as well as the methods, practices, and research models through which they have been excavated and studied. From Bronze Age palaces of the Aegean, to the Athenian Acropolis, to the cities of Alexander the Great, the Roman forum, Pompeii, and the Roman provinces, we consider the ways in which art, archaeology, architecture, everyday objects, landscape, urbanism, technology, and ritual teach us about ancient Greek and Roman societies. Special focus is placed on reception, the origins of archaeology in the Renaissance, 19th- to 20th-century humanistic and social scientific approaches, and postmodern social constructions of knowledge.

The website is www.amheida.org . Click on the Student Information button for more information on this program. The Oases of Egypt CLASS-UA 9355 Offered in the spring. 4 points. This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.        Graduate Courses Open to Undergraduates Courses in classics offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Science are open to all undergraduates who have reached the required advanced level of Greek or Latin language instruction.

Greek History from the Bronze Age to Alexander CLASS-UA 242 Identical to HIST-UA 200. Offered every other year. 4 points. Until a few decades ago, Greek history began with Homer and dealt narrowly with the Greek world. Thanks to archaeology, the social sciences, and other historical tools, the chronological and geographical horizons have been pushed back. The history of the Greeks now starts in the third millennium B.C.E. and is connected to the civilization that lay to the east, rooted in Egypt and Mesopotamia. This course traces Greek history from the Greeks' earliest appearance to the advent of Alexander. The Greek World from Alexander to Augustus CLASS-UA 243 Identical to HIST-UA 243. Offered every other year. 4 points. Continuation of the history of ancient Greece from the age of Alexander the Great in the fourth century B.C.E. until Emperor Augustus consolidated the Roman hold over the eastern Mediterranean in the first century B.C.E. These three centuries saw the relationship between Rome and the Near East become most meaningful. This course examines Alexander's conquests, the states established by his successors (Ptolemies of Egypt and Seleucids of Syria), and the increasing intervention of Rome. History of the Roman Republic CLASS-UA 267 Identical to HIST-UA 205. Offered every other year. 4 points. In the sixth century B.C.E., Rome was an obscure village. By the end of the fourth century B.C.E., Rome was master of Italy, and within another 150 years, it dominated almost all of the Mediterranean world. Then followed a century of unrest involving some of the most famous events and men\u2014Caesar, Pompey, and Cato\u2014in Western history. The course surveys this vital period with a modern research interpretation. History of the Roman Empire CLASS-UA 278 Identical to HIST-UA 206. Offered every other year. 4 points. In the spring of 44 B.C.E., Julius Caesar was murdered by a group of senators disgruntled with his monarchic ways. However, Caesar's adoptive son and heir, Gaius Octavius, was quickly on the scene, and over the course of the next half-century managed to establish himself as Rome's first emperor. About three centuries later, Constantine the Great would rise to imperial power and with him came a new state religion\u2014Christianity. This course examines the social and political history of the Roman Empire from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine and also closely observes the parallel growth of Christianity. History of Ancient Law CLASS-UA 292 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the development of law and legal systems and the relationships of these to the societies that created them, starting with some ancient Near Eastern systems and working down to the Roman period. The main focus is on the fully developed system of Roman law.      Art and Archaeology Ancient Art at Risk: Conservation, Ethics, and Cultural Property CLASS-UA 100 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. Examines the environmental, material, social, and political forces that put ancient art at risk, including exposure to natural elements, acid rain, pollution, dam building, tourism, urban development, armed conflict, looting, theft, and the illicit trade in antiquities. Issues of conservation, preservation, and ethics are considered through case studies that focus on sites, monuments, and materials. Team-taught with physical chemistry professor Norbert S. Baer of the Institute of Fine Arts Conservation Center, this course reviews a range of applied technologies used in the analysis of ancient objects: radiocarbon dating, thermoluminescence, dendrochronology, stable isotope analysis, dedolomitization, and elemental analysis. Authenticity and forgery, dating and provenance, and the sourcing of ancient materials are among the issues examined. The use of coins, inscriptions, and stamped amphora handles and ceramics is evaluated as criteria for establishing absolute and relative chronologies. Consideration is given to the role that stylistic analysis and connoisseurship have played in our understanding of ancient art. This interdisciplinary course is ideal for students who are interested in the intersection of classical archaeology with law, science, ethics, public policy, cultural resource management, and the environment. We track developments in global cultural property laws, international conventions, and the repatriation of cultural materials. The Parthenon and Its Reception: From Antiquity to the Present CLASS-UA 150 Identical to ARTH-UA 150. Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 4 points. This colloquium traces the history of the Parthenon and its reception through its transformations from the temple of Athena, to Christian church, to mosque, to ruin, to icon of Western art and culture. The landscape, topography, and topology of the Athenian Acropolis are examined with an eye toward understanding the interrelation of place, myth, cult, and ritual. The architectural phases of the Parthenon, its program of sculptural decoration, its relationship to other monuments on the Acropolis, and the foundation myths that lie behind its meaning are scrutinized. Issues of reception, projection, and appropriation are considered, as well as interventions through conservation and reconstruction. Efforts to secure the repatriation of the Parthenon sculptures are reviewed within the broader context of global cultural heritage law and the opening of the New Acropolis Museum. Introduction to Classical Archaeology: Constructions of the Greek and Roman Past CLASS-UA 305 Offered periodically. 4 points. An introduction to the archaeology of the Mediterranean world, examining the history and contexts of sites and monuments, as well as the methods, practices, and research models through which they have been excavated and studied. From Bronze Age palaces of the Aegean, to the Athenian Acropolis, to the cities of Alexander the Great, the Roman forum, Pompeii, and the Roman provinces, we consider the ways in which art, archaeology, architecture, everyday objects, landscape, urbanism, technology, and ritual teach us about ancient Greek and Roman societies. Special focus is placed on reception, the origins of archaeology in the Renaissance, 19th- to 20th-century humanistic and social scientific approaches, and postmodern social constructions of knowledge. Ancient Art CLASS-UA 310 Identical to ARTH-UA 3. Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the arts of Egypt, Near East, Greece, and Rome within the contexts and diversities of their cultures. Special emphasis is placed on form, function, and style and on the significance of this material for later periods within the history of art.

This seminar explores the history and culture of Egypt's western oases, especially of Dakhleh Oasis. In the course of this month, as we travel physically around Dakhleh and Kharga and chronologically from deep prehistory to the advent of Christianity, we address issues of insularity and connectivity with respect to the Nile Valley, as well as the relationship between humans, technology, and the natural environment. Inhabitants of the oases always enjoyed a rather precarious existence, because of the difficulty of travel, the ever-present risk of salinization, hostile desert raiders, and general remoteness; thus, we are alerted to the ways in which the realities of living on an oasis provoked identifiable and to some degree recurrent cultural dynamics. The Archaeology of Egypt's Nile Valley CLASS-UA 9356 Prerequisites: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355) and Field Work in Egypt (CLASS-UA 9357). Offered in the spring. 4 points. In this traveling seminar, students leave Dakhleh Oasis for the Nile Valley to place what they have studied into a wider cultural context. During the course of the month, students visit temples, tombs, settlements, and other sites throughout Egypt, from Aswan to Alexandria. Seminar sessions and class presentations focus on themes related especially to Egypt's ever-evolving religious and funerary beliefs, as well as the complex, often multicultural, nature of Egyptian civic life at various periods. Field Work in Egypt CLASS-UA 9357 Prerequisite: The Oases of Egypt (CLASS-UA 9355). Offered in the spring. 4 points. This intensive course is largely field-based, with additional time spent processing, recording, and analyzing materials at the excavation house. Students are involved in almost every aspect of the archaeological field process. Specialists offer instruction in survey techniques, in the drafting of archaeological plans, and in the interpretation of ceramics and other highly indicative artifacts. As the bulk of excavation in Egypt is undertaken by local workmen, students receive training as a site supervisor (with all of the necessary background in archaeological methodology that this entails). Independent Project: Excavation at Amheida CLASS-UA 9358 Prerequisite: participation in the NYU Archaeology and History in Egypt program. Offered in the spring. 4 points. For this independent project, students produce original research on some aspect of the material culture so far unearthed at Amheida. Students may choose to specialize in a type of artifact (such as pottery, flints, or coins), choose to analyze specific contexts in depth, or develop a specific project based on their own interests and backgrounds. In all cases, they are encouraged to formulate and test hypotheses. Once completed, independent projects are archived in the library for the use of all other archaeologists who work at Amheida. Research undertaken while at Dakhleh is facilitated by our online database, by collections stored on site, and by the dig house library.

What is the origin of the universe? How  did the elements form? Where do stars and planets come from? How did  life on Earth originate? How did intelligence develop and human beings  come to exist? Are we alone in the cosmos? Topics include the big bang  theory of the creation of the universe and the formation of elements  during stellar evolution; the constituents of the universe, from the  large-scale realm of the galaxies to exotic objects such as neutron  stars and black holes; the evolution of life and intelligence in the  context of the sometimes catastrophic geologic history of our planet;  and the possibilities for intelligent life in the cosmos.                FALL 2004  V55.0203 Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment                   Prof. H. Brenner (Chemistry) syllabus   Uses the principles of chemistry to analyze the environmental  implications of energy usage and policy decisions concerning energy and  the environment.

FALL 2004  V55.0204 Natural Science I: Einstein's Universe                   Prof. Adler (MAP) syllabus   Addresses the science and life of Einstein in the context of  20th-century physics, beginning with 19th-century ideas about light,  space, and time in order to understand why Einstein's work was so  innovative. Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his  theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space  and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to  gravitation. Both these theories are explored quantitatively, together  with wide-ranging applications of these ideas, from the nuclear energy  which powers the sun to black holes and the big bang theory of the  birth of the universe.                FALL 2004  V55.0205 Natural Science I: Exploration of Light and Color                   Prof. Sleator (Physics) syllabus   Color science is an interdisciplinary endeavor that incorporates both  the physics and the perception of light and color. It provides an  understanding of visual effects that dramatically enhances our  appreciation of what we see. The study of color, light, and optics has  applications to photography, art, natural phenomena, and technology. We  also study the eye as both an optical and an image processing  instrument. Topics include how color is classified and measured  (colorimetry), how light is produced, how atoms and molecules affect  light, how the human retina detects light, and how lenses are used in  cameras.                FALL 2004  V55.0206 Natural Science I: From Plato to Pluto                        Prof. Schucking (Physics) syllabus   Begins with the basic phenomena of astronomy: the earth and sky, the  motions of stars, sun, moon, and planets. After this introduction  considers the historical development of astronomy from antiquity to the  17th century. Concludes with the space-age exploration of the solar  system. Laboratory exercises help to familiarize students with basic  astronomical concepts.                FALL 2004  V55.0208 Natural Science I: The Human Body - The Ultimate Machine                   Prof. Walker (NYU School of Medicine) syllabus   Highlights the role of mechanical principles in explaining the function  and maintenance of the human body, and the application of biomedical  engineering in devising treatments when body parts or functions fail  mechanically or biologically. From an engineering point of view, the  capabilities of the human body, are truly remarkable. The  musculoskeletal system enables the body to perform myriad movements and  functions. The cardiovascular and pulmonary systems are marvels of  fluid mechanics and transport. The various senses act as inputs to  discern and act on the external environment. The neurological system  provides the control for all activities and functions. From a  structural point of view, the human body develops and maintains itself  by the action of mechanical stimuli on complex biological systems. For  example, stresses and motions caused by body movements lead to cyclic  deformations in the cells within the tissues, producing new tissue and  activating reparative processes; and this concept applies to many other  systems in the body. Eventually some of the structures break down, a  situation for which the field of bioengineering has produced treatments  including artificial parts and organs, augments, transplants, grafts,  tissue engineered parts, and external functional aids. Supporting  topics include design methodology and guidelines on carrying out,  documenting, and presenting research. Guest speakers will present their  specialties in related areas. Student participation and continuing  assessment is emphasized.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0202 Natural Science I: The Cosmos and the Earth          Prof. Adler (MAP) syllabus (section 001), syllabus (section 010)   Modern scientific findings relating to major questions about the  universe and our place in it. What is the origin of the universe? How  did the elements form? Where do stars and planets come from? How did  life on Earth originate? How did intelligence develop and human beings  come to exist? Are we alone in the cosmos? Topics include the big bang  theory of the creation of the universe and the formation of elements  during stellar evolution; the constituents of the universe, from the  large-scale realm of the galaxies to exotic objects such as neutron  stars and black holes; the evolution of life and intelligence in the  context of the sometimes catastrophic geologic history of our planet;  and the possibilities for intelligent life in the cosmos.                SPRING 2005 V55.0203 Natural Science I: Energy and the Environment (with Service Learning Option)      Prof. Jordan (MAP) syllabus   Uses the principles of chemistry to analyze the environmental  implications of energy usage and policy decisions concerning energy and  the environment. Topics include the atmosphere, ozone and its  depletion, greenhouse gases, and acid rain. Case studies from the New  York City environment, such as the Hudson River, are used to focus  discussions. Finally, questions about the basis of our need for energy,  fossil fuels and their supplies, and the available alternatives are  discussed.           Note : Offered in conjunction with an optional 2-point service-learning workshop.                SPRING 2005 V55.0204 Natural Science I: Einstein's Universe          Prof. Kent (Physics) syllabus   Addresses the science and life of Einstein in the context of  20th-century physics, beginning with 19th-century ideas about light,  space, and time in order to understand why Einstein's work was so  innovative. Einstein's most influential ideas are contained in his  theories of special relativity, which reformulated conceptions of space  and time, and general relativity, which extended these ideas to  gravitation.

SPRING 2005 V55.0207 Natural Science I: Systems of the Human Body          Prof. Brandt (Physics) syllabus   Develops the physics necessary to understanding the various  interrelated systems operating within the human body. The  skeletal-muscle system converts muscle contraction into human motion  (the science of biomechanics is relevant here). The cardiovascular  system transports blood throughout the body, carrying oxygen to the  site of muscle contractions and removing carbon dioxide and heat (fluid  dynamics). The consumed oxygen is converted into work and heat, and the  rate of oxygen consumption varies with speed in walking, running, etc.  (thermodynamics). The nervous system transports electrical signals from  the sensory perceptors to the brain and from there to the muscles;  these signals determine human reaction time, coordination, and optimal  strategies for human performance (electrodynamics and optimal control  theory). All of these systems, working together, make possible human  motion and thought.           top of page      Natural Science II           The  prerequisite for all Natural Science II courses is completion of or  exemption from Quantitative Reasoning, or completion of an approved  substitute course. The completion of Natural Science I is recommended  prior to taking Natural Science II.                 FALL 2004 V55.0303 Natural Science II: Human Genetics                   Prof. Small (Biology) syllabus   We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the  ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain  unprecedented insights into the role of heredity. Beginning with an  overview of the principles of inheritance, such as cell division and  Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern  human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new  discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how  genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene  function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science  and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as  genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and  the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse  methods that scientists employ to study heredity.                FALL 2004  V55.0306 Natural Science II: Brain and Behavior                   Prof. Glimcher (Neural Science) syllabus   The relationship of the brain to behavior, beginning with the basic  elements that make up the nervous system and how electrical and  chemical signals in the brain work to effect behavior. Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.           Note : Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.                FALL 2004  V55.0309 Natural Science II: The Body - How it Works                   Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   The human body is a complex system of mutually interdependent  molecules, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems. We examine the  human body with the goal of understanding how physiological systems  operate at these varying levels. Examples include the circulation of  blood, the function of our muscles, the utilization of oxygen in  respiration, and how our immune system detects and fights foreign  invaders. Disturbing the delicate balance of these systems can produce  various human diseases, which will also be examined throughout the  course. Laboratory work provides firsthand experience with studying  molecular processes, cell structures, and physiological systems.                FALL 2004  V55.0310 Natural Science II: The Molecules of Life                   Prof. Jordan (MAP) syllabus   Our lives are increasingly influenced by the availability of new  pharmaceuticals, ranging from drugs that lower cholesterol to those  that influence behavior. We examine the chemistry and biology of  biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical  to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional  structure that endows them with a specific function. This information  provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new  drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding,  molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure  and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the  varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to  facilitate biochemical reactions. We conclude with a study of molecular  genetics and how recent information from the Human Genome Project is  stimulating new approaches to diagnosing disease and designing drug  treatments.                FALL 2004  V55.0311 Natural Science II: Lessons from the Biosphere                   Prof. Volk (Biology) syllabus   Provides a foundation of knowledge about how Earth's biosphere works.  This includes the biggest ideas and findings about biology on the  global scale-the scale in which we live. Such knowledge is especially  crucial today because we humans are perturbing so many systems within  the biosphere. We explore four main topics: (1) Evolution of Life: How  did life come to be what it is today? (2) Life's Diversity: What is  life today on the global scale? (3) Cycles of Matter: How do life and  the non-living environment interact? (4) The Human Guild: How are  humans changing the biosphere and how might we consider our future  within the biosphere? Laboratory experiments are complemented by an  exploration at the American Museum of Natural History.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0303 Natural Science II: Human Genetics          Prof. Goldberg (Chemistry) syllabus   We are currently witnessing a revolution in human genetics, where the  ability to scrutinize and manipulate DNA has allowed scientists to gain  unprecedented insights into the role of heredity. Beginning with an  overview of the principles of inheritance, such as cell division and  Mendelian genetics, we explore the foundations and frontiers of modern  human genetics, with an emphasis on understanding and evaluating new  discoveries. Descending to the molecular level, we investigate how  genetic information is encoded in DNA and how mutations affect gene  function. These molecular foundations are used to explore the science  and social impact of genetic technology, including topics such as  genetic testing, genetically modified foods, DNA fingerprinting, and  the Human Genome Project. Laboratory projects emphasize the diverse  methods that scientists employ to study heredity.

This interdisciplinary study synthesizes research from a number of  different areas of science. Topics include reconstructing evolutionary  relationships using molecular and morphological data, the mitochondrial  Eve hypothesis, ancient DNA, human variation and natural selection, the  use of stable isotopes to reconstruct dietary behavior in prehistoric  humans, solving a 2,000-year-old murder mystery, the importance of  studies of chimpanzees for understanding human behavior, and the  4-million-year-old fossil evidence for human evolution.

Using this  foundation, we examine how the brain learns and how it creates new  behaviors, together with the brain mechanisms that are involved in  sensory experience, movement, hunger and thirst, sexual behaviors, the  experience of emotions, perception and cognition, memory and the  brain's plasticity. Other key topics include whether certain behavioral  disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can be accounted for  by changes in the function of the brain, and how drugs can alter  behavior and brain function.           Note : Handling of animals and animal brain tissue is required in some labs.

We examine the chemistry and biology of  biomolecules that make up the molecular machinery of the cell. Critical  to the function of such biomolecules is their three-dimensional  structure that endows them with a specific function. This information  provides the scientific basis for understanding drug action and how new  drugs are designed. Beginning with the principles of chemical bonding,  molecular structure, and acid-base properties that govern the structure  and function of biomolecules, we apply these principles to study the  varieties of protein architecture and how proteins serve as enzymes to  facilitate biochemical reactions.

SPRING 2005 V55.0312 Natural Science II: Earth, Life, and Time          Prof. Rampino (Biology) syllabus   Over the last four billion years, life on Earth has evolved in response  to changes in the environment. At the same time, major innovations in  the history of life have led to transformations of the Earth's physical  environment. We examine the history of the intimate relationship  between the Earth's changing environment and the evolution of life on  the planet. This long-term historical perspective provides a context  for understanding current environmental issues such as global warming,  tropical deforestation, and loss of biodiversity.           top of page      Conversations of the West                 FALL 2004 V55.0400 Conversations of the West: Topics in Antiquity and Modernity - Science, Literature, and the Imagination               Prof. Freccero (Italian) syllabus   In modernity, the development of scientific investigation has  accustomed us to thinking of literature and science as widely divergent  activities, despite instances in which they may be said to have arisen  from common sources in the imagination of the West. While scientific  activity is commonly defined in terms of experimentation and  mathematical analysis, there is a creative dimension of science which  is logically prior to these institutional activities. We are thus not  concerned with the \"influence\" of science on literature, or vice-versa,  but rather with examining the imaginative themes which writers and  scientists have in common in three revolutionary moments in the history  of the West. The first is the Copernican revolution in the early  sixteenth century, the second is what has been called the  \"Machiavellian moment,\" at about the same time. The last, one that is  still with us, is the Darwinian revolution of the nineteenth century.  Like all revolutions, however, these had their antecedents and their  posterity, extending back to antiquity and forward to our own time.  Readings: Genesis, Lucretius' On the Nature of Things, Augustine's  Confessions, Dante's Inferno and Paradiso, Italo Svevo's Confessions of  Zeno, Galileo's Starry Messenger, Darwin's Origin of Species, George  Eliot's Middlemarch, Machiavelli's Prince, Shakespeare's Richard III,  Nicholas of Cusa's Learned Ignorance, Pico's Dignity of Man, Pope's  Essay on Man, Giordano Bruno's Ash Wednesday Supper, Gramsci's The  Modern Prince, selections from Plato, Ovid, John Donne.                FALL 2004  V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages               Prof. Ivry (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   God and/or Nature: Canonical and foundational texts in the Western  tradition that explain the world in religious and/or naturalistic  terms. The readings show that both perspectives are employed in most  works, a dialectical interplay ensuing between and within different  authors. Themes to be discussed include myths of origin and divinity,  happiness and the nature of the good, and eschatological visions.  Readings include selections from Hebrew and Christian scriptures and  the Quran, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Avicenna,  Maimonides, and Dante.                FALL 2004  V55.0401 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Middle Ages               Prof. Momma (English) syllabus   How has the world been presented and how have men and women who occupy  that space defined themselves through their relation to higher beings,  beasts, monsters, and, also, each other? Students will be encouraged to  discuss how modern concepts of humankind owe to, or depart from,  premodern learning and imaginations. Readings from Hebrew and Christian  scriptures, Plato, Greek tragedy, ancient epic, Beowulf, Laxdaela Saga,  Cervantes' Don Quixote; selections from the Arthurian poems by Chr\u00e9tien  de Troyes, Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Dante's Divine Comedy.                FALL 2004  V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance               Prof. Javitch (Comparative Literature) syllabus   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1 Corinthians; Homer's Odyssey;  Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; selections from  Ovid's Metamorphoses; Augustine's Confessions; Erasmus's Praise of  Folly; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince;  Montaigne's \"Apology for Raymond Sebond\"; Shakespeare's Henry IV, Part  I . After reading these works with care, and considering them in their  particular historical contexts, as we move from Greece to Rome, from  Hebrew and pagan culture to Christianity, and then to Renaissance  Europe, we will examine how these works imitate, modify, or challenge  their predecessors (e.g., the Aeneid and the Odyssey, the Confessions  and Greco-Roman ethics, Praise of Folly and 1 Corinthians; the Book of  the Courtier and the Symposium), and, also, how Renaissance authors  appropriate the thought and writings of antiquity to forge their own  modern views of the world.                FALL 2004  V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance               Prof. Low (English) syllabus   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Homer's Odyssey;  Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's  Apology and Symposium; Pico's Dignity of Man; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Milton's Paradise Lost. To understand  each of these works in its own terms, we set them against the history  and culture of their times. As we proceed, we find that the  civilizations of Athens, Rome, and Jerusalem contribute to a dialogue,  in which certain important themes appear and reappear, change, develop,  and sometimes reverse themselves. Over the millennia these  representative works have powerfully influenced their successors and  constitute a self-renewing tradition.

FALL 2004  V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment               Prof. Connolly (Classics) syllabus   \"Know yourself\" was the phrase inscribed over the entrance to the  temple of Apollo at Delphi. How did the ancient Greeks and Romans come  to know themselves and those around them\u2014as mortal men and women,  civilized or barbarian, slaves to fate or masters of their destinies,  naturally virtuous or vicious\u2014and how did Enlightenment thinkers rework  classical thought about the self? We trace the arguments of historians,  philosophers, poets, and priests in defense of their chosen paths to  self-knowledge: memory, imagination, reason, passion, taste, and  religious devotion. We ask: how do the communities we create (family,  nation, race) affect individual identity? Must we understand the past  to make sense of the present? How do philosophical ideals and literary  inventions relate to practical ideas about the truly well-lived life?  What about the unpredictable effects of love, the irrational, the  unknown, and luck? Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Acts, Romans; Euripides'  Bacchae; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Symposium; Thucydides'  Peloponnesian War; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Kant's  \"What is Enlightenment?\", \"Perpetual Peace\", \"Idea for a Universal  History\"; Rousseau's Social Contract; Wollstonecraft's Vindication of  the Rights of Women; Shelley's Frankenstein.

Topics include: conceptions of human nature, foundations of  human society, the place of law, the notion of covenant, the sources  and nature of political authority, individuals' rights and duties.  Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Romans; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's  Republic; Aristotle's Politics; Hobbes' Leviathan; Locke's Second  Treatise on Government; Rousseau's Discourse on the Origins of  Inequality.

The works we study continue to shape the way people  understand themselves and the world. We situate them in historical  context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes  introduced by earlier ones. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, 1  Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus; Plato's Apology and Crito; Aristotle's  Nicomachean Ethics; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions;  Shelley's Frankenstein; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On  Liberty; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and  Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic  and the Spirit of Capitalism; and Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.

FALL 2004  V55.0404 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the 19th Century               Prof. Ulfers (German) syllabus   A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the  dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical  progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and  society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the  former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught.  Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and  Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and  Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's  Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in  Venice.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Gilman (English) syllabus   The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the  \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it  also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece  and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of  crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the  \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at  antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture  between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant  with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's  Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke,  Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the  Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's  Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest.                SPRING 2005 V55.0402 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Renaissance      Prof. Klein (General Studies) syllabus   Argument, Violence, and Agreement in the Social Thought. Do people  assemble into tribes, city-states, principalities, nations, churches,  etc., out of fear of violence or because of some innate sociable urge?  Do they come to agreement through reason or does their \"reason\" mask  unconscious or unacknowledged capitulation to brute natural forces? Can  thinking about the nature of our reason and discourse lead us beyond  the circle of nature, or is such philosophizing simply more idealistic  covering up of the ugly predicament of humankind? Using a few trenchant  models from contemporary social theory as background, we will examine  some Western thinkers' explorations of these questions, at the same  time asking how a thinker's own civilization (with its own forms of  violence, subjugation, peace, and beauty) shapes his contribution to  the ongoing discussion. In our case this will involve examining the  very idea of \"The Renaissance\" as a rebirth of classical civilization;  and we will ask: Why \"his\" civilization? What was \"she\" doing while he  was writing? Authors: Plato, Thucydides, Epicurus, Aristotle, Tacitus,  Plutarch, Machiavelli, More, Shakespeare, Hobbes.                SPRING 2005 V55.0403 Conversations of the West: Antiquity and the Enlightenment      Prof. Goldwyn (French) syllabus   Focuses on voyage, discovery, errantry, and exile in key ancient and  Enlightenment texts and how these stories transformed and shaped  understanding of the world, the \"other,\" and the self. We examine the  way the Enlightenment thinkers revisited, reinterpreted, redefined,  and, at times, rejected their intellectual and cultural legacy.  Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, and Acts; Euripides' Medea;  Plato's Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Voltaire's Candide; Diderot's Supplement to the  Voyage of Bougainville; and Graffigny's Letters from a Peruvian Woman.

What roles does the imagination play  in religion, philosophy, and literature? What does it mean to \"imagine\"  for the writers of Hebrew scripture, for Plato, or for Descartes, Hume,  or Jane Austen? What are the limits of imagination, and what do those  limits tell us? How does imagining relate to thinking, desiring, and  knowing? Readings: Genesis, Job, Revelation; Homer's Odyssey; Plato's  Symposium and Phaedrus; Vergil's Aeneid; Augustine's Confessions;  Descartes' Meditations; Hume's Treatise of Human Nature; Swift's  Gulliver's Travels; Austen's Northanger Abbey.

Since these texts also happen to be inescapably difficult  and complex, this course offers no reassuring thematic overviews,  dumbed-down summaries of historical contexts, or hip nods to  contemporary popular culture. What it offers instead is an opportunity  to become more practiced in the pleasures and pains of aesthetic  experience, in the rational canons of moral and political argument, and  in what used to be characterized as the proper use of one's solitude,  that is, examining what it means to be a human being faced with death,  orperhaps even worse, faced with eternal life.

An \"Islamic society\" is here understood as one that shares, either as  operative present or as historical past, that common religious base  called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or  observances but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature  historical, topical, and regional. Here our particular focus is on the  society of Shi'i Muslims. Shi'ism has been neglected in the last 200  years of the Western study of Islam, and only since the 1978-79 Islamic  Revolution in Iran has it received attention in the West. Now, with  American forces in Iraq, Shi'ism is suddenly one of the main topics of  interest for the news media. The Shi'is of Iraq are the majority\u2014some  60%\u2014of the population, but historically they have been deprived of  power in the government and of access to the political and economic  life of the country.

Topics include: problems  in the interpretation of African literature and history, gender issues,  the question of whether African thought and values constitute a unique  system of thinking, the impact of the slave trade and colonialism on  African societies and culture, and the difficulties of and means for  translating and interpreting the system of thought and behavior in an  African traditional society into terms meaningful to Westerners. Among  the readings are novels, current philosophical theory, and feminist  interpretations of black and white accounts of African societies.                FALL 2004  V55.0507 World Cultures: Japan      Prof. Yoshimoto (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Examines Japanese society since the end of World War II through a study  of popular culture. Topics include: war and its aftermath, nuclear  apocalypse, the Cold War and economic recovery, consumer culture,  gender and sexuality, technology and utopianism/dystopianism, and  nostalgia for the past. The primary texts to be looked at are Japanese  animation or so-called anime. Writings on popular culture, books and  essays on history, novels and short stories, and other audio-visual  materials are used to develop critical skills in cultural analysis and  to reflect on what is or is not lost in translation of Japanese  animation.                FALL 2004  V55.0512 World Cultures: China      Prof. Guthrie (Sociology) syllabus   The most populous nation on earth, China plays a crucial role in the  world economy. An understanding of China's place in the world must  begin with its modern history\u2014from the Qing Dynasty and the Western  encroachment to the recent economic reforms of the People's Republic.  Structured not as a historical chronology, but as a sampling of  approaches to Chinese society from various analytical perspectives, the  course considers some of the major events, issues, and themes that have  shaped modern Chinese society, focusing on the period from the Opium  War to the present. Through various social-scientific lenses, we  examine issues of war, political upheaval and crisis, social movements,  the structure of communist society, and economic reform.                FALL 2004  V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel      Prof. Kawashima (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   Examines various aspects of the \"culture\" of ancient Israel from its  origins up to the Babylonian Exile (587 B.C.E.) through a close reading  and analysis of large portions of the Hebrew Bible. Focuses in  particular on Israelite religion, not just as a set of beliefs and  practices, but as a way of understanding gods, humans, the world, and  the relations among them. Topics include: myth, ritual, sacrifice, law,  and the sacred. Our method is comparative, drawing on mythic and epic  traditions of Mesopotamia, Ugarit, and Greece, in order to bring the  peculiar nature of the Hebrew Bible and biblical religion into better  focus. We address the conceptual divide between so-called \"pagan\"  religions and, for lack of a better term, the \"monotheistic\" religion  of ancient Israel. The point is not to judge the relative merits of  these two different religious systems, but to recognize and understand  their differences. Questions of historical background and literary form  (myth, epic, history) will also be taken into account.

Studies the dynamics  of the colonial encounter, focusing on such themes as indigenous  responses to European rule, the formation of \"Indian\" society, and the  interaction of Europeans, Africans, and indigenous people. Considers  postcolonial Latin America, focusing on themes such as political  culture, competing ideologies of economics and social development, and  the construction of collective identities based on region, race,  ethnicity, gender, and class. Readings consist mostly of primary  sources and allow us to hear diverse voices within Latin American  society, including works by European conquerors, Inca and Aztec  descendants in the colonial period, and African and creole slaves.  Course materials also include novels, short stories, films,  photographs, and music.                FALL 2004  V55.0516 World Cultures: India      Prof. Goswami (History) syllabus   Introduces students to the society, culture, and economy of modern  India, from the foundation of British colonial rule in the late 18th  century to the nationalist struggle in the early 20th century, through  the lens of broader issues in historical and cultural inquiry. Examines  shifts in society and culture during the modern period from different  perspectives: British colonial agents, religious groups, the middle and  educated classes, women and peasants, and the many-faceted struggle for  independence before and during the period of Gandhi. Secondary sources  are read in conjunction with primary sources (political treatises,  novels, and film) that speak to the more general issues at hand:  colonial domination, the relationship between cultural and economic  shifts, political identities and nationalism, and collective memory and  violence.                FALL 2004  V55.0523 World Cultures: Islam in Asia      Prof. McChesney (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   More Muslims live today in Central and South Asia than in the entire  Middle East. We consider the spread of the religion of Islam from the  Middle East, the nature of the ensuing dialogue between Muslimsand  adherents of existing religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, shamanism), and  the politics of Islam today in the Central Asian countries of the  former Soviet Union, and in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and  Bangladesh. The focus is on the nature of the dialogue and conflict  between the adherents of Islam and those of other religious traditions,  in order to clarify the economic and social issues behind conflicts  waged in the name of religion. Readings and films will make use of  indigenous materials and their representations of Islam in those  regions both historically and today.                FALL 2004  V55.0534 World Cultures: The Black Atlantic      Prof. Fischer (Spanish &amp; Portuguese) syllabus   The cultures of the African diaspora that resulted from the Atlantic  slave trade and the struggle against it, focusing on the political and  expressive cultures of the Black Atlantic, and asking how issues  concerning racial slavery, racial subordination, and racial liberation  affected the formation of national cultures from Enlightenment Europe  to the 20th century Caribbean and the United States. Special attention  will be paid to the Haitian Revolution (1791\u20131804), the only successful  slave revolution in Western history. Readings in the historiography of  the Atlantic of the slavery and post-slavery period will be  supplemented by readings in political philosophy, anthropology, and  literature, as well as film screenings.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0502 World Cultures: Islamic Societies      Prof. Ben-Dor (History) syllabus   Islamic culture\u2014from Spain to China, and from pre-Islamic times to the  late Ottoman period\u2014viewed through written texts, as well as music,  visual arts, and films. Topics include: poetry, the Quran, hadith,  fiction, travel and adventure literature, philosophy, law, polemical  writing, geography and historiography, science, and love. Each theme,  literary genre, or topic is examined through several examples drawn  from varying contexts and periods. While the approach is not strictly  chronological, particular attention is paid to the historical context  giving rise to the materials under consideration.                SPRING 2005 V55.0511 World Cultures: Middle Eastern Societies      Prof. Fahmy (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies) syllabus   The histories, societies, and cultures of \"the Middle East\"\u2014a  relatively recent name for a very diverse region of western Asia and  northern Africa. Focusing on the period from the heyday of Ottoman  power in Europe and the Middle East in the sixteenth century until the  present, we use a range of materials, including translated texts,  novels and short stories, films and videos, and photographs, to explore  changing forms of individual and collective identity, patterns of  social life, and modes of government. We pay special attention to how  people in the region experienced and grappled with the profound  transformations their societies underwent from the eighteenth century  onward, especially the expansion of European economic, political, and  cultural power; colonial rule; and the rise of new nation-states. We  conclude by discussing the Middle East today and some of the issues its  peoples face.                SPRING 2005 V55.0514 World Cultures: Ancient Israel      Prof. Schiffman (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies) syllabus   The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times and  the second Temple period and the emergence of classical Judaism,  covering the period from c. 1400 B.C.E. to the third century C.E.  Topics include the achievements of these societies in law and social  organization, prophetic movements, history of Israelite religion and  early Judaism, and ancient Hebrew and Jewish literature. The Hebrew  Bible and Rabbinic literature preserve much of the creativity of  ancient Israel; and archaeological excavations in Israel and  neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in  Hebrew and related languages have added to our knowledge. In addition,  new discoveries in the Dead Sea Scrolls contribute greatly to our  understanding of the history of Judaism and the emergence of  Christianity. Of particular interest is the early development of  Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the  mother religion of Christianity and Islam.                SPRING 2005 V55.0515 World Cultures: Latin America      Prof. Himpele (Anthropology) syllabus   Explores the cultural, social, and political organization of indigenous  people before the period of European colonization.

SPRING 2005 V55.0516 World Cultures: India      Prof. Rajagopal (Culture &amp; Communication) syllabus   By examining representations of the Indian diaspora in the United  States, the United Kingdom, and the Caribbean, we see that a fixed idea  of \"India\" is misleading in the effort to understand its changing  manifestations. We investigate the ways in which colonialism reshaped  indigenous society, as well as the currents of religious, cultural, and  political change that developed in the process, leading to Indian  nationalism and its contemporary variations.

Cohen (Russian &amp; Slavic Studies) syllabus   Major periods, developments, and interpretative issues in Russian  politics, history, and society, from the 1917 revolution to the  present. The emphasis is on the Soviet experience, though the Tsarist  past and post-Soviet developments are also considered. Special  attention is given to the role of historical traditions, leadership,  ideology, ramifying events, and socioeconomic factors.                SPRING 2005 V55.0532 World Cultures: The African Diaspora      Prof. Gomez (History) syllabus   The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time,  examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of  special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering  on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of  cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to  non-African influences.                SPRING 2005 V55.0535 World Cultures: Korea and Korean Diaspora      Prof. Park (East Asian Studies) syllabus   Modern Korean history is characterized by a volatile transformation of  the nation: the national division into South and North Koreas and their  ideologically skewed relations with Korean diasporic communities during  the Cold War period, and the economic and cultural integration of the  two Koreas and the Korean diaspora in the post-Cold War era. To  understand the origins and changing processes of Korean politics, our  study embeds Korean nation formation in geopolitics and global  capitalism, in three parts: the politics and cultures of decolonization  and the \"economic miracle\" in South Korea; political ideology and  economic crisis in North Korea; and the study of Korean-Chinese,  Korean-Japanese, and Korean-American diasporic communities, as well as  their relations with both North and South Korea.           top of page      Societies and the Social Sciences                 FALL 2004 V55.0600 Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics - Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Empires and Political Imagination      Prof. Burbank (History) &amp; Prof. Cooper (History) syllabus   Throughout history, most people have lived in empires. How have empires  inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging,  and power? Comparative study of empires from the Romans to the present  expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the  nation-state is \"natural\" and necessary. We explore historians' various  approaches to studying empires and investigate how empires were held  together\u2014and where they were weak\u2014from perspectives that focus on  political and economic connections over long distances and long time  periods. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese,  Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as  well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other  imperial polities.                FALL 2004  V55.0600 Societies and the Social Sciences: Topics - Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Human Rights and Transitional Societies      Prof. Dixon (Sociology) syllabus   Explores the development of the rule of law and human rights in  transitional societies. Particular emphasis is given to these issues in  post-Nazi Germany and post-communist Central Europe, especially the  Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and the former East Germany.  After a brief history of Czechoslovakia and the constitutionalization  of the \"velvet revolution,\" we examine the historical, domestic and  international context of human rights in transitional justice. To  understand the historical context, we discuss the debates that occurred  when emerging democracies dealt with former regimes during  de-Nazification and de-communization (public access to the files of the  former secret police, purging and screening, prosecution, statutes of  limitations). We also compare similar debates in transitional regimes  in Central America, South Africa, and Iraq. To study the domestic  contexts, we examine contemporary human rights debates as they relate  to citizenship and nationalism, freedom of the press, social and  economic rights, women's rights, and discrimination against the Roma  (gypsies). Finally, we explore the international context of human  rights by analyzing human rights and European Union membership, the  application of Western legal rights, the globalization of law, and  contradictions between \"local\" and \"global\" human rights.                FALL 2004  V55.0616 Societies and the Social Sciences: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on the Language of America's Ethnic Minorities      Prof. Singler (Linguistics) syllabus   Examines the role of language in communities in the United States,  specifically within African-American, Asian-American, Latino, and  Native American populations. Explores the relationship of language to  culture, race, and ethnicity, looking in particular for similarities  and differences across these communities. Considers the role that  language experiences play in current models of race and ethnicity.

Considers the  structure, universality, and diversity of human language. Introduces  the core areas of grammar: its sound system, the structures of words  and sentences, and meanings. Examines the representation of language in  the brain, first language acquisition, and processing. Introduces  linguistic universals, dialect, sociolects, and the mechanism of  linguistic change.

How have social scientists conceptualized law? What  social processes shape the formulation of law and its application to  particular cases? What role does law play in the functioning of  society? How is law implicated in social change? What issues arise when  law is used in efforts to overcome disadvantages associated with class,  race, sex, and sexual orientation?           top of page      Expressive Culture                 FALL 2004 V55.0720 Expressive Culture: Images      Prof. McKelway (Fine Arts)   An introduction to the visual language and functions of art from the  cultural perspective of ancient East Asia, including some  cross-cultural comparison with South Asian and European art. Strong  emphasis is given to art forms other than painting and sculpture,  including ceramics, lacquer, metalwork, and textile design, in order to  question the ways in which individuals and institutions classify and  define works of art. Students learn vocabulary to analyze and  appreciate works of art from a variety of perspectives, including  style, technology, and literary or historical context. Coincident with  a major exhibition of Chinese art at the Metropolitan Museum, \"China:  Dawn of a Golden Age,\" students explore and write about actual works on  display in New York City.                FALL 2004  V55.0722 Expressive Culture: Images - Architecture in New York Field Study      Prof. Broderick (Fine Arts) syllabus   New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for  firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban  architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts.  Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures  with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both  to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century  architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper  and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.                FALL 2004  V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Boorman (Music) syllabus   Music as Sound, Music as Communication. How does music works, what are  its elements, and how do they help it act as a communicative device? To  explore the various ways in which music has been used to communicate  different types of messages, we consider case studies of classical  music of the 18th and 19th centuries, music in Indonesia, music as a  vehicle for political messages, and new ideas about music itself.                FALL 2004  V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Cusick (Music)      Prof. Dujunco (Music) syllabus   Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We  encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons;  they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the  movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a  series of specific case studies we investigate the function and  significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic  questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and  evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical  locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural  explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time  and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.                FALL 2004  V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film      Prof. Allen (Cinema Studies) syllabus   Using the films of Alfred Hitchcock, we explore the representational  and expressive possibilities that cinema affords in the context of mass  culture, at the same time providing students with the concepts to grasp  the different ways in which films create meaning, achieve their  emotional impact, and respond in complex ways to the historical  contexts in which they are made. Hitchcock made 53 feature films in a  fifty-year career. Seeking recognition of the role of the film director  as the distinctive creative influence in the medium, he grafted  modernist strategies of visual symbolism and metaphor onto the  essentially conservative, masculine, patriotic and popular genre of the  espionage thriller. In this way he probed the idea of the formation of  the couple\u2014the sine qua non of popular narrative\u2014by connecting the  establishment of romance and social order to the problem of deciphering  the visual field and discovering truth in a world of mere appearances,  introducing a remarkable self-consciousness, as well as stylistic  sophistication, into works of mass culture.                 SPRING 2005 V55.0720 Expressive Culture: Images      Prof. Rice (Fine Arts) syllabus   What is the place of art in an image-saturated world? We begin by  considering the power and taboo of images and the ways in which  individuals and institutions that constitute \"the art world\" classify  some of these images as works of art, turn to explore the visual and  conceptual challenges presented by major works of sculpture,  architecture, and painting, and conclude with a selection of problems  raised by art today. Students develop the vocabulary to both appreciate  and question the artistic \"gestures\" of society in various places and  times.                SPRING 2005 V55.0721 Expressive Culture: Images - Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study      Prof. Broderick (Fine Arts) syllabus   New York's public art collections contain important examples of  painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as  some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art. Meets once a  week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group  excursions to the museums or other locations where these works are  exhibited.                SPRING 2005 V55.0730 Expressive Culture: Sounds      Prof. Roesner (Music) syllabus   The Arts of Music. People have not only developed modes of thought,  systems of belief, and diverse ways to organize themselves collectively  into societies and cultures; in all cultures and traditions they have  also engaged in creative activity of a more specifically aesthetic  nature\u2014they have expressed themselves through art. One of the most  potent modes of artistic expression is through music, a medium  cultivated in one way or another by every human society. We examine and  compare the nature, purposes, and social functions of three different  forms of musical expression\u2014music informed by a Platonic/Pythagorean  aesthetic, Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, and jazz to c.  1950\u2014raising fundamental issues about the nature and interpretation of  music while developing a basic formal, critical, and historical  vocabulary for discussion, and, directly and indirectly, relating this  discussion to an appraisal of the state of the arts today. While  devoting a considerable amount of attention to European art music from  the middle ages to the end of the twentieth century, and to three  repertories that are considered \"classical\" in most respects, we also  draw on the whole range of musics in the world today\u2014classical,  popular, and non-Western musics in all their diversities\u2014and students  are encouraged to introduce the music with which they themselves are  most familiar into the discussion where appropriate.                SPRING 2005 V55.0750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Shohat (Art and Public Policy) &amp; Prof. Stam (Cinema Studies) syllabus   Multiculturalism, Race, and the Media. We will discuss film and the  media in terms of racial representation and multicultural history. On  the one hand, we will look critically at the stereotyped ways in which  race, ethnicity, and national identity have been portrayed in the mass  media; on the other, we will celebrate alternative, multicultural  representations. The films presented will range from Spike Lee's Do the  Right Thing to Battle of Algiers and Hearts and Minds and Lone Star,  alongside the stand-up comedy of Chris Rock and the media-making of  Michael Moore. We will talk about multicultural issues in France,  Brazil and India as well as the U.S. Some key issues and concepts will  be: contrapuntal history, colonial discourse, ethnicities-in-relation,  third world and minority film, aesthetics of resistance. Three key  texts for the course will be: Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, Unthinking  Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media, Sven Lindquist,  Exterminate All the Brutes, and James Loewen, Lies My Teacher Taught Me.      top of page                   Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
