The program's focus is on designing and deploying rigorous and high-impact methodological informatics innovations in translational or clinical medicine. Students are accepted with backgrounds in biological, medical, or quantitative/computational disciplines. Strong applicants will have successfully completed at least one course in design and analysis of algorithms, several courses in college level mathematics and statistics, and will have strong programming skills in one or more general purpose programming languages. Prior experience in research in BMI is strongly encouraged.   The program is housed in the Center for Health Informatics and Bioinformatics (CHIBI). Students have access to its resources which include: 18 informatics faculty, a state of the art high performance computing facility, 6 informatics methods research laboratories, Best Practices Integrative Informatics Core that supports numerous consulting and collaborative science projects in the Medical Center, High-Throughput Assay informatics services that include microarrays, next-generation sequencing and proteomics. Students also have access to educational informatics resources, electronic medical record and other data for the purposes of primary and secondary research.   The program has additional 25 core faculty from the Courant Institute, Stern School of Business, School of Continuing Education, Clinical and Translational Science Institute, School of Nursing, Biomedical Library, Translational Science Program and the Office of Professional Development. An ongoing seminar series and other activities ensure continuous exposure to educational and scientific opportunities in informatics.
