Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color.

These events provide our students with insights into your corporate culture and business strategies, and offer forums for networking with alumni and other members of your team. Presentations are held throughout the week during the afternoon and evening, except on Fridays. Though several presentations may be delivered simultaneously, OCD will do its best to not schedule firms in the same industry at the same time. All presentations are promoted free of charge through the Stern Recruiting System and in the weekly career alerts to students, but additional publicity is advised.     Corporate Presentation Reservation Requests:  To assist your efforts to recruit the best talent for your firm, we invite you to reserve a Stern MBA on-campus presentation starting Monday, April 29th, 2013 through the Stern Recruiting System .     Dates :  To allow students time to acclimate to their academic commitments, recruitment at Stern will officially begin on:     September 8, 2014 for second-year students    September 29, 2014 for joint presentations    October 6, 2014 for first-year students       Corporate Presentation Quick Facts:       Corporate presentations are 90-minutes in length.    Available times are: Monday through Thursday from 12:00pm-1:30pm, 4:30pm-6:00pm and 7:00pm-8:30pm.    In most cases, company representatives can access the presentation room 30 minutes before start time.       Audio Visual Equipment  Standard audiovisual equipment is provided for all corporate presentations. To ensure that we are able to accommodate all your needs, please include your media requests on the Corporate Presentation reservation form through your Stern Recruiting System . Please note any special requirements on that form.       Company Literature/Products  Materials that you would like distributed at your corporate presentation should be sent no more than two weeks beforehand to:    New York University  Leonard N. Stern School of Business  Office of Career Development  44 West Fourth Street, Suite 5-100  New York, NY 10012  Attn: ( Relationship Manager )    We recommend that you send all products pre-packed and marked with your company name, date and type of event. Please include a self-addressed shipping label and notify your Relationship Manager of the number of boxes you are sending.       Catering  Although catering is not scheduled through OCD, we request that you use the School\u2019s preferred vendors:   Food In Motion : Lloyd Zimet (212) 766-4400   Food For Thought : Steve Sotland (212) 929-4689       Publicity  OCD promotes all events facilitated through our office in a weekly newsletter to students as well as through our Stern Recruiting System. If you would like additional publicity, we recommend the following:     Send an electronic flyer to targeted student clubs for distribution    Place an advertisement in the Stern Opportunity, the School\u2019s student newspaper. For details, e-mail opportun@stern.nyu.edu or call 212-995-4432.    Note: Please make sure to send all advertisements to your Relationship Manager for approval before submitting to either the clubs or the Opportunity. Please do not send hardcopy flyers, as Stern students do not have individual mailboxes.

Short Logo  Contemporary and versatile, the NYU short logo is central to our university-wide visual identity and is used in the majority of central administration communications.   Long Logo  The long logo is used for outside audiences where the full name adds additional information. It is also used when the communications would benefit from a more formal approach.   Stacked Logo  The stacked logo works well in small spaces and in large applications, like the flags you see on our buildings.     &gt;Download Zip (3 MB)   &gt;Logo Key and File Usage Guide PDF (395 KB)                                                Letterhead Templates   Short logo versions: New university-wide visual identity  Long logo versions: More formal traditional logo   &gt;Download Zip (170 KB)                                   Offset Printed Letterhead Available Online   Color on office printers is inconsistent and will never match the NYU Violet (PMS 2597) branding color. For best results, buy color letterhead through the online i-Buy Marketplace and then imprint the color letterhead by feeding it through the black-and-white laser printer.
