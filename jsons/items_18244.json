Textbook: Herstein's book, Topics in Algebra.       Supplementary notes: We will also occasionally use the following supplementary notes of F. P. Greenleaf.   1) Integers , 2) Groups , 3) Transformation groups ,   4) Permutation groups ,   5) Structure of groups , 6) Universal objects .      Syllabus:   Topics in Groups, Rings and Fields, chapters 2,3,5 in Herstein.   According to time  we may cover further advanced topics.     I will post here a short description of each lecture and the relevant parts of the book as the course progresses.       Homework: Homework will be assigned weekly, and posted here by the Friday of each week. Solutions must be handed in the following Friday in the beginning of the recitation.   Corrected assigments will be returned during recitations or in the office hours of your teaching assistant (either Yitzhak Kornbluth or Adam Massey). Please write the name of your teaching assistant clearly on the top of the homework that you hand in.   For fairness reasons, late homework will not be accepted, but the lowest homework grade will be dropped to compute the final grade.       Grading: The final grade will be based on homework (20%), two quizzes (20%), a midterm exam (25%) and a final exam (35%).   You are welcome to collaborate with other students on the homework, but you must indicate clearly the names of other students  you collaborated with and write your solutions separately.          Announcements       There will be no recitation on Friday, September 6. The first recitation of the semester will be on Friday, September 13.   The first quiz will be on September 30, in class.   The midterm will be on October 28, in class.   The second quiz will be on November 25, in class.   The final exam is scheduled for Monday, December 16, 8:00AM-9:50AM. See    http://www.nyu.edu/registrar/pdf/Final_exam_schedule_Fall_2013.pdf   for more information. Since the registrar's office sometimes changes the exam schedule please check this link again closer to the exam date.    Recommended reading for the recitation meeting on September 13: Greenleaf's notes on integers , pages 7-9, from section 2.1.24 to the beginning of section 2.2.    The topics of the first quiz, which will take place on September 30 in class, are homework 1, homework 2, and all the definitions and statements (theorems and lemmas)   that we covered in class up to (and including) subgroups.   The topics of the midterm exam, which will take place on October 28 in class, are all the material covered in class up to (and including) Cayley's theorem (this includes all the definitions and statements of theorems and lemmas that we covered,   as well as all of the proofs that were presented in class),   and homeworks 1 through 7. The midterm exam may also contain problems that you have not seen before in the homework or elsewhere.   The topics of the second quiz, which will take place on November 25 in class, are homeworks 7 through 11, and all the definitions and statements (theorems and lemmas)   that we covered in class from permutation groups through the definition of a quotient of a ring.   The class on Wednesday December 11 will be a review for the upcoming final exam. Please prepare questions in advance.    The material for the final exam is everything that was covered this semester up to (and including) polynomials over fields.         Homework assignments       Homework 1 . Posted September 4, due September 13 in the beginning of the recitation. Part (a) of problem 1   (the longest part of this homework assignment) can be done based on the material that was taught in the class on Wednesday, September 4.

Lecture 16 (October 30): Proof that the alternating group A n is simple when n&#8805; 5, conjugacy classes, the class equation (   Greenleaf's notes on permutation groups or http://planetmath.org/simplicityofthealternatinggroups and Herstein section 2.11).   Lecture 17 (November 4): More on the class equation, some applications of the class equation: the center of a group of order p n is   non-trival, groups of order p 2 are Abelian and the classification of groups of order p 2 , Cauchy's theorem for general groups   (section 2.11 in Hertstein).   Lecture 18 (November 6): Statements of the three Sylow theorems and an example of their application: any group of size 20449=11 2 13 2 is Abelian. Proof of Sylow's first theorem, double cosets and proof of Sylow's second theorem (section 2.12 in Herstein).    Lecture 19 (November 11): Completion of the proof of Sylow's second theorem, proof of Sylow's third theorem, classification of groups of size pq (section 2.12 in Herstein).    Lecture 20 (November 13): More on the classification of groups of size pq, additional applications of Sylow's theorems: a group of size 72 cannot be simple and any simple group of size 60 is isomorphic to A 5 . Statement of the fundamental structure theorem   for finite Abelian groups (parts of sections 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14 in Herstein).    Lecture 21 (November 18): Definition of a ring and many examples of rings. Integral domains, division rings and fields. Proof that any finite integral domain is a field   (sections 3.1 and 3.2 in Herstein).   Lecture 22 (November 20): The characteristic of an integral domain, homomorphisms of rings, ideals, quotients of rings (sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 in Herstein).   Lecture 23 (November 25): Quiz in the first part of class, the first isomorphism theorem for rings, maximal ideals (sections 3.4 and 3.5 in Herstein).   Lecture 24 (November 27): More on maximal ideals, an ideal is maximal if and only if the corresponding quotient is a field, definition of Euclidean ring,   proof that a Euclidean ring is a principal ideal domain, invertibility, divisibility and greatest common divisors in rings, existence of greatest common divisors in Euclidean rings   (sections 3.5 and 3.7 in Herstein).   Lecture 25 (December 2): Prime elements in Euclidean rings, existence and uniqueness of prime factorization in Euclidean rings. The Gaussian integers and beginning of the proof that the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean ring (sections 3.7 and 3.8 in Herstein).    Lecture 26 (December 4): Conclusion of the proof that the Gaussian integers are a Euclidean ring, proof of Fermat's sum of squares theorem. Beginning of the discussion of the ring of polynomials over a field (sections 3.8 and 3.9 in Herstein).    Lecture 27 (December 9): Proof that the ring of polynomials over a field is a Euclidean ring, irreducible polynomials, primitive polynomials, the Gauss lemma and the Eisenstein criterion (sections 3.9 and 3.10 in Herstein).   Lecture 28 (December 11): Review for the final exam."}]}]
