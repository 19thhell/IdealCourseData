Program Requirements/Advising Records       Knowing your program requirements is crucial to your success in your program. The advising record lists all program requirements; you should keep a copy handy at all times to track your progress.    Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness Registration Planner    Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness Advising Record    Course Sequencing    Foundational Courses (Please refer to your advising record) are to be taken first, in conjunction with intermediate courses, followed by advanced courses. Other requirements may be taken as they fit into student programs. Intermediate courses are each offered in the fall and spring (Group Dynamics, Cross-Cultural Counseling, Human Growth and Development, along with elective courses, are also offered in the summer).    For part-time students, the course sequence remains the same. However, part-time students need to pay special attention to pre- and co-requisites in planning their programs and should meet with the academic advisor prior to registration each semester.    Students must successfully complete the following courses before beginning the internship:    APSY-GE 2651 Professional Orientation &amp; Ethical Issues in CMHW    APSY-GE 2661 Foundations of Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness    APSY-GE 2657 Counseling: Theory and Process    APSY-GE 2658 Individual Counseling: Practice I    APSY-GE 2659 Individual Counseling: Practice II (Prereq: APSY-GE 2658)    APSY-GE 2038 Abnormal Psychology    APSY-GE 2138 Human Growth and Development    APSY-GE 2620 Group Dynamics: Theory and Practice    APSY-GE 2682 Cross-cultural Counseling    If a student plans to pursue licensure outside of New York State, it is recommended that the student research any academic and clinical requirements for a particular state in which he or she plans to work so that the student can complete appropriate coursework and fieldwork hours while at NYU.    Lab    In order to gain and strengthen counseling skills, students complete a two-course lab sequence called Individual Counseling: Practice I and II (APSY-GE 2658 and APSY-GE 2659). The counseling labs are designed to present students with an opportunity for experiential learning and practice in communication skills and counseling process. Based on a training program called Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR), the classes involve the use of training DVDs and audiovisual recording of counseling sessions to help students develop self-awareness, personal and professional insight, and basic counseling skills. APSY-GE 2658 is a prerequisite for APSY-GE 2659. Full time students are to complete these courses in the first and second semesters. Part time students should take these courses in the year prior to the start of their internship.    Grading for the lab courses is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon the circumstances. Those students in Lab I who have not acquired the necessary insight or skill level required for advancement to Lab II will be required to repeat Lab I.    Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab II will be subject to review by the counseling program faculty.    It is important to read the course information notes prior to registering for a lab course. Certain course sections are designated for school counseling students and other sections for counseling for mental health and wellness students.    Internship    Students in the CMHW program are required to meet the state licensure requirement of 600 hours (300 hours per semester or about 20 hours per week) during two consecutive semesters in an appropriate setting approved by the Internship Director. Students are supervised by a licensed mental health professional.    The internship takes place in the second or final year. To support the fieldwork, students register for and complete APSY-GE 2655 and APSY-GE 2656 (Internship in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness I and II) in the fall and spring semesters during the internship year. APSY-GE 2655 is a pre-requisite for APSY-GE 2656. Students must register for each of these courses during the semester prior to the one in which they plan to take the course. Full time students complete coursework, the internship, and internship seminar concurrently.    Grading for the internship courses is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon the circumstances.    Internship preparation workshops will be held late in the fall semester. These information sessions will be announced on the listserv. You must attend one session in order to prepare for the process involved in securing an internship placement site. You will work closely with Corinne Miller Weinman, Director of Internship and Training, during this process.    State-Mandated Requirement    All CMHW students must complete the state-mandated workshop that covers Identifying and Reporting Child Abuse prior to the start of internship. This workshop can be completed online within two hours over thirty days. Upon completion, students will be provided with an electronic certificate of completion, which must then be forwarded to the academic advisor. This is a graduation requirement; therefore, it is imperative that students provide the academic advisor with proof of completion. Students are responsible for keeping a copy for themselves, as many employers will also require proof of completion of this workshop. Students should complete this requirement during November or December of the first semester. You will receive more information from the academic advisor early in the first semester. It is not necessary (or encouraged) for you to complete the workshop at this time.    Culminating/Terminal Experience    The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) is the terminal experience for the MA counseling programs. The exam should be taken during the student&rsquo;s last semester of matriculation in the program. It is usually held during the last Friday of October and the first Friday in March. The fee for taking the CPCE is $50.00.       Course Load       Students typically register for 15 units per semester in the first year. Full time students take a minimum of 12 units per semester. Depending on semester course loads and whether they complete summer coursework, students sometimes have fewer than 12 units remaining in the final semester.    Students are encouraged to take some courses over the winter session and/or summer session in order to lighten the course load during the second year. Students typically register for 12 credits per semester during the second year, which includes the internship.    Most summer classes offered by the Department of Applied Psychology run during four three-week sessions. Students are limited to taking one course per session but may take as many as four courses over the summer, if necessary.    The winter session takes place during three weeks in January, prior to the start of the spring semester. Students are limited to taking one course per winter session. Tuition and fees for the winter session course are applied toward the spring semester . Students may register for a winter course when they register for spring classes. Students may register for a winter course when they register for spring classes.    Students who are required to take a minimum of 12 units in order to remain eligible for scholarships but who have fewer than 12 units remaining in their final semester should contact the academic advisor for instructions to avoid having the scholarship canceled.    Students who are taking 6-11 units in a semester are considered part time and still meet financial aid eligibility. If visas or other reasons require a student to be half time or full time, students may be granted equivalency. Equivalency may be granted only for the purposes of visas, student loans, student loan deferral, TAP and Veterans&rsquo; Benefits requirements. For more information about this, please review the full policy . It is important to understand that students only receive aid for the number of credits for which they are registered, regardless of equivalency status.       First Semester Coursework       Full-time students are REQUIRED to take the following courses in the first semester:    APSY-GE 2661  Foundations in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2657  Individual Counseling: Theory and Process* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2658  Individual Counseling: Practice I* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2138  Human Growth and Development       Full-time students should choose ONE of the following additional courses for their first semester:    APSY-GE 2038  Abnormal Psychology* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2138  Human Growth and Development* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2634  Dynamics of Vocational Development 3 credits    APSY-GE 2620  Group Dynamics* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2682  Cross Cultural Counseling* 3 credits    Applied Content Area Elective/Special Population Course** 3 credits       Part time students typically take 6-9 credits per semester. Part time students should begin with a combination of two classes from the following list:    APSY-GE 2651 Professional Orientation and Ethical Issues in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness (strongly recommended)    APSY-GE 2661 Foundations in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness (strongly recommended)    APSY-GE 2138 Human Growth and Development    APSY-GE 2657 Individual Counseling: Theory and Process    Part time students should NOT take APSY-GE 2658/9 Individual Counseling: Practice I/II until the year prior to their internship.    *Course must be successfully completed prior to internship. APSY-GE 2038, APSY-GE 2138, APSY-GE 2634, APSY-GE 2620, and APSY-GE 2682 will be offered in the spring semester as well. APSY-GE 2138, APSY-GE 2620, and APSY-GE 2682 will also be offered over the summer.    **Students may elect to take an applied content area or special population course in the first semester if they know what specific area in which they would like to intern. Students choosing to take an elective should consult with the academic advisor.    Students should complete the Identification and Reporting Suspected Child Abuse 0 credit online workshop during the first semester (in November/December). The academic advisor will send out information about this in September.    The following sections of APSY-GE 2658 are specifically for SCHOOL COUNSELING students: 004. 005, 008, and 012. Please be sure you do not register for one of these sections of Practice I.       Faculty Mentors       At the beginning of the Fall semester, students will have the opportunity to select on a first-come, first serve basis a faculty mentor in the counseling programs. Students should choose their mentor based on shared interests.    All students are required to select a faculty mentor. Selection will take place via online survey. The role of the faculty mentor is to provide academic and professional guidance. Faculty mentors are available to answer general curriculum related questions (e.g., &ldquo;I am interested in XYZ, what courses will match my interests?&rdquo;), provide guidance to students looking to join a research team, provide support to students who plan to apply to PhD programs, and assist in remediation process, if necessary.       Research       While not required, many students choose to participate on research teams with faculty. Depending on the needs of the team, students may spend anywhere from 5-20 hours a week on research (in most cases, these positions are unpaid). At the welcome reception on the first day of classes, students will have an opportunity to hear from faculty about their research and whether they have space on their teams for new students.        Don't forget to complete the survey so that you can be cleared to register!

Program Requirements/Advising Records       Knowing your program requirements is crucial to your success in your program. The advising record lists all program requirements; you should keep a copy handy at all times to track your progress.    Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness Registration Planner    Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness Advising Record    Course Sequencing    Foundational Courses (Please refer to your advising record) are to be taken first, in conjunction with intermediate courses, followed by advanced courses. Other requirements may be taken as they fit into student programs. Intermediate courses are each offered in the fall and spring (Group Dynamics, Cross-Cultural Counseling, Human Growth and Development, along with elective courses, are also offered in the summer).    For part-time students, the course sequence remains the same. However, part-time students need to pay special attention to pre- and co-requisites in planning their programs and should meet with the academic advisor prior to registration each semester.    Students must successfully complete the following courses before beginning the internship:    APSY-GE 2651 Professional Orientation &amp; Ethical Issues in CMHW    APSY-GE 2661 Foundations of Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness    APSY-GE 2657 Counseling: Theory and Process    APSY-GE 2658 Individual Counseling: Practice I    APSY-GE 2659 Individual Counseling: Practice II (Prereq: APSY-GE 2658)    APSY-GE 2038 Abnormal Psychology    APSY-GE 2138 Human Growth and Development    APSY-GE 2620 Group Dynamics: Theory and Practice    APSY-GE 2682 Cross-cultural Counseling    If a student plans to pursue licensure outside of New York State, it is recommended that the student research any academic and clinical requirements for a particular state in which he or she plans to work so that the student can complete appropriate coursework and fieldwork hours while at NYU.    Lab    In order to gain and strengthen counseling skills, students complete a two-course lab sequence called Individual Counseling: Practice I and II (APSY-GE 2658 and APSY-GE 2659). The counseling labs are designed to present students with an opportunity for experiential learning and practice in communication skills and counseling process. Based on a training program called Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR), the classes involve the use of training DVDs and audiovisual recording of counseling sessions to help students develop self-awareness, personal and professional insight, and basic counseling skills. APSY-GE 2658 is a prerequisite for APSY-GE 2659. Full time students are to complete these courses in the first and second semesters. Part time students should take these courses in the year prior to the start of their internship.    Grading for the lab courses is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon the circumstances. Those students in Lab I who have not acquired the necessary insight or skill level required for advancement to Lab II will be required to repeat Lab I.    Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab II will be subject to review by the counseling program faculty.    It is important to read the course information notes prior to registering for a lab course. Certain course sections are designated for school counseling students and other sections for counseling for mental health and wellness students.    Internship    Students in the CMHW program are required to meet the state licensure requirement of 600 hours (300 hours per semester or about 20 hours per week) during two consecutive semesters in an appropriate setting approved by the Internship Director. Students are supervised by a licensed mental health professional.    The internship takes place in the second or final year. To support the fieldwork, students register for and complete APSY-GE 2655 and APSY-GE 2656 (Internship in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness I and II) in the fall and spring semesters during the internship year. APSY-GE 2655 is a pre-requisite for APSY-GE 2656. Students must register for each of these courses during the semester prior to the one in which they plan to take the course. Full time students complete coursework, the internship, and internship seminar concurrently.    Grading for the internship courses is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon the circumstances.    Internship preparation workshops will be held late in the fall semester. These information sessions will be announced on the listserv. You must attend one session in order to prepare for the process involved in securing an internship placement site. You will work closely with Corinne Miller Weinman, Director of Internship and Training, during this process.    State-Mandated Requirement    All CMHW students must complete the state-mandated workshop that covers Identifying and Reporting Child Abuse prior to the start of internship. This workshop can be completed online within two hours over thirty days. Upon completion, students will be provided with an electronic certificate of completion, which must then be forwarded to the academic advisor. This is a graduation requirement; therefore, it is imperative that students provide the academic advisor with proof of completion. Students are responsible for keeping a copy for themselves, as many employers will also require proof of completion of this workshop. Students should complete this requirement during November or December of the first semester. You will receive more information from the academic advisor early in the first semester. It is not necessary (or encouraged) for you to complete the workshop at this time.    Culminating/Terminal Experience    The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) is the terminal experience for the MA counseling programs. The exam should be taken during the student&rsquo;s last semester of matriculation in the program. It is usually held during the last Friday of October and the first Friday in March. The fee for taking the CPCE is $50.00.       Course Load       Students typically register for 15 units per semester in the first year. Full time students take a minimum of 12 units per semester. Depending on semester course loads and whether they complete summer coursework, students sometimes have fewer than 12 units remaining in the final semester.    Students are encouraged to take some courses over the winter session and/or summer session in order to lighten the course load during the second year. Students typically register for 12 credits per semester during the second year, which includes the internship.    Most summer classes offered by the Department of Applied Psychology run during four three-week sessions. Students are limited to taking one course per session but may take as many as four courses over the summer, if necessary.    The winter session takes place during three weeks in January, prior to the start of the spring semester. Students are limited to taking one course per winter session. Tuition and fees for the winter session course are applied toward the spring semester . Students may register for a winter course when they register for spring classes. Students may register for a winter course when they register for spring classes.    Students who are required to take a minimum of 12 units in order to remain eligible for scholarships but who have fewer than 12 units remaining in their final semester should contact the academic advisor for instructions to avoid having the scholarship canceled.    Students who are taking 6-11 units in a semester are considered part time and still meet financial aid eligibility. If visas or other reasons require a student to be half time or full time, students may be granted equivalency. Equivalency may be granted only for the purposes of visas, student loans, student loan deferral, TAP and Veterans&rsquo; Benefits requirements. For more information about this, please review the full policy . It is important to understand that students only receive aid for the number of credits for which they are registered, regardless of equivalency status.       First Semester Coursework       Full-time students are REQUIRED to take the following courses in the first semester:    APSY-GE 2661  Foundations in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2657  Individual Counseling: Theory and Process* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2658  Individual Counseling: Practice I* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2138  Human Growth and Development       Full-time students should choose ONE of the following additional courses for their first semester:    APSY-GE 2038  Abnormal Psychology* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2138  Human Growth and Development* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2634  Dynamics of Vocational Development 3 credits    APSY-GE 2620  Group Dynamics* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2682  Cross Cultural Counseling* 3 credits    Applied Content Area Elective/Special Population Course** 3 credits       Part time students typically take 6-9 credits per semester.

APSY-GE 2138, APSY-GE 2620, and APSY-GE 2682 will also be offered over the summer.    **Students may elect to take an applied content area or special population course in the first semester if they know what specific area in which they would like to intern. Students choosing to take an elective should consult with the academic advisor.    Students should complete the Identification and Reporting Suspected Child Abuse 0 credit online workshop during the first semester (in November/December). The academic advisor will send out information about this in September.    The following sections of APSY-GE 2658 are specifically for SCHOOL COUNSELING students: 004. 005, 008, and 012. Please be sure you do not register for one of these sections of Practice I.       Faculty Mentors       At the beginning of the Fall semester, students will have the opportunity to select on a first-come, first serve basis a faculty mentor in the counseling programs. Students should choose their mentor based on shared interests.    All students are required to select a faculty mentor. Selection will take place via online survey. The role of the faculty mentor is to provide academic and professional guidance. Faculty mentors are available to answer general curriculum related questions (e.g., &ldquo;I am interested in XYZ, what courses will match my interests?&rdquo;), provide guidance to students looking to join a research team, provide support to students who plan to apply to PhD programs, and assist in remediation process, if necessary.       Research       While not required, many students choose to participate on research teams with faculty. Depending on the needs of the team, students may spend anywhere from 5-20 hours a week on research (in most cases, these positions are unpaid). At the welcome reception on the first day of classes, students will have an opportunity to hear from faculty about their research and whether they have space on their teams for new students.        Don't forget to complete the survey so that you can be cleared to register!

Program Requirements/Advising Records       Knowing your program requirements is crucial to your success in your program. The advising record lists all program requirements; you should keep a copy handy at all times to track your progress.    Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness Registration Planner    Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness Advising Record    Course Sequencing    Foundational Courses (Please refer to your advising record) are to be taken first, in conjunction with intermediate courses, followed by advanced courses. Other requirements may be taken as they fit into student programs. Intermediate courses are each offered in the fall and spring (Group Dynamics, Cross-Cultural Counseling, Human Growth and Development, along with elective courses, are also offered in the summer).    For part-time students, the course sequence remains the same. However, part-time students need to pay special attention to pre- and co-requisites in planning their programs and should meet with the academic advisor prior to registration each semester.    Students must successfully complete the following courses before beginning the internship:    APSY-GE 2651 Professional Orientation &amp; Ethical Issues in CMHW    APSY-GE 2661 Foundations of Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness    APSY-GE 2657 Counseling: Theory and Process    APSY-GE 2658 Individual Counseling: Practice I    APSY-GE 2659 Individual Counseling: Practice II (Prereq: APSY-GE 2658)    APSY-GE 2038 Abnormal Psychology    APSY-GE 2138 Human Growth and Development    APSY-GE 2620 Group Dynamics: Theory and Practice    APSY-GE 2682 Cross-cultural Counseling    If a student plans to pursue licensure outside of New York State, it is recommended that the student research any academic and clinical requirements for a particular state in which he or she plans to work so that the student can complete appropriate coursework and fieldwork hours while at NYU.    Lab    In order to gain and strengthen counseling skills, students complete a two-course lab sequence called Individual Counseling: Practice I and II (APSY-GE 2658 and APSY-GE 2659). The counseling labs are designed to present students with an opportunity for experiential learning and practice in communication skills and counseling process. Based on a training program called Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR), the classes involve the use of training DVDs and audiovisual recording of counseling sessions to help students develop self-awareness, personal and professional insight, and basic counseling skills. APSY-GE 2658 is a prerequisite for APSY-GE 2659. Full time students are to complete these courses in the first and second semesters. Part time students should take these courses in the year prior to the start of their internship.    Grading for the lab courses is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon the circumstances. Those students in Lab I who have not acquired the necessary insight or skill level required for advancement to Lab II will be required to repeat Lab I.    Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab II will be subject to review by the counseling program faculty.    It is important to read the course information notes prior to registering for a lab course. Certain course sections are designated for school counseling students and other sections for counseling for mental health and wellness students.    Internship    Students in the CMHW program are required to meet the state licensure requirement of 600 hours (300 hours per semester or about 20 hours per week) during two consecutive semesters in an appropriate setting approved by the Internship Director. Students are supervised by a licensed mental health professional.    The internship takes place in the second or final year. To support the fieldwork, students register for and complete APSY-GE 2655 and APSY-GE 2656 (Internship in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness I and II) in the fall and spring semesters during the internship year. APSY-GE 2655 is a pre-requisite for APSY-GE 2656. Students must register for each of these courses during the semester prior to the one in which they plan to take the course. Full time students complete coursework, the internship, and internship seminar concurrently.    Grading for the internship courses is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon the circumstances.    Internship preparation workshops will be held late in the fall semester. These information sessions will be announced on the listserv. You must attend one session in order to prepare for the process involved in securing an internship placement site. You will work closely with Corinne Miller Weinman, Director of Internship and Training, during this process.    State-Mandated Requirement    All CMHW students must complete the state-mandated workshop that covers Identifying and Reporting Child Abuse prior to the start of internship. This workshop can be completed online within two hours over thirty days. Upon completion, students will be provided with an electronic certificate of completion, which must then be forwarded to the academic advisor. This is a graduation requirement; therefore, it is imperative that students provide the academic advisor with proof of completion. Students are responsible for keeping a copy for themselves, as many employers will also require proof of completion of this workshop. Students should complete this requirement during November or December of the first semester. You will receive more information from the academic advisor early in the first semester. It is not necessary (or encouraged) for you to complete the workshop at this time.    Culminating/Terminal Experience    The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) is the terminal experience for the MA counseling programs. The exam should be taken during the student&rsquo;s last semester of matriculation in the program. It is usually held during the last Friday of October and the first Friday in March. The fee for taking the CPCE is $50.00.       Course Load       Students typically register for 15 units per semester in the first year. Full time students take a minimum of 12 units per semester. Depending on semester course loads and whether they complete summer coursework, students sometimes have fewer than 12 units remaining in the final semester.    Students are encouraged to take some courses over the winter session and/or summer session in order to lighten the course load during the second year. Students typically register for 12 credits per semester during the second year, which includes the internship.    Most summer classes offered by the Department of Applied Psychology run during four three-week sessions. Students are limited to taking one course per session but may take as many as four courses over the summer, if necessary.    The winter session takes place during three weeks in January, prior to the start of the spring semester. Students are limited to taking one course per winter session. Tuition and fees for the winter session course are applied toward the spring semester . Students may register for a winter course when they register for spring classes. Students may register for a winter course when they register for spring classes.    Students who are required to take a minimum of 12 units in order to remain eligible for scholarships but who have fewer than 12 units remaining in their final semester should contact the academic advisor for instructions to avoid having the scholarship canceled.    Students who are taking 6-11 units in a semester are considered part time and still meet financial aid eligibility. If visas or other reasons require a student to be half time or full time, students may be granted equivalency. Equivalency may be granted only for the purposes of visas, student loans, student loan deferral, TAP and Veterans&rsquo; Benefits requirements. For more information about this, please review the full policy . It is important to understand that students only receive aid for the number of credits for which they are registered, regardless of equivalency status.       First Semester Coursework       Full-time students are REQUIRED to take the following courses in the first semester:    APSY-GE 2661  Foundations in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2657  Individual Counseling: Theory and Process* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2658  Individual Counseling: Practice I* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2138  Human Growth and Development       Full-time students should choose ONE of the following additional courses for their first semester:    APSY-GE 2038  Abnormal Psychology* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2138  Human Growth and Development* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2634  Dynamics of Vocational Development 3 credits    APSY-GE 2620  Group Dynamics* 3 credits    APSY-GE 2682  Cross Cultural Counseling* 3 credits    Applied Content Area Elective/Special Population Course** 3 credits       Part time students typically take 6-9 credits per semester. Part time students should begin with a combination of two classes from the following list:    APSY-GE 2651 Professional Orientation and Ethical Issues in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness (strongly recommended)    APSY-GE 2661 Foundations in Counseling for Mental Health and Wellness (strongly recommended)    APSY-GE 2138 Human Growth and Development    APSY-GE 2657 Individual Counseling: Theory and Process    Part time students should NOT take APSY-GE 2658/9 Individual Counseling: Practice I/II until the year prior to their internship.    *Course must be successfully completed prior to internship. APSY-GE 2038, APSY-GE 2138, APSY-GE 2634, APSY-GE 2620, and APSY-GE 2682 will be offered in the spring semester as well. APSY-GE 2138, APSY-GE 2620, and APSY-GE 2682 will also be offered over the summer.    **Students may elect to take an applied content area or special population course in the first semester if they know what specific area in which they would like to intern. Students choosing to take an elective should consult with the academic advisor.    Students should complete the Identification and Reporting Suspected Child Abuse 0 credit online workshop during the first semester (in November/December). The academic advisor will send out information about this in September.    The following sections of APSY-GE 2658 are specifically for SCHOOL COUNSELING students: 004. 005, 008, and 012. Please be sure you do not register for one of these sections of Practice I.       Faculty Mentors       At the beginning of the Fall semester, students will have the opportunity to select on a first-come, first serve basis a faculty mentor in the counseling programs. Students should choose their mentor based on shared interests.    All students are required to select a faculty mentor. Selection will take place via online survey. The role of the faculty mentor is to provide academic and professional guidance. Faculty mentors are available to answer general curriculum related questions (e.g., &ldquo;I am interested in XYZ, what courses will match my interests?&rdquo;), provide guidance to students looking to join a research team, provide support to students who plan to apply to PhD programs, and assist in remediation process, if necessary.       Research       While not required, many students choose to participate on research teams with faculty. Depending on the needs of the team, students may spend anywhere from 5-20 hours a week on research (in most cases, these positions are unpaid). At the welcome reception on the first day of classes, students will have an opportunity to hear from faculty about their research and whether they have space on their teams for new students.        Don't forget to complete the survey so that you can be cleared to register!
