The principal faculty in the department are Barbara Weinstein, Ada Ferrer, Sinclair Thomson and Greg Grandin. While each of the principal faculty focus on distinct geographical regions (Brazil, Caribbean, Andes, and Central America) and thematic subjects (slavery, race, revolution, gender, political violence, relations with the United States), all share a broad engagement with social and cultural history and encourage students to pursue both interdisciplinary and transnational approaches. Within the history department, there is much discussion and exchange between students and faculty working on Latin America and Caribbean and those in other national and transnational fields, such as Atlantic World, African-Diaspora, Africa, and the United States. Outside of the Department of History, NYU\u2019s Center for Latin America and Caribbean Studies and the King Juan Carlos Center (which offers cultural programming on Spain and the Spanish-speaking world), both share a building with the Department of History and offer doctoral students additional lecture and course opportunities.
