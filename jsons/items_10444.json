Conspiracy Theories: Paranoid Fictions After Freud    RUSSN-GA 2122 Borenstein. 4 points. 2013-14. With its clash of ideologies and the rise and fall of metanarratives (modernism, postmodernism, Marxism), the 20th century saw a proliferation of conspiracy theories and intricate attempts to impose rational order on increasingly chaotic systems.

The novel has been for a long time understood by its theorists as the genre par excellence of truthlessness. This course attempts to reevaluate this view, proposing that the 19th-century novel in particular should be understood as responding to the emerging tendency to view truth as inseparable from, rather than opposed to, time. This tendency, then, can be said to account for the specific shape and the remarkable \"success\" of the 19th-century European novel.

An  introduction to Russian 20th-century fiction, concentrating on the two periods  of greatest cultural ferment: 1920s modernism and late/post-Soviet  postmodernism.

How  American slaves and Russian serfs wrote and were written about in the two  countries' literary traditions. Considers the attempts of subjugated people to  represent themselves to the dominant culture and the difficulties that members  of the dominant culture confronted in writing about people whose experiences were  largely inaccessible to them. Particular attention is paid to how categories  such as \"slave,\" \"peasant,\" \"white,\" and \"black\" have changed over time and to  how unfree people worked to turn what were perceived as cultural lacks into  aesthetic advantages.          20th-Century  Russia: Terror, Survival, and Beautiful Dreams    RUSSN-UA  859 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Encompasses  the last years of the tsars and the Russian Revolution and utilizes such  diverse media as film, literature, visual art, and music. Topics include: Lenin  and communism; Stalinism; the Second World War; the end of Communism and the  transition to capitalism. Considers how the fundamentally humanistic ideology  of Communism produced one of the most murderous and oppressive regimes of the  century and how an international movement became increasingly chauvinistic and  nationalistic.          Theories  of Symbolic Exchange    RUSSN-UA  860 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    In  his seminal essay \"On the Gift\" (1923) Marcel Mauss developed a concept of an  alternative, non-market type of economy, based on a non-monetary exchange of  such symbolic values as social recognition, sovereignty, and political  participation. Today, this concept has acquired a new relevance in relation to the  economy of the Internet. Examines various theories of the symbolic that expand  the original Maussian model and encompass multiple aspects of culture: from  Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois and Mikhail Bakhtin to Jacques Derrida and  Jean Baudrillard.
