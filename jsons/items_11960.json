Grades, Feedback and Comments tool  The Division of Educational Informatics released a new system in April 2014 for posting unofficial grades and comments that is easier for individual students to access and has the utmost security precautions in place. Grade information is accessible both via My Workspace and individual ALEX sites. Any information posted from each module or clerkship will be available in a consolidated view for each student. For students who previously completed clerkships (e.g., Class of 2015), individual clerkships are working to repost past unofficial grades and comments via this new tool. Should you have questions or are missing comments, please email dei.support@med.nyu.edu and we aim to facilitate making that information available.  As before, official grades, comments and transcripts reside within the Office of Registration and Student Records.  Syncing Your Academic Schedule to Your Phone  For  those students enrolled in courses still utilizing the ALEX Schedule,  your personal calendar can be synced to a mobile device (i.e. a calendar  that shows ONLY your sections and not that of the entire class): Instructions are available at: http://dei.med.nyu.edu/help/alex/how-subscribe-alex-course-calendar  For those students whose Stage 1 events are populated in CURIE , you can sync a consolidated CURIE schedule to your mobile device by performing the following: Log into ALEX and visit the Curriculum Explorer (see above) Click the My Schedule button in the upper right-hand order Click on Subscribe Copy and paste the link in the appropriate settings screen of your smartphone Please  note that as of June 2014, all UME courses will utilize the CURIE  Schedule and the ALEX calendars will be fully retired.
