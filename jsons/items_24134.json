Students are accompanied by program faculty for short-term, in-depth learning experiences during Winter Intersession, Spring Break, and Summer Term, during which time they engage in study and exploration of a country&rsquo;s higher education system in the context of local economic, political, and social realities. Students may earn between 3-6 credits for these courses. Additional information about cost, availability, and application can be found on the Steinhardt Global Programs site .    International Opportunities    Our program offers enriching global opportunities to our students.    India: Part-Time Student Nick Heller (M.A. '14)             As a part time student in the HESA program I knew I wanted to study abroad from the first time it was mentioned by my adviser and was specifically interested in India because of its rich and diverse culture, and heritage.  During the two weeks in India, our class visited a variety of public and private institutions. I grew tremendously through interacting with students and experiencing their hospitality and passion for learning. Some of the cultural highlights included exploring Mumbai and Kerala in rickshaws, and spending an evening watching a kite festival from a beach side rooftop. This has truly been a perspective changing learning experience.                South Africa: Full-Time Student Amber Lodman (M.A. '14)             The South Africa study abroad program was distinct because of the hearty contextual experience it provides. Yes, South Africa is a beautiful country and its story frames a powerful narrative. You will visit schools, meet people, become acquainted with a culture and gain knowledge of a young democracy. Consider what you will bring there and what you may carry back. l met people and captured moments that influenced who I want to be to the world. That was compelling. Do consider cost, but greatly consider investing in an experience, one which I am carrying throughout life.                Turkey: Full-Time Student Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                      Other Global Programs    Some of our students also participate in study abroad programs available through other NYU programs and departments.    Argentina [Education &amp; Advocacy]: Full-Time Student Lauren Jordan (M.A. '14)                There are many electives outside of our program that directly relate to Higher Education that also broaden the scope of our concentration. Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU. The program reminded me of the importance of activism within the educational system and my own life. This experience was one of the best decisions I have made during my time at NYU.                   London [HIV Prevention &amp; Counseling]: Part-Time Student Ryan Loiter (M.A. '14)                The opportunity to take a class outside of the HESA program was a bit refreshing as a second year student. The opportunity to study in London, another major cosmopolitan city, was exciting and the HIV Prevention and Counseling course was truly eye-opening. In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with. I was made better because of this course.                             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University. All rights reserved.

Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU. The program reminded me of the importance of activism within the educational system and my own life. This experience was one of the best decisions I have made during my time at NYU.                   London [HIV Prevention &amp; Counseling]: Part-Time Student Ryan Loiter (M.A. '14)                The opportunity to take a class outside of the HESA program was a bit refreshing as a second year student. The opportunity to study in London, another major cosmopolitan city, was exciting and the HIV Prevention and Counseling course was truly eye-opening. In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with. I was made better because of this course.                             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University. All rights reserved.

A predominantly Muslim country, Turkey has a highly centralized government with strong control of education, including universities. The economy is robust, and Turkey is noted for having the 15th largest Gross Domestic Product. Turkey borders Europe, Asia and the Middle East and is increasingly seen as an important political and cultural force in both the region and the global community.    Turkey has several institutions of higher learning which date back more than 500 years, and has also seen rapid development and expansion among universities in the last few decades. Changes in national law in 1981 permitted the establishment of private non-profit universities. Today there are 102 public universities and 52 private universities, all under the jurisdiction of central policy agencies and a national testing and admissions system. Several top public and private universities are internationally ranked. The system also includes vocational colleges and teacher training institutions.    Global Perspectives in Higher Education: Turkey will include preparatory sessions here at NYU in late February and early March; travel to Turkey mid-March; return from Turkey late March; and follow up classes at NYU in late March. It is intensive trip, that includes some touring in Istanbul; visits to two public and two private universities in Istanbul; travel to Ankara for an additional university visit and meetings with government officials; travel to Cappadocia, a region with many ancient sites where we will have time for some touring and a visit to one regional institution.    Full-Time Student Perspective: Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                   Part-Time Student Perspective: Lesia Harhaj (M.A. '13)                I consider my experience as part of Global Perspectives in Higher Education: Turkey study away program to be a defining moment for me as a part-time student in the HESA program at NYU. Participating in this course allowed me to take advantage of a unique educational opportunity, but to also connect with my fellow students and faculty. From the travel, to the university visits, to the food, and to the camaraderie that was established &ndash; this is an experience that significantly impacted how I view myself as a higher education professional and informs how I interact with my students today.                   Full-Time Student Perspective: Cameron Mussar (M.A. '14)                Regardless of the brevity of the Turkish study away experience, the opportunity to examine a system of higher education outside of the United States, to interact with students, faculty, administration, and government officials provided a great deal of perspective to my understanding of the role that education plays across cultures, and beyond borders. This global opportunity widened my understanding of how higher education is approached, and has given me the skills to more critically examine our system of education at home.                   *Turkey photos by Betty Tsang (M.A. '13)              This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

International Opportunities    Our program offers enriching global opportunities to our students.    India: Part-Time Student Nick Heller (M.A. '14)             As a part time student in the HESA program I knew I wanted to study abroad from the first time it was mentioned by my adviser and was specifically interested in India because of its rich and diverse culture, and heritage.  During the two weeks in India, our class visited a variety of public and private institutions. I grew tremendously through interacting with students and experiencing their hospitality and passion for learning. Some of the cultural highlights included exploring Mumbai and Kerala in rickshaws, and spending an evening watching a kite festival from a beach side rooftop. This has truly been a perspective changing learning experience.                South Africa: Full-Time Student Amber Lodman (M.A. '14)             The South Africa study abroad program was distinct because of the hearty contextual experience it provides. Yes, South Africa is a beautiful country and its story frames a powerful narrative. You will visit schools, meet people, become acquainted with a culture and gain knowledge of a young democracy. Consider what you will bring there and what you may carry back. l met people and captured moments that influenced who I want to be to the world. That was compelling. Do consider cost, but greatly consider investing in an experience, one which I am carrying throughout life.                Turkey: Full-Time Student Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community.

Argentina [Education &amp; Advocacy]: Full-Time Student Lauren Jordan (M.A. '14)                There are many electives outside of our program that directly relate to Higher Education that also broaden the scope of our concentration. Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU.

In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with.

Students are accompanied by program faculty for short-term, in-depth learning experiences during Winter Intersession, Spring Break, and Summer Term, during which time they engage in study and exploration of a country&rsquo;s higher education system in the context of local economic, political, and social realities. Students may earn between 3-6 credits for these courses. Additional information about cost, availability, and application can be found on the Steinhardt Global Programs site .    International Opportunities    Our program offers enriching global opportunities to our students.    India: Part-Time Student Nick Heller (M.A. '14)             As a part time student in the HESA program I knew I wanted to study abroad from the first time it was mentioned by my adviser and was specifically interested in India because of its rich and diverse culture, and heritage.  During the two weeks in India, our class visited a variety of public and private institutions. I grew tremendously through interacting with students and experiencing their hospitality and passion for learning. Some of the cultural highlights included exploring Mumbai and Kerala in rickshaws, and spending an evening watching a kite festival from a beach side rooftop. This has truly been a perspective changing learning experience.                South Africa: Full-Time Student Amber Lodman (M.A. '14)             The South Africa study abroad program was distinct because of the hearty contextual experience it provides. Yes, South Africa is a beautiful country and its story frames a powerful narrative. You will visit schools, meet people, become acquainted with a culture and gain knowledge of a young democracy. Consider what you will bring there and what you may carry back. l met people and captured moments that influenced who I want to be to the world. That was compelling. Do consider cost, but greatly consider investing in an experience, one which I am carrying throughout life.                Turkey: Full-Time Student Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                      Other Global Programs    Some of our students also participate in study abroad programs available through other NYU programs and departments.    Argentina [Education &amp; Advocacy]: Full-Time Student Lauren Jordan (M.A. '14)                There are many electives outside of our program that directly relate to Higher Education that also broaden the scope of our concentration. Education and Advocacy with Gary Anderson is one such course. I was privileged with the opportunity to study in Buenos Aires for 2 weeks in August of 2013. Education and Advocacy in Buenos Aires is taught through the lens of The Dirty War with a focus on the impact of civil society on educational reform. The program gave me a new perspective and enriched my knowledge of education. I learned more about the role of government and the private sector in education and was able to discuss my ideas with a diverse group of students from across NYU. The program reminded me of the importance of activism within the educational system and my own life. This experience was one of the best decisions I have made during my time at NYU.                   London [HIV Prevention &amp; Counseling]: Part-Time Student Ryan Loiter (M.A. '14)                The opportunity to take a class outside of the HESA program was a bit refreshing as a second year student. The opportunity to study in London, another major cosmopolitan city, was exciting and the HIV Prevention and Counseling course was truly eye-opening. In all my years in education I have never felt such emotion to a topic as I did in this class. The opportunity to visit clinics, both here and abroad, and be educated in a subject matter that carries so much stigma and misunderstanding, left me feeling that I had responsibility to educate my peers and the students I work with. I was made better because of this course.                             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University. All rights reserved.

A predominantly Muslim country, Turkey has a highly centralized government with strong control of education, including universities. The economy is robust, and Turkey is noted for having the 15th largest Gross Domestic Product. Turkey borders Europe, Asia and the Middle East and is increasingly seen as an important political and cultural force in both the region and the global community.    Turkey has several institutions of higher learning which date back more than 500 years, and has also seen rapid development and expansion among universities in the last few decades. Changes in national law in 1981 permitted the establishment of private non-profit universities. Today there are 102 public universities and 52 private universities, all under the jurisdiction of central policy agencies and a national testing and admissions system. Several top public and private universities are internationally ranked. The system also includes vocational colleges and teacher training institutions.    Global Perspectives in Higher Education: Turkey will include preparatory sessions here at NYU in late February and early March; travel to Turkey mid-March; return from Turkey late March; and follow up classes at NYU in late March. It is intensive trip, that includes some touring in Istanbul; visits to two public and two private universities in Istanbul; travel to Ankara for an additional university visit and meetings with government officials; travel to Cappadocia, a region with many ancient sites where we will have time for some touring and a visit to one regional institution.    Full-Time Student Perspective: Jennifer Low (M.A. '14)                Visiting Turkey was my first time traveling abroad and I am glad I was able to share this experience with members of the Steinhardt community. The visits to different universities were an amazing opportunity to speak with Turkish students, administrators, and faculty about their personal experiences in higher education. In addition to these visits, we also explored Turkey by visiting mosques, trying Turkish cuisine, and touring the Hagia Sophia. The experience allowed me to develop an understanding of the Turkish culture and higher education system, which has enhanced my multicultural knowledge and overall ability to support students in my career.                   Part-Time Student Perspective: Lesia Harhaj (M.A. '13)                I consider my experience as part of Global Perspectives in Higher Education: Turkey study away program to be a defining moment for me as a part-time student in the HESA program at NYU. Participating in this course allowed me to take advantage of a unique educational opportunity, but to also connect with my fellow students and faculty. From the travel, to the university visits, to the food, and to the camaraderie that was established &ndash; this is an experience that significantly impacted how I view myself as a higher education professional and informs how I interact with my students today.                   Full-Time Student Perspective: Cameron Mussar (M.A. '14)                Regardless of the brevity of the Turkish study away experience, the opportunity to examine a system of higher education outside of the United States, to interact with students, faculty, administration, and government officials provided a great deal of perspective to my understanding of the role that education plays across cultures, and beyond borders. This global opportunity widened my understanding of how higher education is approached, and has given me the skills to more critically examine our system of education at home.                   *Turkey photos by Betty Tsang (M.A. '13)              This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
