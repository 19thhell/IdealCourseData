Professionals who understand these game-changing shifts similarly recognize our need for newer forms of management. That recognition leads them to the School of Engineering&#39;s MS program in Management (MSM).   The program is defined by a pragmatic, results-oriented approach emphasizing the integration of people and technology, which we achieve through courses designed to help you develop decision-making skills. Even subjects such as accounting, finance, and marketing are taught not as special areas of expertise, but as basic tools for managerial decision-making in a tech-heavy, knowledge-based workplace.   You&rsquo;ll build on such core competencies by focusing on 1 of the following concentrations:      entrepreneurship    electronic business    project management    technology management    information and telecommunications management    human resource management    construction management     By the program&rsquo;s end, you&rsquo;ll be able to allocate and direct human, financial, and physical resources, as well as technological and organizational assets, for maximum performance.   Best of all, you can learn these skills while maintaining a busy career since classes are typically scheduled after regular business hours.   Admission Requirements   Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or an acceptable equivalent test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be requested to support admission.   The program requires some fundamental knowledge of probability and statistics. Students without such a background are required to take a managerial probability and statistics course such as MA 2054, MG 5050, or its equivalent. Students with this background may apply to waive this requirement.

With information technology (IT) having become an indispensible element of the business world, strong managers with information and systems specialties are in high demand. These positions are now closely aligned with the C-Suite, and to excel in them, you must be as adept at crafting budgets and understanding organizational structures as you are in designing and implementing company-wide computer upgrades.   The M.S. in Management and Systems is a unique program that provides you with strong business leadership skills and comprehensive knowledge of information technologies that can enable an organization to improve its financial or marketplace performance. With a focus on the alignment and the integration of management information systems and technology with key business strategies, the program provides you the competitive advantage of understanding organizations as complex systems with a shared vision.       The program can be completed fully online, or in a traditional classroom setting, or by blending a combination of the two formats. The curriculum is taught by accomplished practitioners who possess significant management expertise and in-depth knowledge of the latest innovations in information technology. Students can select one of four concentrations:     Strategy and leadership   Enterprise risk management   Systems management   Database technologies             Program Locations : NYU Midtown Center , Online           View General Curriculum            Learn More            NYU School of Professional Studies faculty and staff members look forward to learning more about you, and we want you to learn more about us, to ensure that your decisions regarding your educational experience are well informed.

Professionals who understand these game-changing shifts similarly recognize our need for newer forms of management. That recognition leads them to the School of Engineering&#39;s MS program in Management (MSM).   The program is defined by a pragmatic, results-oriented approach emphasizing the integration of people and technology, which we achieve through courses designed to help you develop decision-making skills. Even subjects such as accounting, finance, and marketing are taught not as special areas of expertise, but as basic tools for managerial decision-making in a tech-heavy, knowledge-based workplace.   You&rsquo;ll build on such core competencies by focusing on 1 of the following concentrations:      entrepreneurship    electronic business    project management    technology management    information and telecommunications management    human resource management    construction management     By the program&rsquo;s end, you&rsquo;ll be able to allocate and direct human, financial, and physical resources, as well as technological and organizational assets, for maximum performance.   Best of all, you can learn these skills while maintaining a busy career since classes are typically scheduled after regular business hours.   Admission Requirements   Satisfactory scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) or an acceptable equivalent test, such as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), may be requested to support admission.   The program requires some fundamental knowledge of probability and statistics. Students without such a background are required to take a managerial probability and statistics course such as MA 2054, MG 5050, or its equivalent. Students with this background may apply to waive this requirement.
