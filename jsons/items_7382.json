Levon, a professor of Chemical and Biological Sciences , had long worked on conducting polymers, plastics that conduct electricity. His team began building a prototype biosensor, together with then-Poly Professor Arifur Rahman, whose specialty was vertical transistor design. The prototype was so promising, in 2004, Levon founded Anzenna to commercialize it. But the researchers were busy innovating and it didn\u2019t take off just then.     Fast forward to 2008, and the company was reinvigorated, explains Samir Ajmera, vice president of business development. Anzenna added two employees, several part-time staff, plus a team of interns and graduate researchers, and moved away from the defense market. Instead, the focus shifted to building diagnostic tests for the billion-dollar healthcare market.     \u201cThe transistor-based biosensor design is very unique. We have several patents on its structure and specific function,\u201d explains Ajmera. Though Anzenna hasn\u2019t yet sold a product, it has exclusively licensed six patents from NYU and is developing more advanced prototypes. Funding so far has come from institutional grants (federal, state, medical), not venture capitalists or private investors, but the plan is to raise private capital in mid-2011. After clinical trials, a product could be in doctors\u2019 hands around 2013.     For now, Anzenna\u2019s headquarters are both at the State University of New York Downstate Advanced Biotech Incubator and in Levon\u2019s lab at NYU-Poly. Along with healthcare, Anzenna\u2019s tech- nology may also, one day, also have applications in genomic sequencing, agriculture and environmental testing.

Levon, a professor of Chemical and Biological Sciences , had long worked on conducting polymers, plastics that conduct electricity. His team began building a prototype biosensor, together with then-Poly Professor Arifur Rahman, whose specialty was vertical transistor design. The prototype was so promising, in 2004, Levon founded Anzenna to commercialize it. But the researchers were busy innovating and it didn\u2019t take off just then.     Fast forward to 2008, and the company was reinvigorated, explains Samir Ajmera, vice president of business development. Anzenna added two employees, several part-time staff, plus a team of interns and graduate researchers, and moved away from the defense market. Instead, the focus shifted to building diagnostic tests for the billion-dollar healthcare market.     \u201cThe transistor-based biosensor design is very unique. We have several patents on its structure and specific function,\u201d explains Ajmera. Though Anzenna hasn\u2019t yet sold a product, it has exclusively licensed six patents from NYU and is developing more advanced prototypes. Funding so far has come from institutional grants (federal, state, medical), not venture capitalists or private investors, but the plan is to raise private capital in mid-2011. After clinical trials, a product could be in doctors\u2019 hands around 2013.     For now, Anzenna\u2019s headquarters are both at the State University of New York Downstate Advanced Biotech Incubator and in Levon\u2019s lab at NYU-Poly. Along with healthcare, Anzenna\u2019s tech- nology may also, one day, also have applications in genomic sequencing, agriculture and environmental testing.

No matter the topic, design has become an increasingly crucial editorial element. It sets one publication apart from the next, and at its best unifies the content and instantly telegraphs to the reader where it figures in the media landscape. In this workshop we will explore this rapidly changing world. We will discuss notions of good vs. bad design, engaging vs. dull content. And, through the development of in-class publications, will put into practice the many aspects that contribute to a magazine's creation, from initial concept to the realization of a prototype. Directed readings (including &quot;I Wonder&quot; and &quot;The Best American Magazine Writing 2011&quot;), fieldtrips, and visits from magazine professionals will contribute to our discussion.
