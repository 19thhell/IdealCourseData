Wolf is truly a monumental study. The book has made a major contribution to the understanding of one of the most significant symphonists of the mid-eighteenth century. This book had its origin in a Ph.D. dissertation that Wolf completed in 1972 at New York University under the direction of Jan LaRue and since then revised.   Wolf stated his purpose of the book is \"to develop an accurate and comprehensive analysis of Stamitz's symphonic style, its evolution and its historical position\". The book, for the first time, provides the essential information on matters of authenticity, clearly establishing why fifty-eight symphonies and ten orchestral trios can be attributed to Johann Stamitz, rather then other members of his family or other composers. With the main focus in creating a chronological listing of authentic Stamitz symphonies, Wolf divides his study into three main parts. In Part One the documentary evidence is investigated, in Part Two the music itself receives careful scrutiny, and the final part contains a thematic catalogue - the result of Part One and Part Two.   Part One opens with an extremely short biography of the composer due to lack of documents for the composer. Wolf also takes this opportunity to make clear what can and cannot be known, correcting some earlier writers' misinformation. The remainder of Part One is devoted to a study of all known documentary evidence of Stamitz's symphonies. Printed and MSS sources and entries in eighteenth century catalogues have been scrutinized and compared to determine their origin and reliability. In the absence of reliable outside documentation and evidence, the author feels compelled to rely on an examination of the music itself to arrive at his goal of creating an accurate list of Stamitz's symphonies.   In the opening chapters of Part Two, Wolf focus on various structural patterns discernible in the symphonies. The overall organization of the cycle of movements, the structure of individual movements and parts of movements and the nature of phrases and phrase-groupings receive particular attention. In the following three chapters the symphonies are divided into three large chronological groups into 'early', 'middle' and 'late' periods and the characteristics of each group are discusses with numerous examples.   Wolf designates twenty symphonies in the early period -(Works up to 1741). The symphonies in this period follow the fast-slow-fast format with opening movements in common time, middle movements in 2/4, marked Andante, and the brief final movements in 3/8 or 2/4, marked Presto or Allegro. Especially important in helping to determine the early date of composition is the characteristic use of only a four-part string orchestra, with bassoon expected to double the bass and harpsichord to be used as continuo instrument. A pair of horns appears in only five of these early works and a pair of oboes in only one. The author conclude that, for Stamitz's early period, a clear homophonic texture is characteristic, and thematic material is often chordal or scalar, lacking any individual character.   The twenty-nine symphonies placed in Stamitz's middle period (from about 1741 to the early 1750s) are works that can be equated with the important contributions of the so-called \"Mannheim School\". There is a pronounced shift to the four-movement structure with minuet in the third movement, and, as related development, the finales are more often in 2/4 time and longer than those of earlier symphonies. The \"a 8\" - four-part strings + two oboes + two horns - scoring in this middle period becomes standard and in four works trumpets and timpani appear. The homophonic texture in the middle period is now frequently accompanied by the prominent use of string trmelo and, in comparison with the earlier works, contrapuntal procedures are adapted to the symphonic style, bringing some variety to the texture. During this period, Stamitz begins to make effective use of his famous crescendo passages, and thematic material becomes more distinctive, especially as secondary themes become more differentiated from primary themes.   Only nine symphonies and six orchestral trios belong to the final period (1752-1757).  The author notes a strong consistency of style in these later works, approaching a stylized phase. These four-movement symphonies are still scored \"a 8\" but now with the winds gaining more independence and even carrying important materials at times. Textural and rhythmic variety is increased and a greater use is made of a cantabile melodic style in fast movements.   Wolf has chosen to deal with the entire thirty-five dance movements of Stamitz's symphonic output in a single chapter (Chapter XIII) because of the consistent style writing throughout. The final chapter of Part II is short but provides an excellent summary of Stamitz's position in the history of the symphony. According to Wolf, Stamitz was not particularly innovative in his creativity in symphonic writing but his ability to adapt and extend the traits developed initially in the Italian opera overture was significant.   The thematic catalogue comprising the final part of the book is clear and precise. Wolf's study is so comprehensive and in detail that not only do we now have a clear understanding of Stamitz's symphonic writing, and his position in the history of the symphony, we also have a clear, documented introduction to the significant changes in musical style of the mid-eighteen century.                     ....Cindy Ying Shiung"}]},

Prince Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport-and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular-does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers' pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees' early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a working-class game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A full-length baseball-related research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston. A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn's Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72215) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72216) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, not-for-profit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one's professional responsibilities was desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical, analytical, and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties-customers, co-workers, community, etc.-further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School's M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72217) Instructor: David Lehman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a poet, critic, and editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this distinguished anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man. His recent books include The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry and The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets. His gathering of Great American Prose Poems: From Poe to the Present appeared in 2003. He is now preparing a new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry. He has taught the \"Great Poems\" seminar since 1997. He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, and Bennington College.    Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72218) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the so-called two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    Note: This seminar will meet in Weinstein Residence Hall. All students who register for this course and who requested University housing will be assigned to Weinstein.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Deutsches Haus. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 72220) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and true-to-lifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer's affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French), Cinema and Sentiment, and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life.    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72221) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 7:00-9:00 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles,and 21st-Century Problems (V50.0227; call # 72223) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely self-regulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or in social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19th-century liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought and in the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20th-century philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of such contemporary problems as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and social-religious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics , as well as co-director of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law, ethics and economics, and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a long-standing interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O'Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance, many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    From Moving Articulators to Sound Structure (V50.0233; call # 74958) Instructor: Adamantios I. Gafos Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Meaning in spoken language is communicated via sound. Sound is generated from a limited physical medium of moving articulators and their acoustic consequences. How can this physical system, the human vocal tract, communicate such richness of distinctions in meaning? To what extent is the structure of sound patterns in language influenced by constraints of the physical system? This course addresses these questions by seeking to identify the proper way to understand the relation between the cognitive aspects of sound structure and their manifestation as physical activity in the vocal tracts of actual speakers. The course begins by providing the necessary tools for exploring language sound structure. Using a research tool for visualizing multiple articulatory movements (called Mavis), we study how humans produce the consonants and vowels of different languages in isolation and in sequences. We then study how abstract sound patterns can be described as a system of conflicting and universal constraints. Different hierarchical relations between the same constraints give rise to the sound patterns of different languages. In the final part of the course, through a sequence of readings and group projects, students tackle issues in the relation between abstract sound patterns in a language of their choice and their realization in terms of activity in the vocal tract.    ADAMANTIOS I. GAFOS is Assistant Professor of Linguistics . After completing the Ph.D. in cognitive science at Johns Hopkins, and before coming to NYU, he taught at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, MIT, and Yale. His research focuses primarily on phonology, as a subfield of cognitive science, and specifically on the nature of phonological representations. He is the author of the book The Articulatory Basis of Locality in Phonology and of many scholarly articles.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72227) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically-with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature's richest theme: desire-its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turn-of-the-century French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator's sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author's extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world's greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is usually assumed to be France's greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words, and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations; a novel, Rock Me; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life. Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Realism and How to Get Rid of It (V50.0244; call # 74962) Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    Realism relates both to a permanent concern of literature and art and to a \"school\" that became the dominant mode of 19th-century artistic expression. In the large sense, realism is accuracy in the portrayal of life or reality; referring to the 19th-century literary movement, realism reflects the ordinary life of the average person. The realistic novel and theater focused on the conflicts and characters familiar to readers and spectators by means of artistic conventions relating to the credibility of plot and characters, the role of narration, the function of the reader/spectator. The 20th century turned its back on realism through a series of powerful modernist and avant-garde movements that reacted against linear narrative and a literal depiction of reality. Following an examination of 19th-century realism in the novel and theater (Balzac, James, Ibsen), the seminar stresses 20th-century reactions (Borges, Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Coover, Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter). These reactions include stream-of-consciousness novel, surrealism, abstract expressionism, Brechtian epic theater, theater of the absurd, first-person singular narrative, postmodern fiction. Attention is concentrated on form and language, on conventions, and on the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. Film viewings concentrate on non-narrative cinema (Renais, Antonioni). The work of realist and nonrealist painters is also discussed.    TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization. His books include studies of Beckett, Sartre, 20th-century theater, and French cultural and political life. His most recent book, From the Left Bank: Reflections on Contemporary French Theater and Fiction, appeared in 1997. He has received numerous decorations from the French government and was awarded the Grand Prize of the Acad?mie Fran?aise.    What If?: The Art and Science of Imaginative Social Constructions (V50.0249; call # 75032) Instructor: Robert Max Jackson Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Imaginary constructions of unknown futures or pasts that never happened can help us push our understanding of social life beyond the boundaries of historical experience. What if we discover a drug that stops the aging process? What if fossil fuels had never been found? By writing stories around such puzzling questions, science fiction writers explore imaginary social worlds far outside the boundaries erected by social science's normal study of the real world and real history. In this class, we try to discover how such imaginary constructions can help us understand social life and the meanings we attach to it. Each week we pose a \"What if . . . ?\" question, read a classic work of science fiction in which that question looms large, write our own analyses of what we think possible, then discuss the merits of these alternative interpretations. This class aims to develop students' analytical skills, to explore the scientific and philosophical foundations of social issues in a new way, and to offer a special window into the wonders of science fiction.    ROBERT MAX JACKSON , Professor of Sociology , studies the ways that social inequality changes over time, reflecting his enduring puzzlement with the trajectory that took him from his youth as rural poor, white trash in the American Midwest to adulthood as a New York academic. His Destined for Equality: The Inevitable Rise of Women's Status analyzes the social causes of women's rising status in American history, and his The Formation of Craft Labor Markets shows how markets for skilled labor became organized in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During breaks from his scholarly work, he indulges his secret addiction to science fiction and mystery novels, occasionally thinking he should discover some way to portray this fascination as serious work.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72229) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations of fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 72230) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72231) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electro-weak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics. His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72236) Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century. He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72237) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple by-products of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony-from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books-have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies' fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means-to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72238) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30-9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have arisen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU, ESQ. , is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a high-ranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow. Her B.A. is from Oberlin and her J.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. A national bar leader, she serves on numerous boards, has won awards for her service to the legal profession, and was the first woman of color to chair the American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which accredits American law schools. She currently chairs the ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession.    The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 72239) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review.    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 72241) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged-if not overly challenged-trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What's it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \"op-ed\" article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton's 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master's degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar-Activist (V50.0279; call # 72242) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868-1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first African-American to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the African-American condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the Pan-Africanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny African-American community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is the author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader. He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the African-American tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 72245) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional left-right cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and its democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine social-science analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark's highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam's controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics, and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations. He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology, a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community.    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the Israeli-Palestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 72249) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include Divine Intervention, by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls, by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure, by Ram Loevi; Wedding in the Galilee, by Michel Khleifi; and The Smile of the Lamb, by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 72254) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the power of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through discussion both of such readings as Walter Lippmann's Public Opinion, Robert Merton's Mass Persuasion, J. S. Mill's On Liberty, Herman Melville's Billy Budd, and Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, and of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Hearts and Minds, and JFK. Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind, which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York's pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1956). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and, to be published in November 2004, the paperback edition of As They Saw It . . . A Half Century of Conversations from The Open Mind. From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 72258) Instructor: William Klein Friday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality-Hobbes was a very good philosopher but perhaps not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes's radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of Humanities at NYU's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, on leave from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he teaches the history of Western social thought. He specializes in early modern European legal and political thought but has also published, under a pen name, several mysteries for young adults.    The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 72259) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 72261) Instructor: Mark Green Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush's top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn't consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders-President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress?), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990-93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994-2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1's Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D'Amato.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 72263) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan's geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country's social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country's relations with the nations that immediately surround it today-Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan's jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan's relations with al-Qa'ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 72265) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decision-making by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developing-country interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic self-determination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law's response to them, are examined critically. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of non-government organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.    RICHARD B. STEWART is University Professor and John Edward Sexton Professor of Law. He also directs the Center on Environmental and Land Use Law. His teaching and research focus on domestic and international environmental law, the role of economic incentives in environmental protection, law and globalization, and administrative law and regulation.

He previously served as Assistant Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources of the U.S. Department of Justice and as a faculty member at Harvard Law School and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.    Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 72269) Instructor: Jorge G. Casta?eda TBA    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America's problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTA?EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies . Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 72272) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Birth of Tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V50.0311; call # 74825) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    ALAN J. POMERANTZ, ESQ ., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm.

Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History (V50.0312; call # 74826) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social, and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, memoirs and diaries disclose the private aspects of everyday life, revealing crucial concealed thoughts and emotions as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with the most famous memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher-bohemian-heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Readings from the period of the Holocaust include two classics, the diaries of Anne Frank, a young girl, and Victor Klemperer, an elderly Jewish man. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor includes introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, 1904-1938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998). The last two won the National Jewish Book Award in their respective years. She has edited books on European women's history-When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History-and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    German Romantic Music, 1815-1850 (V50.0313; call # 74827) Instructor: Robert Bailey Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Many artists of this period revolted against prevailing artistic, and even social and political, institutions. They reacted against both the current cult of the virtuoso and the increasingly commercial climate dominated by music publishers. They withdrew into a private artistic world, and the Artist became the typical Romantic hero. The Wanderer in turn became the ideal symbolic projection of an artist alienated from a society uninterested in his work and in his welfare. This withdrawal led artists to participate in a private symbolic system accessible to themselves, but only partly accessible to middle-class audiences. German artists often restructured traditional relationships and affinities among the musical, poetic, and visual arts. Unable to find fulfillment in the troublesome present, they frequently sought vindication for their artistic ideals in the past. Hence, their interest in folksong, which inspired a large body of new poetry appropriate for musical setting. Such poetry provided the foundation for a flowering of song publications, which flourished alongside popular publications of actual folksongs. Opera, the song cycle, and the multi-movement piano cycle are the genres that most fully project the intricate system of interlocking and closely aligned musical, poetic, and visual imagery. The works in these genres by Weber, Schubert, Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Schumann, and Wagner are of central concern to the seminar.    ROBERT BAILEY is the Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music in the Faculty of Arts and Science. As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, he majored in music and German. He then studied piano at the Academy of Music in Munich. He did his graduate work in musicology at Princeton, where his principal mentors were Oliver Strunk and Milton Babbitt. He also continued piano study with Edward Steuermann, who was on the faculty of the Juilliard School. Before joining the faculty of NYU in 1986, he taught at Yale and at the Eastman School of Music.    Opium and China (V50.0314; call # 74828) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar highlights opium's material and symbolic role in China's history before and after the Opium Wars of the 19th century. Using both primary and secondary courses, it explores such issues as opium's economic role within China and in the global market; the nature and extent of addiction in China; global attitudes to opium use; the role of Chinese middlemen and consumers in the extraordinarily rapid spread of opium in China; and ways in which opium both complemented and changed perceptions of gender, in terms of drug use as well as in terms of foreign perceptions of China, since opium came to serve in complicated ways as a symbol for China itself.    JOANNA WALEY-COHEN is the author of The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History (1999) and Exile in Mid-Qing China: Banishment to Xinjiang, 1759-1820 (1991), as well as numerous articles on Chinese legal history, the military culture of the Qing empire, and the history of Hong Kong. Her current project is on gastronomy and gluttony in early modern China. Since 1992 she has taught a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in Chinese history at NYU, most recently on material culture, on the Silk Roads, on Qing history, and on interactions with Europe and the wider world.    Sport, Race, Ethnicity, and Gender in 20th-Century America (V50.0315; call # 74967) Instructor: Peter Levine Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    Although you may well learn why Nat Holman is in the Basketball Hall of Fame, why Ralph Branca cried in l951, or who Senda Berenson was, this seminar is not concerned with preparing you for sports trivia contests. Rather, its central purpose is to explore how race, ethnicity, gender, and class have influenced the development of organized sport as a major social and cultural institution of American life. During the first part of the semester we will collectively explore readings and films that touch on these themes. Later, we will devote considerable time learning how to write a major research paper, using both secondary and primary sources, including oral histories. Where possible and practical, students will be encouraged to make use of New York as a site for investigation and research.    PETER LEVINE was for many years Professor of American History and Director of American Studies at Michigan State University, before returning to his native Brooklyn in 2000. Whether focusing on ethnic studies or on popular culture, he has been especially attracted to interdisciplinary approaches and to reaching out to both scholarly and popular audiences. Best known for his work in sport and American social history, he is the author of Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience (1992), A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball (1985), and, with Robert Lipsyte, Idols of the Game (1995).    Latin American Nobel Prize Winners (V50.0316; call # 74966) Instructor: Mary Louise Pratt Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Prerequisite: ability to understand spoken and written Spanish This course is aimed at students who have a strong background in Spanish and enjoy studying literature. We will study the lives and works of the five writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1942), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Angel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez (1982), and the Mexican poet Octavio Paz (1990). In addition, we will look at the work of three writer-activists who have won the Nobel Peace Prize: the Costa Rican Oscar Arias (1987), the Argentine Adolfo Perez Esquivel (1980), and the Guatemalan Rigoberta Mench? (1992).We will study these writers in their Latin American context, and consider what it was about them that drew international attention. Reading their acceptance speeches, we will ask how they sought to negotiate the place of Latin America in the international imagination, and how their work was received at home and abroad. At the textual level, especially with poetic texts, we will compare different translations, as a way of exploring the use of language. Class and readings will be mainly in Spanish; class participation and written work may be in Spanish or English. The course will count toward the Spanish or Latin American Studies major.    MARY LOUISE PRATT , Silver Professor of Latin American Literature and Culture , is an eminent scholar in the field of Latin American culture. During the year 2003, she served as President of the Modern Language Association. She is the author of, among many other titles, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation, \"I Rigoberta Mench? and the Culture Wars,\" and \"Apocalypse in the Andes: Contact Zones and the Struggles for Interpretive Power.\"    From Mycenae to the Acropolis: Greek History and Art (V50.0317; call # 74965) Instructor: Guenter Kopcke Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This class aims at an understanding of the first thousand years of Greece's-and hence Western-political history. By the end of the fifth century B.C. the product (at least in Athens) is the individual familiar to us-the self-aware citizen, knowingly responsible for his or her actions. Greek art begins in the second millennium as a weapon of last resort of the disadvantaged in a lawless social climate. In the first millennium, as strife was progressively resolved by sparring with mental means rather than with physical force, the outline of a rationally controllable world emerges. That, in essence, will be seen as giving meaning to early Greek history and art. Demonstration will rely mostly on the contemporary mind and experience in reading (analyzing) primary evidence.    GUENTER KOPCKE is the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Before coming to this country, he served as Assistant Curator in Munich, taught at the University of Zurich, and participated in many excavations in Greece and Israel. In outlook more historian than archaeologist or art historian, he is interested chiefly in understanding the critical role of (visual) art in the image of man in the Western tradition. His fields of concentration are the first thousand years of this tradition, from the middle of the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium B.C.    The Many Faces of Shahrazad: Arab Women in Culture, Literature, and 20th-Century Film (V50.0318; call # 74957) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar introduces students to the role and status of women in Arab societies today. Through the examination of selected texts from a variety of sources, be they sacred or profane, students investigate the role of the religious, social, and cultural as well as the political in the formation of the lives and roles of contemporary Arab women. Whether in Qur'anic suras or tales from the Thousand and One Nights, contemporary Arab-American poets or novelists from the Arab world, the course assesses the traditional gender roles versus the rapidly changing status of women. Close readings of selected essays, poems, novels, and short fiction, written by both women and men, as well as the viewing of selected films and documentaries, seek to address some of these timely topics.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris, and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women's literature in the Arab world and exploring women's role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Her latest work, Seen and Heard, was published in spring 2004. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Recycling Music: from Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop (V50.0319; call # 74829) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    In 1953, the Russian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions in the musical Kismet. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin's oeuvre to construct the score. This is one of many instances in which musicians and composers of the 20th century have reached back into the past for inspiration, whether of direct musical content, instrumental forces, or literary material, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and the popular idiom. This class examines representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage (Kismet, Anya, Rent, Aida), ballet (Le Spectre de la Rose and any number of Chopin favorites), film (Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan; Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Eric Carmen, \"All by Myself,\" \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\"). After a brief introduction to the concepts of musical transference and parody in music, classes compare original \"classical\" compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music, and examine the kinds of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to the later incarnation. Also considered is the cross-over between classical composers/conductors and the popular music scene.    RENA CHARNIN MUELLER is a musicologist specializing in 19th-century music. Her work on Liszt's compositional aesthetic has appeared in various journals. Her most recent publication is an essay on the Liszt lieder in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Pr?ludes (1997), Trois ?tudes de Concert (1996) and the two Ballades (1996); and her edition of the newly discovered Liszt Walse was published in 1996. With M?ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000, and they are also co-authoring the new Franz Liszt Thematischer Verzeichnis (forthcoming). In 2003 she was a winner of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award.    Lost and Found in Translation (V50.0320; call # 75132) Instructor: Kathleen Ross Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Although we are not always aware of it, the process of translation figures prominently in our daily lives. Understanding another person's speech or writing is an act of translation, even when we speak the \"same\" language; according to some linguistic theories, all language is ultimately a translation. Translation, throughout history, has often been portrayed as an inevitable loss, a violence done to one language by another; the translator is characterized as a traitor, an imperialist, a thief, and the translation as only a pale copy of the \"original.\" Yet translation is crucial to the expansion of our sense of self in relation to an \"Other,\" and we cannot live fully without it. This course first examines some basic history and theories of translation, then considers the question of what is \"lost\" and what is \"found\" in the process, taking up examples from various historical moments. Throughout the course we will make use of multiple English translations of texts to spark our thinking. No knowledge of a language besides English is necessary.    KATHLEEN ROSS is Associate Professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese , where she has served as Director of Undergraduate Studies and as Chair. She is both a scholar of the Latin American colonial period and an active translator of 19- and 20th-century Spanish American essays, poetry, and fiction. She has published translations of works by C?sar Vallejo, Roque Dalton, Julieta Campos, and others. Her translation of Domingo F. Sarmiento's classic 1845 essay Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism was published by the University of California Press in 2004.    Travelers and Travelogues in History (V50.0321; call # 75111) Instructor: Zvi Ben-Dor Benite Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar uses travelogues-journals and memoirs written by travelers-as historical sources. We will read several travelogues written by different travelers from different periods and learn to devise ways and methods to interrogate them for the purpose of historical inquiry. During the course we will try to answer several questions such as: Who are the authors of the travelogues and what can we learn about them from their texts? How do they describe the societies and landscapes they visit and what can we learn from the travelogues? Most importantly, we will try to come up with a list of many other questions the answers for which can be found in travelogues. The travelogues selected for this seminar stretch over different periods and cover different regions of the world such as Asia, Africa, and Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern period. We will read travel stories by, among others, Benjamin of Tudela, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Olaudah Equiano.    ZVI BEN-DOR BENITE is Assistant Professor of History . His specialty is world history, specifically the relations between East Asia, West Asia, and Europe during the Middle Ages and the early modern periods. He is the author of The Dao of Muhammad: A Cultural History of Muslims in Late Imperial China.    Staging Shakespeare's Comedies (V50.0322; call # 75380) Instructor: Peter W. Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course examines the comedic work of William Shakespeare, focusing specifically on five major works-The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, and The Tempest. The course involves a practical element where students discuss staging, performance, interpretation, and the meaning of these works today. Class members are expected to participate in active workshops and dramatic explorations, although they do not need to have any performing experience; these practical workshops are designed to be purely exploratory and not performative. In addition to practical work, this course studies Shakespeare's influences, examining the origin of comedy, the theater of ancient Greece and Rome, including the works of Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, and Terence, traditional English comedic forms, and Elizabethan satire, culture, and politics. It also considers the influence of Shakespearean comedy on successive dramatic forms, including the theater, film, and television. Students interested in this course should be prepared actively and intelligently to participate in discussions and practical workshops and follow a good amount of reading.    PETER W. MEINECK is Clinical Assistant Professor of Classics and Ancient Studies at NYU and the Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, a New York and national professional theater group specializing in fresh and innovative productions of classical drama, especially Shakespeare. Recently the Aquila's Othello formed the main focus of the National Endowment for the Arts' Shakespeare in American Communities program.

He has been teaching at NYU for the past five years and has also held academic appointments at Princeton and Harvard, among other U.S. universities. He is originally from London, England.    Before Cleopatra: Royal Women of Ancient Egypt (V50.0323; call # 75381) Instructor: Ann Macy Roth Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Long before Cleopatra, the royal women of ancient Egypt often had a great deal of influence on world events. Some even became pharaohs in their own right, and were depicted with a beard and a male body or wearing the ceremonial dress of a king over the modest traditional dress of a woman. Others exercised religious authority in priestly offices or as the ceremonial wife of a god. This course examines the lives and roles of these women, as reflected in the art, archaeology, and texts of their own times, and often in their own words. Questions examined include the assumptions about gender and sex underlying Egyptian culture, the practical and symbolic roles of queens, the character of women's monuments, the destruction of some monuments of powerful women by later generations, and changes in the roles of elite women over almost three millennia of Egyptian history. Through their culturally anomalous position, we come to understand some important principles of gender and power in Egypt, and perhaps elsewhere as well. In addition, we examine the views of these women taken by Western scholars and popular media, and how such understandings of their roles reflect the evolution of our own cultural attitudes.    ANN MACY ROTH is Clinical Associate Professor in the Departments of Hebrew and Judaic Studies and Fine Arts . Her research focuses mainly on the earlier periods of ancient Egyptian culture, particularly mortuary traditions and the roles of gender and sexuality in Egyptian society. She is director of the Giza Cemetery Project, and since 1987 has conducted archaeological research in the officials' tombs to the west of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Her publications include Egyptian Phyles of the Old Kingdom: The Evolution of a System of Social Organization, A Cemetery of Palace Attendants at Giza, and numerous articles. She has been invited to write three essays for Daughter of Re: Hatshepsut, King of Egypt, the catalogue of an exhibition opening in spring 2006 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    Making Choices in Contemporary America: Dedication, Deception, and Deals (V50.0324; call # 74964) Instructor: Frederick G. More Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Have you ever done what you thought was the right thing only do find yourself feeling that your right choice left you at a disadvantage? This course uses a case-study approach to reflect on issues in bioethics and contemporary life. Examples include such cases as that of Erin Brockovich, whose routine work in a law office led to the discovery of injustices suffered by citizens in a California city; a family who wanted to remove their daughter from life support, after years in a persistent vegetative state, only to become the focus of a legal controversy that reached the Supreme Court; the research project in which for 40 years U.S. Public Health Service researchers deprived 600 black men with syphilis of their right to health care; the Reagan administration's denial of the HIV epidemic in the U.S.; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendations about nutrition that resulted from an intensely partisan process and deal-making. During the course we use movies, books, articles, and self-study as vehicles for reflection about the personal values that one can employ for decision-making and for exploration of personal and medical ethics.    FREDERICK G. MORE is Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion and the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in the NYU College of Dentistry. While formerly associate dean for academic affairs there, he developed and implemented the present dental curriculum. Prior to his faculty appointment at NYU, he was on the faculty of the University of Michigan.

Dr. More has served on the NYU Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research Activities and is currently on the NYU School of Medicine Institutional Review Board Associates.    By Any Means Necessary: Presidential Politics in the Post-Watergate Era (V50.0325; call # 74963) Instructor: Cheryl Mills Wednesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    Since Watergate, the policy agenda of the presidency has become increasingly defined not just by the ideas of the individual holding office but by the tactical allegations and actions of forces external to the White House. Today, a president's agenda gains support or faces opposition from governmental forces-in the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary-and nongovernmental forces, including political parties, special-interest groups, think tanks, political action organizations, and the media. It has become commonplace for all parties, including the president and his staff, to seek to accomplish their public policy aims by engaging in the politics of obstruction and personal attack to undermine confidence in the opposition's agenda for America. From election campaigns to presidential appointments to impeachment to the exercise of war powers, the president and his political opposition must be adept at navigating the politics of personal destruction. This class studies presidential politics since Watergate. It examines the presidency in relation to its governmental counterparts, the judiciary and Congress, as well as to the nongovernmental entities. Using media accounts (electronic, print, and televised), congressional and judicial testimony, judicial decisions, historical accounts, and first-person narratives, it assesses the players, the methods, and the impact on the presidency of public policy dissent and disagreement by any means necessary.    CHERYL MILLS, ESQ. , is Senior Vice President and Counselor for Operations and Administration at NYU. She received the J.D. from Stanford Law School, where she was elected to the Stanford Law Review. In the Clinton administration she served as Deputy Counsel to the President at the White House, where she supervised 35 attorneys and staff. She gained national prominence for her defense of President Clinton during the 1999 Senate impeachment trial. From 1999 to 2001, before joining NYU, she was Senior Vice President for Corporate Policy and Public Programming at Oxygen Media. She serves on the boards of numerous foundations, schools, and corporations.    Vienna 1900: The Art and Culture of Viennese Modernism (V50.0326; call # 75378) Instructor: Guy Walton Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30-1:45 p.m.    At the turn of the 20th century, Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, became an important center of \"modern\" architecture, art, applied arts, music, philosophy, and science (particularly medicine/psychiatry). After a brief survey of the geography and history of the Austrian Empire and description of the city of Vienna, the course examines a selection of the major monuments of Vienna, especially those related to European modernism, and five operas. The focus is thus on art, architecture, and music, stressing the relationship of these to the cultural and intellectual milieu of this splendid capital city. Among the artists to be studied are Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Richard Strauss. New York museums, commercial art galleries, and the new Neue Galerie provide an important resource for the seminar.    GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts in the College of Arts and Science. He received his Ph.D. from NYU's Institute of Fine Arts and is well known for his publications on the art of the royal courts of Europe, particularly those of France, Sweden, and Russia. He is also a collector of 20th-century Austrian decorative arts.    The Politics of Judicial Decision-Making (V50.0327; call # 75128) Instructor: Anna Harvey Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    This seminar is about how we can and should understand how U.S. Supreme Court justices decide cases. We begin by posing the problem of the countermajoritarian Court. Given the apparent absence of mechanisms to hold the justices accountable to popular preferences, can we come up with rules of statutory and constitutional interpretation that constrain the justices' decisions in normatively desirable ways? We review several of these theories of interpretation. What do they prescribe? How constraining would they be in practice? Would they in fact lead to better outcomes? We then turn to work that seeks to determine what the justices are actually doing when they decide cases. We first examine the justices' decisions in cases involving statutory interpretation. We then examine their decisions in constitutional cases. What kinds of data are used in these studies? What are their conclusions? How believable are they? Is the Court really countermajoritarian? Finally, we return to the normative theories with which we started. Given what we have learned from the positive work on the Court, do they still have any relevance?    ANNA HARVEY is Associate Professor of Politics . She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University. Having joined the Department of Politics in 1994, she served as its chair from 2000 to 2003. She is the author of Votes without Leverage: Women in American Electoral Politics, 1920-1970, as well as of many scholarly articles. Her research focuses on two areas: the nature of partisanship in the American electorate and the political constraints on judicial decision-making. In the latter project, she and her collaborator at NYU's Law School are investigating the extent to which the Supreme Court is constrained by the political branches in constitutional cases.    Charity, Philanthropy, and the Nonprofit Sector (V50.0328; call # 75379) Instructors: Harvey P. Dale and Jill S. Manny Wednesday, 3:30-5:30 p.m.    This course explores the nonprofit sector and its role in society, from a perspective that touches on legal, economic, policy, and other realms. After a look at the history and scope of the nonprofit sector, we discuss the burdens and benefits of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. We consider how charities derive resources and how they expend them to further their charitable purposes. We examine the distinction between public charities and private foundations, and invite leaders of both sorts of charities to join us in class for a discussion. We discuss governance of charities, both by federal and state regulators and by officers, directors, and trustees. We focus on the things that the nonprofit sector does well, and some of its performance failures, as we consider recent publicized scandals and abuses within the sector and estimate their impact on the sector. We analyze relevant legal concepts and theories, including the rules for tax exemption and tax deductions, and consider why these benefits are offered to certain organizations. We also consider those who donate their time and resources, examining both donor motivation and donor intent. Finally, we discuss nonprofit speech viewed through the lens of legal restrictions on lobbying and political campaign activities by nonprofits.    HARVEY P. DALE is University Professor of Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. Since 1988 he has been Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. The Founding President of The Atlantic Philanthropies, he has also served as board member of or consultant to a wide range of other nonprofit organizations and institutions. He is the author of numerous publications on philanthropy and the law. JILL S. MANNY joined the faculty at NYU School of Law in 1993, where she teaches courses on Nonprofit Law, Tax-Exempt Organizations, and Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving. In 1995 she assumed there the additional position of Executive Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law. She also teaches Nonprofit Law at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service.    Extra-solar Planets and Astrobiology (V50.0329; call # 75382) Instructor: Glennys Farrar Monday, 4:55-7:25    Questions about the existence of other planets and about life on those planets have been with us since the dawn of time. Since the realization that not only the Earth but the other planets of our solar system orbit the Sun and that life on Earth depends on sunlight, mankind has searched for more planets in our own solar system and for planets orbiting other stars. In the last ten years these searches have finally succeeded. The search for and study of other planetary systems is now a major theme of current astrophysics research. This course introduces that work, exploring why searching for planets is so difficult and why it finally succeeded. It presents an overview of cosmology and star formation, to see how stars \"work\" and why planets around other stars would be expected to be common. By contrast, the scientific study of the origin and evolution of life (astrobiology) is an emerging discipline, with quite different ideas on how widespread life may be in the universe. This state of affairs gives students a chance to observe a new scientific discipline in its formative period, and to understand how scientists go about posing and refining questions, even when there are many more questions than answers and it is not yet clear how to formulate the fundamental problems.    GLENNYS FARRAR is Professor of Physics and Director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU. Before coming to NYU in 1998, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and on the faculties of the California Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. Her current work focuses mainly on problems at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, including ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.    Departmental Seminars Available for Freshmen       Freshman Colloquium: Borges, the Storyteller (V95.0250, sec. 001; call # 74352) Instructor: Sylvia Molloy Tuesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    This seminar, conducted in Spanish, has two goals: to read the work of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and to reflect on narrative, specifically, on storytelling. Why do we tell stories? How do we put them together in order to achieve the desired results? Are stories \"just\" fiction? Is history \"just\" a story? What about autobiography? What power do storytellers have over us and why do we listen to them? Why do we call them fabricators and, at the same time, say that their stories ring true? A master narrator, Borges resorts to storytelling in all the genres he practices-short fiction, principally, but also essays and poetry. A close reading of his work allows us not only to reflect on the question of narrative but also, more importantly, to enjoy the pleasure of the written text. Readings include Borges's Ficciones , El Aleph , El informe de Brodie , and Antologia poetica .    Freshman Colloquium: Nueva York (V95.0250, sec. 002; call # 74353) Instructor: James Fern?ndez Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    Through the analysis of a series of essays, short stories, novels, plays, and films, this course explores (1) New York as an important site of production of Spanish-language culture from the early 19th century to the present and (2) representations of New York in Spanish-language culture during that same period. Readings include Jos? Mart? (Cuba), Cr?nicas de Nueva York ; Federico Garc?a Lorca (Spain), Poeta en Nueva York ; Rene Marqu?s (Puerto Rico), La carreta ; Ernesto Qui?onez (Ecuador), El vendedor de sue?os ; Antonio Mu?oz Molina (Spain), and Ventanas de Manhattan. The course is conducted in Spanish.                        Welcome!

Wolf is truly a monumental study. The book has made a major contribution to the understanding of one of the most significant symphonists of the mid-eighteenth century. This book had its origin in a Ph.D. dissertation that Wolf completed in 1972 at New York University under the direction of Jan LaRue and since then revised.   Wolf stated his purpose of the book is \"to develop an accurate and comprehensive analysis of Stamitz's symphonic style, its evolution and its historical position\". The book, for the first time, provides the essential information on matters of authenticity, clearly establishing why fifty-eight symphonies and ten orchestral trios can be attributed to Johann Stamitz, rather then other members of his family or other composers. With the main focus in creating a chronological listing of authentic Stamitz symphonies, Wolf divides his study into three main parts. In Part One the documentary evidence is investigated, in Part Two the music itself receives careful scrutiny, and the final part contains a thematic catalogue - the result of Part One and Part Two.   Part One opens with an extremely short biography of the composer due to lack of documents for the composer. Wolf also takes this opportunity to make clear what can and cannot be known, correcting some earlier writers' misinformation. The remainder of Part One is devoted to a study of all known documentary evidence of Stamitz's symphonies. Printed and MSS sources and entries in eighteenth century catalogues have been scrutinized and compared to determine their origin and reliability. In the absence of reliable outside documentation and evidence, the author feels compelled to rely on an examination of the music itself to arrive at his goal of creating an accurate list of Stamitz's symphonies.   In the opening chapters of Part Two, Wolf focus on various structural patterns discernible in the symphonies. The overall organization of the cycle of movements, the structure of individual movements and parts of movements and the nature of phrases and phrase-groupings receive particular attention. In the following three chapters the symphonies are divided into three large chronological groups into 'early', 'middle' and 'late' periods and the characteristics of each group are discusses with numerous examples.   Wolf designates twenty symphonies in the early period -(Works up to 1741). The symphonies in this period follow the fast-slow-fast format with opening movements in common time, middle movements in 2/4, marked Andante, and the brief final movements in 3/8 or 2/4, marked Presto or Allegro. Especially important in helping to determine the early date of composition is the characteristic use of only a four-part string orchestra, with bassoon expected to double the bass and harpsichord to be used as continuo instrument. A pair of horns appears in only five of these early works and a pair of oboes in only one. The author conclude that, for Stamitz's early period, a clear homophonic texture is characteristic, and thematic material is often chordal or scalar, lacking any individual character.   The twenty-nine symphonies placed in Stamitz's middle period (from about 1741 to the early 1750s) are works that can be equated with the important contributions of the so-called \"Mannheim School\". There is a pronounced shift to the four-movement structure with minuet in the third movement, and, as related development, the finales are more often in 2/4 time and longer than those of earlier symphonies. The \"a 8\" - four-part strings + two oboes + two horns - scoring in this middle period becomes standard and in four works trumpets and timpani appear. The homophonic texture in the middle period is now frequently accompanied by the prominent use of string trmelo and, in comparison with the earlier works, contrapuntal procedures are adapted to the symphonic style, bringing some variety to the texture. During this period, Stamitz begins to make effective use of his famous crescendo passages, and thematic material becomes more distinctive, especially as secondary themes become more differentiated from primary themes.   Only nine symphonies and six orchestral trios belong to the final period (1752-1757).  The author notes a strong consistency of style in these later works, approaching a stylized phase. These four-movement symphonies are still scored \"a 8\" but now with the winds gaining more independence and even carrying important materials at times. Textural and rhythmic variety is increased and a greater use is made of a cantabile melodic style in fast movements.   Wolf has chosen to deal with the entire thirty-five dance movements of Stamitz's symphonic output in a single chapter (Chapter XIII) because of the consistent style writing throughout. The final chapter of Part II is short but provides an excellent summary of Stamitz's position in the history of the symphony. According to Wolf, Stamitz was not particularly innovative in his creativity in symphonic writing but his ability to adapt and extend the traits developed initially in the Italian opera overture was significant.   The thematic catalogue comprising the final part of the book is clear and precise. Wolf's study is so comprehensive and in detail that not only do we now have a clear understanding of Stamitz's symphonic writing, and his position in the history of the symphony, we also have a clear, documented introduction to the significant changes in musical style of the mid-eighteen century.                     ....Cindy Ying Shiung"}, {"content": "Freshman Honors Seminars: Fall 2004, CAS | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty       About the College | Programs | Students | Admissions | Alumni                  Back to Home             Freshman Honors Seminars: Fall 2004   Baseball and American Culture (V50.0206; call # 72214) Instructor: Carl E. Prince Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    Baseball is neither a metaphor for life nor a perfect explanation for the uniqueness of American culture or American character. But sport-and, for some cogent reasons, baseball in particular-does provide a way into an examination of major contemporary historical questions in the areas of race, gender, and class. The Brooklyn Dodgers' pioneering role in American racial integration in the years after World War II, for example, and the Yankees' early failure to follow suit provide useful laboratories for a study of race. The strongly macho character of baseball reveals basic gender aspirations and prejudices more subtly evoked in other areas of American life. To the extent that baseball is indeed a working-class game, fan involvement reveals much about the nature of urban class values and tensions in the 20th century. A full-length baseball-related research paper is required.    CARL E. PRINCE is Professor of History Emeritus and past president of the Society for Historians of the Early American Republic. He has published four books and numerous articles on early American political culture and edited the five-volume Papers of William Livingston. A former baseball player and lifelong fan, he is also the author of Brooklyn's Dodgers: The Bums, the Borough, and the Best of Baseball (1996), which opened for him a new academic field.    Computer Simulation (V50.0207; call # 72215) Instructor: Charles S. Peskin Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics    Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations, and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds, are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.    CHARLES S. PESKIN is Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science . His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor's Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.    Professional Responsibility: Markets, Ethics, and Law (V50.0208; call # 72216) Instructor: Daniel Diamond Monday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Every individual, regardless of his or her chosen field of study or occupation, will in time function as a professional or manager in a business, not-for-profit, or government organization. This course is designed to enable individuals to think critically about the ethical context and consequences of the decisions they will make in their respective professional and organizational settings. In previous generations understanding and practicing one's professional responsibilities was desirable, if not required, behavior. In our society today it is a necessity. We explore the reasons for this change and, by examining the interactions between the marketplace, societal norms, and the law, develop the ethical, analytical, and reasoning tools necessary to identify and weigh often competing interests. Ideally this enables individuals to make decisions that simultaneously cause no harm to the affected parties-customers, co-workers, community, etc.-further the goals of the organization, and enhance the professional career of the decision maker. The requisite ethical reasoning tools are developed through a series of cases and related readings dealing with a variety of topics, including ethics of the individual business professional, product liability, the social responsibility of the corporation, moral standards across borders, ethical issues in financial markets, termination and downsizing, sexual harassment, and privacy. Since this is a case course, students play an active role in the learning process during class sessions.    DANIEL DIAMOND is Professor of Economics at the Stern School of Business. He served as Dean of the Stern Undergraduate College and as Vice Dean of the Stern School from 1985 to 1995. He also held the position of Dean of the College of Management Science at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell and Director of the Northeast Region Small Business Development Center. He has published extensively in the areas of U.S. economic history, labor force trends, and labor policy. He currently teaches \"The Global Business Environment: International Macroeconomics and Finance\" and \"Professional Responsibility\" in the Stern School's M.B.A. program.    Great Poems (V50.0209; call # 72217) Instructor: David Lehman Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    The aim of this course is to change your life. We will read a selection of the greatest poems in the English language and consider what makes them great. We will discuss what distinguishes American from British poetry, and we will give some attention to questions of poetic influence and methods of composition. But the primary focus will be on reading, interpreting, and evaluating the poems themselves. The poets under consideration will include Shakespeare, Donne, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Byron, Whitman, Dickinson, Yeats, Eliot, Frost, Stevens, Auden, and Bishop. The course will conclude with some examples of contemporary American poetry.    DAVID LEHMAN is a poet, critic, and editor. In 1988 he initiated \"The Best American Poetry,\" and he continues as the general editor of this distinguished anthology series. In 1991 he published a critique of deconstruction entitled Signs of the Times: Deconstruction and the Fall of Paul de Man. His recent books include The Daily Mirror: A Journal in Poetry and The Last Avant-Garde: The Making of the New York School of Poets. His gathering of Great American Prose Poems: From Poe to the Present appeared in 2003. He is now preparing a new edition of The Oxford Book of American Poetry. He has taught the \"Great Poems\" seminar since 1997. He has also taught at Columbia University, New School University, and Bennington College.    Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature (V50.0210; call # 72218) Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the so-called two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon and from nontechnical texts on quantum and chaos theories.    Note: This seminar will meet in Weinstein Residence Hall. All students who register for this course and who requested University housing will be assigned to Weinstein.    FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German and Director of Deutsches Haus. Winner of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching, the University's Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.    Cinema and Affect: Why the Movies Move Us (V50.0217; call # 72220) Instructor: Charles Affron Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Popular cinema most obviously appeals to its viewers by telling stories and representing a semblance of life. But if the movies ultimately move us they do so because they convey story and true-to-lifeness through style and through the specific properties of the cinematic medium. This seminar focuses on \"conventional\" narrative films of the 1930s and 1940s to examine how (1) the weight of style and (2) the intrinsically emotional elements of the medium elicit the viewer's affective response. The model of life serves the model of art; viewers respond to the medium when its conditions echo those of life. Film beguiles viewers to enter into its processes, and then uses those processes to capture lifelike representations of emotional situations. How do framing, display, staging, camera movement, sound, theatricality, irony, and duration conspire with narrative to move us to tears? How are viewers impelled to move with moving pictures, to be moved by them?    CHARLES AFFRON is Professor of French and Director of Graduate Studies in that department. In addition to books on the French novel and on the French Romantic theater and poetry, he has published Star Acting: Gish, Garbo, Davis, Divine Garbo (in French), Cinema and Sentiment, and Sets in Motion (with Mirella Jona Affron), a study of the relationship between set design and narrative in cinema. In 2001 he published the biography Lillian Gish: Her Legend, Her Life.    The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America (V50.0218; call # 72221) Instructor: John E. Sexton Monday, 7:00-9:00 p.m.    Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy.    JOHN E. SEXTON , President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.    Freedom, Classical Liberal Principles,and 21st-Century Problems (V50.0227; call # 72223) Instructor: Mario J. Rizzo Monday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the principles of classical liberalism through the discussion of theoretical and empirical issues in economics, law, and ethics. \"Classical liberalism\" is the political, economic, social, and moral philosophy that is severely skeptical of the power of the state and seeks to reduce its power over the citizen. It advances the view that society, under the rule of law, is largely self-regulating, and so government intervention, whether in economic or in social affairs, is either unnecessary or simply makes problems worse. Sometimes classical liberalism is called \"19th-century liberalism,\" but its development has roots in ancient Roman thought and in the 18th-century Scottish Enlightenment, as well as in many strains of 20th-century philosophy and economics. Its leading thinkers have included Adam Smith, F. A. Hayek, and Milton Friedman. The course considers philosophical principles and empirical issues in the context of such contemporary problems as free trade, property rights, income distribution, and social-religious toleration.    MARIO J. RIZZO is Associate Professor of Economics , as well as co-director of the Austrian Economics Program. His fields of research lie at the interface of a number of academic subjects, including the economic analysis of law, ethics and economics, and the methodology and philosophy of economics. He also has a long-standing interest in political philosophy. He is the author (with Gerald O'Driscoll) of The Economics of Time and Ignorance, many articles in law journals, and philosophically oriented articles on economic theory.    From Moving Articulators to Sound Structure (V50.0233; call # 74958) Instructor: Adamantios I. Gafos Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Meaning in spoken language is communicated via sound. Sound is generated from a limited physical medium of moving articulators and their acoustic consequences. How can this physical system, the human vocal tract, communicate such richness of distinctions in meaning? To what extent is the structure of sound patterns in language influenced by constraints of the physical system? This course addresses these questions by seeking to identify the proper way to understand the relation between the cognitive aspects of sound structure and their manifestation as physical activity in the vocal tracts of actual speakers. The course begins by providing the necessary tools for exploring language sound structure. Using a research tool for visualizing multiple articulatory movements (called Mavis), we study how humans produce the consonants and vowels of different languages in isolation and in sequences. We then study how abstract sound patterns can be described as a system of conflicting and universal constraints. Different hierarchical relations between the same constraints give rise to the sound patterns of different languages. In the final part of the course, through a sequence of readings and group projects, students tackle issues in the relation between abstract sound patterns in a language of their choice and their realization in terms of activity in the vocal tract.    ADAMANTIOS I. GAFOS is Assistant Professor of Linguistics . After completing the Ph.D. in cognitive science at Johns Hopkins, and before coming to NYU, he taught at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, MIT, and Yale. His research focuses primarily on phonology, as a subfield of cognitive science, and specifically on the nature of phonological representations. He is the author of the book The Articulatory Basis of Locality in Phonology and of many scholarly articles.    In Search of Lost Time (V50.0240; call # 72227) Instructor: Marcelle Clements Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically-with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel in seven volumes and 4,500 pages, In Search of Lost Time addresses literature's richest theme: desire-its remembrance, loss, perversion, defeat, triumph, and final resurgence in the form of art. Almost 100 years old, it remains a dazzling portrait of turn-of-the-century French beau monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its narrator's sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines breadth, virtuosity, and irony, the author's extraordinary psychological acuity and the glamour of his world, as well as how it merges social history, ennui, and lust. It is also one of the world's greatest, most pleasurable, and elating reads. Although Marcel Proust (1871-1922) is usually assumed to be France's greatest novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move on, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while the texture of In Search of Lost Time (association, evocation, magnification, play of words, and memory) may have been its most radical contribution to the art of the novel, this work cannot be understood until it has been read in its entirety. In this seminar, we will keep moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained.    MARCELLE CLEMENTS is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Her articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations; a novel, Rock Me; and a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life. Her most recent book is a novel, Midsummer.    Realism and How to Get Rid of It (V50.0244; call # 74962) Instructor: Tom Bishop Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    Realism relates both to a permanent concern of literature and art and to a \"school\" that became the dominant mode of 19th-century artistic expression. In the large sense, realism is accuracy in the portrayal of life or reality; referring to the 19th-century literary movement, realism reflects the ordinary life of the average person. The realistic novel and theater focused on the conflicts and characters familiar to readers and spectators by means of artistic conventions relating to the credibility of plot and characters, the role of narration, the function of the reader/spectator. The 20th century turned its back on realism through a series of powerful modernist and avant-garde movements that reacted against linear narrative and a literal depiction of reality. Following an examination of 19th-century realism in the novel and theater (Balzac, James, Ibsen), the seminar stresses 20th-century reactions (Borges, Beckett, Robbe-Grillet, Coover, Pirandello, Brecht, Ionesco, Genet, Pinter). These reactions include stream-of-consciousness novel, surrealism, abstract expressionism, Brechtian epic theater, theater of the absurd, first-person singular narrative, postmodern fiction. Attention is concentrated on form and language, on conventions, and on the relationship of the work to the reader or spectator. Film viewings concentrate on non-narrative cinema (Renais, Antonioni). The work of realist and nonrealist painters is also discussed.    TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization. His books include studies of Beckett, Sartre, 20th-century theater, and French cultural and political life. His most recent book, From the Left Bank: Reflections on Contemporary French Theater and Fiction, appeared in 1997. He has received numerous decorations from the French government and was awarded the Grand Prize of the Acad?mie Fran?aise.    What If?: The Art and Science of Imaginative Social Constructions (V50.0249; call # 75032) Instructor: Robert Max Jackson Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    Imaginary constructions of unknown futures or pasts that never happened can help us push our understanding of social life beyond the boundaries of historical experience. What if we discover a drug that stops the aging process? What if fossil fuels had never been found? By writing stories around such puzzling questions, science fiction writers explore imaginary social worlds far outside the boundaries erected by social science's normal study of the real world and real history. In this class, we try to discover how such imaginary constructions can help us understand social life and the meanings we attach to it. Each week we pose a \"What if . . . ?\" question, read a classic work of science fiction in which that question looms large, write our own analyses of what we think possible, then discuss the merits of these alternative interpretations. This class aims to develop students' analytical skills, to explore the scientific and philosophical foundations of social issues in a new way, and to offer a special window into the wonders of science fiction.    ROBERT MAX JACKSON , Professor of Sociology , studies the ways that social inequality changes over time, reflecting his enduring puzzlement with the trajectory that took him from his youth as rural poor, white trash in the American Midwest to adulthood as a New York academic. His Destined for Equality: The Inevitable Rise of Women's Status analyzes the social causes of women's rising status in American history, and his The Formation of Craft Labor Markets shows how markets for skilled labor became organized in the 19th and early 20th centuries. During breaks from his scholarly work, he indulges his secret addiction to science fiction and mystery novels, occasionally thinking he should discover some way to portray this fascination as serious work.    New Media Law and Content Creation (V50.0253; call # 72229) Instructor: Karl P. Kilb Monday, 6:20-8:50 p.m. This course explores the legal and journalistic issues surrounding the creation and distribution of content in the \"Electronic Information Age.\" Content is a commodity that is packaged in many forms, known as \"media.\" We are all consumers of content, which is tailored by each media organization to target specific audiences. Consumers base their content choices on the type of information, as well as on the method of delivery. The traditional print and broadcast media have found a powerful, relatively inexpensive new means of distribution: the Internet. The rapid packaging of content by means of new technology has forced content creators and distributors to develop new interpretations of fundamental intellectual property issues, including copyright law. The seminar will promote active research and discussions with leaders in the media and legal professions, and explore how legislation and industry practices are responding to new technology.    KARL P. KILB, ESQ. , is the General Counsel of Bloomberg LP, managing a global Legal/Contracts Department. Before becoming an attorney in 1995, he was a broadcast journalist at FNN, CNBC, 1010 WINS Radio, Bloomberg, and various other networks and stations in New York for twelve years, having graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in broadcast journalism from NYU. He frequently lectures at universities and industry organizations about media and intellectual property law.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies (V50.0255; call # 72230) Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.    ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for education in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.    Modern Concepts of Matter and the Cosmos (V50.0256; call # 72231) Instructor: Daniel Zwanziger Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Prerequisite: high school physics    Since the 1970s our understanding of matter has been dominated by a paradigm known as \"the Standard Model\" of elementary particle physics. According to this model, the basic forces of nature are the strong and electro-weak forces that are transmitted by \"gauge\" fields, and the gravitational force that is described by general relativity. Elementary particles are either the quanta of the gauge fields themselves, including gluons and photons, or quarks and leptons that interact and are bound by the exchange of these quanta. This seminar reviews the Standard Model and the evidence for it. The geometric character of gauge and gravitational fields is described. Modern theories of the cosmos are presented, in the light of recent observations. Since the nature of modern physical theories is quite mathematical and geometrical, students taking this course should be intrigued by mathematical concepts.    DANIEL ZWANZIGER is Professor of Physics. His special research interest is quantum field theory applied to elementary particles. His most recent publications deal with the theory of quarks and gluons known as quantum chromodynamics.    Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity (V50.0267; call # 72236) Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The past century has witnessed violence the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide, terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism, fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we will examine the origin of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche called this the \"death of God\" (and the Devil); it could also be called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We will study the origins and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein, Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we will ask whether the modern human sciences can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this escalation of violence.    JAMES GILLIGAN headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He is now an Adjunct Professor at NYU, Director of the Center for the Study of Violence, a member of President Clinton's National Commission on Youth Violence, and author of Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic and Preventing Violence: An Agenda for the Coming Century. He has been a consultant to the Department of Injuries and Violence Prevention at the World Health Organization, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and numerous other organizations.    The Art of the Enemy (V50.0270; call # 72237) Instructor: Hector Feliciano Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The destruction of the art of the enemy, or cultural looting, has almost always been one of the staple by-products of international, civil, or religious strife. From ancient or biblical times to the recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Afghanistan, art plunder and the willful destruction of cultural patrimony-from palaces, museums, libraries, churches, mosques, and synagogues to paintings, statues, icons, and books-have been used by the victors as a supplementary means to conquer, annihilate, and humiliate the enemy. By studying some examples of destruction and looting, we will explore the enemies' fascinating political, aesthetic, or religious justifications for these acts. We will also consider why some enemies destroy while others simply take along, sell, or abandon; we will describe the positive and negative role of museums in some of these events, and learn how the \"values of collecting\" and the creation of museums may have helped to preserve art destined to be destroyed or looted by others. Above all, we will constantly be redefining what art is and what it means-to us and to our enemies. There will be guest speakers and field trips to museums.    HECTOR FELICIANO is a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. Formerly cultural writer for the Paris bureaus of the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, he is the author of The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Works (1997); first published in French, this work has since been translated into several other languages. He served on the Panel of Experts of the Presidential Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States. He is the organizer of the First International Symposium on Cultural Property and Patrimony (Columbia University, 1999) and of a panel discussion entitled \"The Art of the Enemy\" (School of Visual Arts in New York City, 2002).    What Makes a Great Leader?: Perspectives from Government, Law, and Business (V50.0275; call # 72238) Instructor: Diane C. Yu Monday, 6:30-9:00 p.m.    Machiavelli wrote in 1532, \"There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things.\" This seminar explores some of the ways in which leaders, particularly over the past two centuries, have arisen in a number of settings. How do we define greatness in leadership? Have the standards remained static, or have they changed over time? How have leaders overcome the obstacles in their paths? What, if any, traits do they have in common? Do leaders make the times in which they serve, or do the times dictate the leaders who emerge? Are leadership skills innate, or can they be learned and developed? The seminar will stimulate thinking through readings and discussion about notable figures from politics and government, such as the Founding Fathers, Lincoln, Mandela, Gandhi, and Churchill, while looking at contemporary examples drawn from the business and legal world as well. Readings include selections from biography, Confucius, Shakespeare, analysis and commentary, history, and autobiography. The seminar also features sessions with prominent figures from the business, media, and political worlds who will discuss their views and firsthand observations about leadership.    DIANE C. YU, ESQ. , is Chief of Staff and Deputy to the President of NYU. She has been a high-ranking executive at a Fortune 250 company, California judicial officer, general counsel for a California public corporation, and appointed by the President as a White House Fellow. Her B.A. is from Oberlin and her J.D. from the University of California at Berkeley. A national bar leader, she serves on numerous boards, has won awards for her service to the legal profession, and was the first woman of color to chair the American Bar Association's Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, which accredits American law schools. She currently chairs the ABA's Commission on Women in the Profession.    The Biology of Infectious Diseases (V50.0276; call # 72239) Instructors: Martin Blaser and Joel Ernst Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Infectious diseases have shaped human biology, genes, culture, and imagination. After the advent of antibiotics, we thought that we could win the \"war\" on infectious diseases. Antibiotic resistance and AIDS, among other events, have taught us that the war is not winnable. Rather, we must understand our place in the microbial world and learn to adapt strategies that minimize infectious disease impact, and maximize our symbiosis with indigenous organisms. After introductory discussions, the course is conducted as a series of seminars by students on topics that provide greater understanding of the underlying biological issues. Topics that may be discussed include genetic susceptibility to diseases such as malaria, problems involved in antibiotic resistance, the evolution of HIV, good microbes vs. bad, and infectious diseases in the postmodern world.    MARTIN BLASER is the Frederick H. King Professor of Internal Medicine and Chairman of the Department of Medicine, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A practicing physician and specialist in Infectious Diseases, he has progressively become a biologist. His research interests have spanned clinical medicine, epidemiology, molecular biology and genetics, evolutionary biology, mathematics, and history. The recipient of numerous honors and awards, he is founder and publisher of the Bellevue Literary Review.    JOEL ERNST is the Jeffrey Bergstein Professor of Medicine, Director of Infectious Diseases, and Professor of Microbiology at the NYU School of Medicine. A clinician and specialist in infectious diseases, he directs his immunology research at discovery of mechanisms used by microbial pathogens to evade the immune system. He is a frequently sought speaker at international meetings on infectious diseases and immunology.    Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Dueling with Scientific Health Information (V50.0278; call # 72241) Instructor: Ralph V. Katz Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    The common citizen is well challenged-if not overly challenged-trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \"Scientific\" health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \"scientific\" health findings of last week. As the movie theme song asked so poignantly 35 years ago, \"What's it all about, Alfie?\" This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \"instant, electronic news\" world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, polar bears, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \"op-ed\" article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.    RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He is Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton's 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master's degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.    W. E. B. Du Bois: The Making of a Radical Scholar-Activist (V50.0279; call # 72242) Instructor: Jeff Goodwin Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m.    W. E. B. Du Bois (1868-1963) was one of the most remarkable scholars and political activists of the 20th century. The first African-American to earn a doctorate at Harvard, Du Bois wrote perhaps the most trenchant analysis of the African-American condition, The Souls of Black Folk (1903), the first sociological study of a Black community, The Philadelphia Negro (1899), and one of the most influential works of American history, Black Reconstruction in America (1935). Du Bois also founded the Niagara Movement in 1905, breaking decisively with the \"accommodationist\" politics of Booker T. Washington, and was a major figure in the Pan-Africanist movement. This course examines the life, times, and writings of Du Bois, focusing on the years between his birth in 1868 in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, and 1910, when he left Atlanta University to become editor of The Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The course tries to understand, among other issues, how such a remarkable and cosmopolitan individual could have emerged from such a humble and seemingly parochial background, a small town in western Massachusetts with a tiny African-American community.    JEFF GOODWIN , Professor of Sociology , is the author of No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945-1991 and coeditor of Passionate Politics: Emotions and Social Movements and The Social Movements Reader. He has taught courses on social movements and revolutions at NYU since 1991. His interests also include social theory and the African-American tradition in sociology, including the works of Du Bois, Charles S. Johnson, E. Franklin Frazier, St. Claire Drake, and Oliver Cromwell Cox.    From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia (V50.0282; call # 72245) Instructor: Edward W. Lehman Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The new millennium has dawned with growing disenchantment with traditional left-right cleavages and with the claim that the United States is increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and its democratic institutions. Our aim is to assess the trajectory of our culture using the dimensions of autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. This seminar begins by probing these diagnoses in the broader context of moral and social transformations in the West over the last two thousand years. We examine social-science analyses of pivotal changes that have occurred in that period. We consider the sociologist Rodney Stark's highly acclaimed The Rise of Christianity, which focuses on developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era. Our final reading is the political scientist Robert Putnam's controversial Bowling Alone, which is currently the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life.    EDWARD W. LEHMAN is a Professor of Sociology . His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics, and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations. He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology, a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities. He is currently book review editor of The Responsive Community.    The Representation of \"the Other\" in the Israeli-Palestinian Cinema (V50.0286; call # 72249) Instructor: Shimon Dotan Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Representation of the Other is a variation of the search for self-identity. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its political cinema exhibit a clear pattern in which the parties attribute to the Other qualities and traits that reflect their own distress and aspirations. This pattern is examined in a series of contemporary films (1980 to the present). Each class consists of a screening followed by a discussion concentrating on representation in the context of the political conflict, variations in the use of film language to achieve a subjective portrayal, and modalities of representation and self-critique. Screenings include Divine Intervention, by Elia Suleiman; Beyond the Walls, by Uri Barabash; Close, Closed, Closure, by Ram Loevi; Wedding in the Galilee, by Michel Khleifi; and The Smile of the Lamb, by Shimon Dotan.    SHIMON DOTAN , a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with ten feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb) numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb) and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later). Dotan has taught filmmaking at Tel Aviv University in Israel and Concordia University in Montreal.    Communications and Human Values (V50.0291; call # 72254) Instructor: Richard D. Heffner Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar critically analyzes how much our sense of what it means to be an American at the dawn of the 21st century has been molded by the media, with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the power of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through discussion both of such readings as Walter Lippmann's Public Opinion, Robert Merton's Mass Persuasion, J. S. Mill's On Liberty, Herman Melville's Billy Budd, and Neil Postman's Amusing Ourselves to Death, and of such films as Birth of a Nation, 12 Angry Men, Hearts and Minds, and JFK. Finally, class emphasis is on such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \"chilling effect\" of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \"mobocracy\" with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).    RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind, which he began nearly a half century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York's pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952) and the editor of Tocqueville's Democracy in America (1956). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and, to be published in November 2004, the paperback edition of As They Saw It . . . A Half Century of Conversations from The Open Mind. From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry's voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.    Galileo and Hobbes (V50.0295; call # 72258) Instructor: William Klein Friday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    In 1636, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes visited the aged and blind Galileo at his house in Florence, but there is no record of what was said. That leaves us free to speculate as we enter into the works of these two great innovators and critics of the Aristotelian worldview. Using selections from both philosophers (and in those days there was often no difference between philosophers and scientists, except in terms of quality-Hobbes was a very good philosopher but perhaps not such a good scientist), we will try to decide whether Galileo would have approved of Hobbes's radical development of his physics and cosmology into a comprehensive philosophy of nature, human nature, and the state.    WILLIAM KLEIN is Visiting Professor of Humanities at NYU's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, on leave from the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he teaches the history of Western social thought. He specializes in early modern European legal and political thought but has also published, under a pen name, several mysteries for young adults.    The Crusades and Their Legacy (V50.0296; call # 72259) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    In the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters, if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. For two hundred years the Crusaders managed to hold on to their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. We study the differences among the religions as well as their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a holy war; the issue of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and Christian writings of the era, in translation, as well as secondary works.    JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively. She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.    Behind Government: How Politics, Media, and Money Shape Policies (V50.0298; call # 72261) Instructor: Mark Green Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    To read Congressional Records and State of the Union addresses, one might think that all policy emanated from facts, logic, and merit. And when Karl Rove, President Bush's top strategic adviser, said that the President doesn't consider politics when determining policy, it was a pleasant fiction no one was expected to believe. This seminar looks at the hidden aspects that drive government by focusing on five recent public leaders-President Bush (43), President Clinton, Mayor Giuliani, Ralph Nader, and former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. How did their varying styles, values, intellects, and personalities affect their offices or campaigns? Are there particular approaches that can best accomplish great goals? How do media and money affect the success of these powerful people? How much does the public actually know about those who govern them?    MARK GREEN was the Distinguished Visiting Lecturer at NYU Law School in 2002. The author/editor of 18 books (including Who Runs Congress?), he was the Consumer Affairs Commissioner of New York City (1990-93), the elected Public Advocate of New York City (1994-2001), and the Democratic nominee for Mayor (2001). He appears weekly on NY1's Wiseguys with Ed Koch and Al D'Amato.    Afghanistan and the World (V50.0300; call # 72263) Instructor: Robert D. McChesney Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Since September 11, Afghanistan has emerged as a country whose interests and future are linked in a major way with those of the United States. The United States is not the first country and probably not the last to find itself enmeshed in the politics and society of this small nation in central Asia. The seminar begins with the subject of Afghanistan's geophysical environment and the economic consequences that follow from that. Next it reviews the country's social and cultural features, with an emphasis on tribalism, religion, and the literary and artistic heritage. The geopolitics of Afghanistan are then considered in light of the preceding with emphasis on the country's relations with the nations that immediately surround it today-Pakistan, Iran, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China. Finally, the subject of Afghanistan in a global framework is discussed: Afghanistan's jihad against the Soviet Union, the civil war and the Taliban, and Afghanistan's relations with al-Qa'ida, the United States, and the United Nations.    ROBERT D. MCCHESNEY is Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , with a special interest in the early modern history of Iran and Central Asia. He is the author of Waqf in Central Asia (1991), Central Asia: Foundations of Change (1996), and Kabul under Siege (1999).    Law and Globalization (V50.0302; call # 72265) Instructor: Richard Stewart Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This seminar examines the role of law and legal institutions in fostering global market integration and economic growth and in addressing the discontents of globalization. The globalization of the economy has brought many benefits, but also many problems and criticisms. These discontents include disparities in power and wealth between rich and poor, which many claim have been exacerbated by globalization; lack of participation and transparency in decision-making by the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and other international organizations; marginalization of developing-country interests; cultural homogenization and displacement of local political and economic self-determination; loosening of social safety nets and regulatory protection; and subordination of environmental, labor, and human rights concerns. These discontents, and the law's response to them, are examined critically. Topics include the role of contract, trade, and financial law in promoting international markets; the role of international treaties and organizations in managing the global economy, its benefits, and its adverse impacts; international environmental, labor, and human rights laws; how law affects the distribution of the burdens and benefits of globalization in areas such as intellectual property and trade/environment controversies; the role of multinational corporations and the global corporate social responsibility movement; the concerns of indigenous peoples; and the role of non-government organizations and the \"democracy deficit\" in global governance.    RICHARD B. STEWART is University Professor and John Edward Sexton Professor of Law. He also directs the Center on Environmental and Land Use Law. His teaching and research focus on domestic and international environmental law, the role of economic incentives in environmental protection, law and globalization, and administrative law and regulation.

He previously served as Assistant Attorney General for Environment and Natural Resources of the U.S. Department of Justice and as a faculty member at Harvard Law School and Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.    Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? (V50.0306; call # 72269) Instructor: Jorge G. Casta?eda TBA    This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America's problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.    JORGE G. CASTA?EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies . Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

From the Birth of Tragedy to the Birth of Pleasure (V50.0309; call # 72272) Instructor: Carol Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    The Birth of Tragedy symbolized by the story of Oedipus has long been linked with the birth of Western civilization. In this seminar, we will examine this linkage and also a tradition of resistance that extends from Greek tragedy through 19th-century fugitive slave narratives to the liberation movements of the late 20th century and postcolonial fiction. The Birth of Pleasure picks up this tradition of resistance and shows its psychological roots in studies of infancy, research with adolescent girls and young boys, and the findings of neuroscience. Knowing a tragic story, how do we keep from repeating it? Readings will be drawn from psychology and literature, and students will write short weekly reflection papers as well as a final paper.    CAROL GILLIGAN came to NYU as a University Professor in 2002. For the preceding 34 years she was on the faculty of Harvard University, where her award-winning research on gender and human development led to the creation of Harvard's first professorship in gender studies. Her 1982 book, In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development, has been translated into 17 languages. Her most recent book, The Birth of Pleasure, was published last year.    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V50.0311; call # 74825) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    The U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court's interpretation and application of the Constitution, and the Court's new, self-defined role, have adversely affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \"Imperial Judiciary.\" Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them, and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis, the Court's participation in the debate, and the effect that nine people appointed for life (the justices) have on how we live. Topics include abortion, euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights, gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; affirmative action; college speech codes, including \"hate\" speech, verbal sexual harassment, group liable and symbolic speech; prayer in school and students' right of privacy; and racial and ethnic profiling, government's right to detain accused terrorists, and the USA PATRIOT Act. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the political spectrum.    ALAN J. POMERANTZ, ESQ ., is a practicing lawyer and partner of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, LLP, a major international law firm.

Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History (V50.0312; call # 74826) Instructor: Marion Kaplan Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.    This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social, and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, memoirs and diaries disclose the private aspects of everyday life, revealing crucial concealed thoughts and emotions as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with the most famous memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher-bohemian-heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Readings from the period of the Holocaust include two classics, the diaries of Anne Frank, a young girl, and Victor Klemperer, an elderly Jewish man. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor includes introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class.    MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History . She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J?discher Frauenbund, 1904-1938 (1979), The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany (1991), and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany (1998).

She has edited books on European women's history-When Biology Became Destiny: Women in Weimar and Nazi Germany and The Marriage Bargain: Dowries in European History-and is currently editing and writing a history of Jewish daily life from the 17th century until 1945.    German Romantic Music, 1815-1850 (V50.0313; call # 74827) Instructor: Robert Bailey Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.    Many artists of this period revolted against prevailing artistic, and even social and political, institutions. They reacted against both the current cult of the virtuoso and the increasingly commercial climate dominated by music publishers. They withdrew into a private artistic world, and the Artist became the typical Romantic hero. The Wanderer in turn became the ideal symbolic projection of an artist alienated from a society uninterested in his work and in his welfare. This withdrawal led artists to participate in a private symbolic system accessible to themselves, but only partly accessible to middle-class audiences. German artists often restructured traditional relationships and affinities among the musical, poetic, and visual arts. Unable to find fulfillment in the troublesome present, they frequently sought vindication for their artistic ideals in the past. Hence, their interest in folksong, which inspired a large body of new poetry appropriate for musical setting. Such poetry provided the foundation for a flowering of song publications, which flourished alongside popular publications of actual folksongs. Opera, the song cycle, and the multi-movement piano cycle are the genres that most fully project the intricate system of interlocking and closely aligned musical, poetic, and visual imagery. The works in these genres by Weber, Schubert, Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Schumann, and Wagner are of central concern to the seminar.    ROBERT BAILEY is the Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor of Music in the Faculty of Arts and Science. As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, he majored in music and German. He then studied piano at the Academy of Music in Munich. He did his graduate work in musicology at Princeton, where his principal mentors were Oliver Strunk and Milton Babbitt. He also continued piano study with Edward Steuermann, who was on the faculty of the Juilliard School. Before joining the faculty of NYU in 1986, he taught at Yale and at the Eastman School of Music.    Opium and China (V50.0314; call # 74828) Instructor: Joanna Waley-Cohen Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar highlights opium's material and symbolic role in China's history before and after the Opium Wars of the 19th century. Using both primary and secondary courses, it explores such issues as opium's economic role within China and in the global market; the nature and extent of addiction in China; global attitudes to opium use; the role of Chinese middlemen and consumers in the extraordinarily rapid spread of opium in China; and ways in which opium both complemented and changed perceptions of gender, in terms of drug use as well as in terms of foreign perceptions of China, since opium came to serve in complicated ways as a symbol for China itself.    JOANNA WALEY-COHEN is the author of The Sextants of Beijing: Global Currents in Chinese History (1999) and Exile in Mid-Qing China: Banishment to Xinjiang, 1759-1820 (1991), as well as numerous articles on Chinese legal history, the military culture of the Qing empire, and the history of Hong Kong. Her current project is on gastronomy and gluttony in early modern China. Since 1992 she has taught a range of undergraduate and graduate courses in Chinese history at NYU, most recently on material culture, on the Silk Roads, on Qing history, and on interactions with Europe and the wider world.    Sport, Race, Ethnicity, and Gender in 20th-Century America (V50.0315; call # 74967) Instructor: Peter Levine Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    Although you may well learn why Nat Holman is in the Basketball Hall of Fame, why Ralph Branca cried in l951, or who Senda Berenson was, this seminar is not concerned with preparing you for sports trivia contests. Rather, its central purpose is to explore how race, ethnicity, gender, and class have influenced the development of organized sport as a major social and cultural institution of American life. During the first part of the semester we will collectively explore readings and films that touch on these themes. Later, we will devote considerable time learning how to write a major research paper, using both secondary and primary sources, including oral histories. Where possible and practical, students will be encouraged to make use of New York as a site for investigation and research.    PETER LEVINE was for many years Professor of American History and Director of American Studies at Michigan State University, before returning to his native Brooklyn in 2000. Whether focusing on ethnic studies or on popular culture, he has been especially attracted to interdisciplinary approaches and to reaching out to both scholarly and popular audiences. Best known for his work in sport and American social history, he is the author of Ellis Island to Ebbets Field: Sport and the American Jewish Experience (1992), A. G. Spalding and the Rise of Baseball (1985), and, with Robert Lipsyte, Idols of the Game (1995).    Latin American Nobel Prize Winners (V50.0316; call # 74966) Instructor: Mary Louise Pratt Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.    Prerequisite: ability to understand spoken and written Spanish This course is aimed at students who have a strong background in Spanish and enjoy studying literature. We will study the lives and works of the five writers who have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: the Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral (1942), the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Angel Asturias (1967), the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda (1971), the Colombian novelist Gabriel Garc?a M?rquez (1982), and the Mexican poet Octavio Paz (1990). In addition, we will look at the work of three writer-activists who have won the Nobel Peace Prize: the Costa Rican Oscar Arias (1987), the Argentine Adolfo Perez Esquivel (1980), and the Guatemalan Rigoberta Mench? (1992).We will study these writers in their Latin American context, and consider what it was about them that drew international attention. Reading their acceptance speeches, we will ask how they sought to negotiate the place of Latin America in the international imagination, and how their work was received at home and abroad. At the textual level, especially with poetic texts, we will compare different translations, as a way of exploring the use of language. Class and readings will be mainly in Spanish; class participation and written work may be in Spanish or English. The course will count toward the Spanish or Latin American Studies major.    MARY LOUISE PRATT , Silver Professor of Latin American Literature and Culture , is an eminent scholar in the field of Latin American culture. During the year 2003, she served as President of the Modern Language Association. She is the author of, among many other titles, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation, \"I Rigoberta Mench? and the Culture Wars,\" and \"Apocalypse in the Andes: Contact Zones and the Struggles for Interpretive Power.\"    From Mycenae to the Acropolis: Greek History and Art (V50.0317; call # 74965) Instructor: Guenter Kopcke Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This class aims at an understanding of the first thousand years of Greece's-and hence Western-political history. By the end of the fifth century B.C. the product (at least in Athens) is the individual familiar to us-the self-aware citizen, knowingly responsible for his or her actions. Greek art begins in the second millennium as a weapon of last resort of the disadvantaged in a lawless social climate. In the first millennium, as strife was progressively resolved by sparring with mental means rather than with physical force, the outline of a rationally controllable world emerges. That, in essence, will be seen as giving meaning to early Greek history and art. Demonstration will rely mostly on the contemporary mind and experience in reading (analyzing) primary evidence.    GUENTER KOPCKE is the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities at NYU's Institute of Fine Arts. Before coming to this country, he served as Assistant Curator in Munich, taught at the University of Zurich, and participated in many excavations in Greece and Israel. In outlook more historian than archaeologist or art historian, he is interested chiefly in understanding the critical role of (visual) art in the image of man in the Western tradition. His fields of concentration are the first thousand years of this tradition, from the middle of the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium B.C.    The Many Faces of Shahrazad: Arab Women in Culture, Literature, and 20th-Century Film (V50.0318; call # 74957) Instructor: Mona N. Mikhail Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.    This seminar introduces students to the role and status of women in Arab societies today. Through the examination of selected texts from a variety of sources, be they sacred or profane, students investigate the role of the religious, social, and cultural as well as the political in the formation of the lives and roles of contemporary Arab women. Whether in Qur'anic suras or tales from the Thousand and One Nights, contemporary Arab-American poets or novelists from the Arab world, the course assesses the traditional gender roles versus the rapidly changing status of women. Close readings of selected essays, poems, novels, and short fiction, written by both women and men, as well as the viewing of selected films and documentaries, seek to address some of these timely topics.    MONA N. MIKHAIL , Associate Professor of Middle Eastern Studies , is the author of numerous books, notably Studies in the Short Fiction of Naguib Mahfouz and Yusuf Idris, and has written extensively on the cultural, social, and political context of modern Arabic literature, while also translating several important Arabic works into English. She is currently working on the growing body of women's literature in the Arab world and exploring women's role in popular culture/literature in oral genres such as proverbs, drama, song, and humor. Her latest work, Seen and Heard, was published in spring 2004. She also recently directed and produced a documentary about the theater in Egypt.    Recycling Music: from Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop (V50.0319; call # 74829) Instructor: Rena Charnin Mueller Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    In 1953, the Russian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions in the musical Kismet. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin's oeuvre to construct the score. This is one of many instances in which musicians and composers of the 20th century have reached back into the past for inspiration, whether of direct musical content, instrumental forces, or literary material, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and the popular idiom. This class examines representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage (Kismet, Anya, Rent, Aida), ballet (Le Spectre de la Rose and any number of Chopin favorites), film (Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan; Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Eric Carmen, \"All by Myself,\" \"Never Gonna Fall in Love Again\"). After a brief introduction to the concepts of musical transference and parody in music, classes compare original \"classical\" compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music, and examine the kinds of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to the later incarnation. Also considered is the cross-over between classical composers/conductors and the popular music scene.    RENA CHARNIN MUELLER is a musicologist specializing in 19th-century music. Her work on Liszt's compositional aesthetic has appeared in various journals. Her most recent publication is an essay on the Liszt lieder in the Cambridge Companion to the Lied (2004). She has published new editions of Les Pr?ludes (1997), Trois ?tudes de Concert (1996) and the two Ballades (1996); and her edition of the newly discovered Liszt Walse was published in 1996. With M?ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Franz Liszt \"List of Works\" for The New Grove 2000, and they are also co-authoring the new Franz Liszt Thematischer Verzeichnis (forthcoming). In 2003 she was a winner of the College's Outstanding Teaching Award.    Lost and Found in Translation (V50.0320; call # 75132) Instructor: Kathleen Ross Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.    Although we are not always aware of it, the process of translation figures prominently in our daily lives. Understanding another person's speech or writing is an act of translation, even when we speak the \"same\" language; according to some linguistic theories, all language is ultimately a translation. Translation, throughout history, has often been portrayed as an inevitable loss, a violence done to one language by another; the translator is characterized as a traitor, an imperialist, a thief, and the translation as only a pale copy of the \"original.\" Yet translation is crucial to the expansion of our sense of self in relation to an \"Other,\" and we cannot live fully without it. This course first examines some basic history and theories of translation, then considers the question of what is \"lost\" and what is \"found\" in the process, taking up examples from various historical moments. Throughout the course we will make use of multiple English translations of texts to spark our thinking. No knowledge of a language besides English is necessary.    KATHLEEN ROSS is Associate Professor of Spanish in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese , where she has served as Director of Undergraduate Studies and as Chair. She is both a scholar of the Latin American colonial period and an active translator of 19- and 20th-century Spanish American essays, poetry, and fiction. She has published translations of works by C?sar Vallejo, Roque Dalton, Julieta Campos, and others. Her translation of Domingo F. Sarmiento's classic 1845 essay Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism was published by the University of California Press in 2004.    Travelers and Travelogues in History (V50.0321; call # 75111) Instructor: Zvi Ben-Dor Benite Monday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.    This seminar uses travelogues-journals and memoirs written by travelers-as historical sources. We will read several travelogues written by different travelers from different periods and learn to devise ways and methods to interrogate them for the purpose of historical inquiry. During the course we will try to answer several questions such as: Who are the authors of the travelogues and what can we learn about them from their texts? How do they describe the societies and landscapes they visit and what can we learn from the travelogues? Most importantly, we will try to come up with a list of many other questions the answers for which can be found in travelogues. The travelogues selected for this seminar stretch over different periods and cover different regions of the world such as Asia, Africa, and Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the Early Modern period. We will read travel stories by, among others, Benjamin of Tudela, Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, and Olaudah Equiano.    ZVI BEN-DOR BENITE is Assistant Professor of History . His specialty is world history, specifically the relations between East Asia, West Asia, and Europe during the Middle Ages and the early modern periods. He is the author of The Dao of Muhammad: A Cultural History of Muslims in Late Imperial China.    Staging Shakespeare's Comedies (V50.0322; call # 75380) Instructor: Peter W. Meineck Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.    This course examines the comedic work of William Shakespeare, focusing specifically on five major works-The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, and The Tempest. The course involves a practical element where students discuss staging, performance, interpretation, and the meaning of these works today. Class members are expected to participate in active workshops and dramatic explorations, although they do not need to have any performing experience; these practical workshops are designed to be purely exploratory and not performative. In addition to practical work, this course studies Shakespeare's influences, examining the origin of comedy, the theater of ancient Greece and Rome, including the works of Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, and Terence, traditional English comedic forms, and Elizabethan satire, culture, and politics. It also considers the influence of Shakespearean comedy on successive dramatic forms, including the theater, film, and television. Students interested in this course should be prepared actively and intelligently to participate in discussions and practical workshops and follow a good amount of reading.    PETER W. MEINECK is Clinical Assistant Professor of Classics and Ancient Studies at NYU and the Artistic Director of the Aquila Theatre Company, a New York and national professional theater group specializing in fresh and innovative productions of classical drama, especially Shakespeare. Recently the Aquila's Othello formed the main focus of the National Endowment for the Arts' Shakespeare in American Communities program.

He has been teaching at NYU for the past five years and has also held academic appointments at Princeton and Harvard, among other U.S. universities. He is originally from London, England.    Before Cleopatra: Royal Women of Ancient Egypt (V50.0323; call # 75381) Instructor: Ann Macy Roth Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 noon    Long before Cleopatra, the royal women of ancient Egypt often had a great deal of influence on world events. Some even became pharaohs in their own right, and were depicted with a beard and a male body or wearing the ceremonial dress of a king over the modest traditional dress of a woman. Others exercised religious authority in priestly offices or as the ceremonial wife of a god. This course examines the lives and roles of these women, as reflected in the art, archaeology, and texts of their own times, and often in their own words. Questions examined include the assumptions about gender and sex underlying Egyptian culture, the practical and symbolic roles of queens, the character of women's monuments, the destruction of some monuments of powerful women by later generations, and changes in the roles of elite women over almost three millennia of Egyptian history. Through their culturally anomalous position, we come to understand some important principles of gender and power in Egypt, and perhaps elsewhere as well. In addition, we examine the views of these women taken by Western scholars and popular media, and how such understandings of their roles reflect the evolution of our own cultural attitudes.    ANN MACY ROTH is Clinical Associate Professor in the Departments of Hebrew and Judaic Studies and Fine Arts . Her research focuses mainly on the earlier periods of ancient Egyptian culture, particularly mortuary traditions and the roles of gender and sexuality in Egyptian society. She is director of the Giza Cemetery Project, and since 1987 has conducted archaeological research in the officials' tombs to the west of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Her publications include Egyptian Phyles of the Old Kingdom: The Evolution of a System of Social Organization, A Cemetery of Palace Attendants at Giza, and numerous articles. She has been invited to write three essays for Daughter of Re: Hatshepsut, King of Egypt, the catalogue of an exhibition opening in spring 2006 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.    Making Choices in Contemporary America: Dedication, Deception, and Deals (V50.0324; call # 74964) Instructor: Frederick G. More Tuesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.    Have you ever done what you thought was the right thing only do find yourself feeling that your right choice left you at a disadvantage? This course uses a case-study approach to reflect on issues in bioethics and contemporary life. Examples include such cases as that of Erin Brockovich, whose routine work in a law office led to the discovery of injustices suffered by citizens in a California city; a family who wanted to remove their daughter from life support, after years in a persistent vegetative state, only to become the focus of a legal controversy that reached the Supreme Court; the research project in which for 40 years U.S. Public Health Service researchers deprived 600 black men with syphilis of their right to health care; the Reagan administration's denial of the HIV epidemic in the U.S.; and the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendations about nutrition that resulted from an intensely partisan process and deal-making. During the course we use movies, books, articles, and self-study as vehicles for reflection about the personal values that one can employ for decision-making and for exploration of personal and medical ethics.    FREDERICK G. MORE is Professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion and the Department of Pediatric Dentistry in the NYU College of Dentistry.

By Any Means Necessary: Presidential Politics in the Post-Watergate Era (V50.0325; call # 74963) Instructor: Cheryl Mills Wednesday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.    Since Watergate, the policy agenda of the presidency has become increasingly defined not just by the ideas of the individual holding office but by the tactical allegations and actions of forces external to the White House. Today, a president's agenda gains support or faces opposition from governmental forces-in the executive branch, Congress, and the judiciary-and nongovernmental forces, including political parties, special-interest groups, think tanks, political action organizations, and the media. It has become commonplace for all parties, including the president and his staff, to seek to accomplish their public policy aims by engaging in the politics of obstruction and personal attack to undermine confidence in the opposition's agenda for America. From election campaigns to presidential appointments to impeachment to the exercise of war powers, the president and his political opposition must be adept at navigating the politics of personal destruction. This class studies presidential politics since Watergate. It examines the presidency in relation to its governmental counterparts, the judiciary and Congress, as well as to the nongovernmental entities. Using media accounts (electronic, print, and televised), congressional and judicial testimony, judicial decisions, historical accounts, and first-person narratives, it assesses the players, the methods, and the impact on the presidency of public policy dissent and disagreement by any means necessary.    CHERYL MILLS, ESQ. , is Senior Vice President and Counselor for Operations and Administration at NYU. She received the J.D. from Stanford Law School, where she was elected to the Stanford Law Review. In the Clinton administration she served as Deputy Counsel to the President at the White House, where she supervised 35 attorneys and staff. She gained national prominence for her defense of President Clinton during the 1999 Senate impeachment trial. From 1999 to 2001, before joining NYU, she was Senior Vice President for Corporate Policy and Public Programming at Oxygen Media. She serves on the boards of numerous foundations, schools, and corporations.    Vienna 1900: The Art and Culture of Viennese Modernism (V50.0326; call # 75378) Instructor: Guy Walton Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30-1:45 p.m.    At the turn of the 20th century, Vienna, the capital of the Austrian Empire, became an important center of \"modern\" architecture, art, applied arts, music, philosophy, and science (particularly medicine/psychiatry). After a brief survey of the geography and history of the Austrian Empire and description of the city of Vienna, the course examines a selection of the major monuments of Vienna, especially those related to European modernism, and five operas. The focus is thus on art, architecture, and music, stressing the relationship of these to the cultural and intellectual milieu of this splendid capital city. Among the artists to be studied are Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Adolf Loos, Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, and Richard Strauss. New York museums, commercial art galleries, and the new Neue Galerie provide an important resource for the seminar.    GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Fine Arts in the College of Arts and Science. He received his Ph.D. from NYU's Institute of Fine Arts and is well known for his publications on the art of the royal courts of Europe, particularly those of France, Sweden, and Russia. He is also a collector of 20th-century Austrian decorative arts.    The Politics of Judicial Decision-Making (V50.0327; call # 75128) Instructor: Anna Harvey Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    This seminar is about how we can and should understand how U.S. Supreme Court justices decide cases. We begin by posing the problem of the countermajoritarian Court. Given the apparent absence of mechanisms to hold the justices accountable to popular preferences, can we come up with rules of statutory and constitutional interpretation that constrain the justices' decisions in normatively desirable ways? We review several of these theories of interpretation. What do they prescribe? How constraining would they be in practice? Would they in fact lead to better outcomes? We then turn to work that seeks to determine what the justices are actually doing when they decide cases. We first examine the justices' decisions in cases involving statutory interpretation. We then examine their decisions in constitutional cases. What kinds of data are used in these studies? What are their conclusions? How believable are they? Is the Court really countermajoritarian? Finally, we return to the normative theories with which we started. Given what we have learned from the positive work on the Court, do they still have any relevance?    ANNA HARVEY is Associate Professor of Politics . She received her Ph.D. from Princeton University. Having joined the Department of Politics in 1994, she served as its chair from 2000 to 2003. She is the author of Votes without Leverage: Women in American Electoral Politics, 1920-1970, as well as of many scholarly articles. Her research focuses on two areas: the nature of partisanship in the American electorate and the political constraints on judicial decision-making. In the latter project, she and her collaborator at NYU's Law School are investigating the extent to which the Supreme Court is constrained by the political branches in constitutional cases.    Charity, Philanthropy, and the Nonprofit Sector (V50.0328; call # 75379) Instructors: Harvey P. Dale and Jill S. Manny Wednesday, 3:30-5:30 p.m.    This course explores the nonprofit sector and its role in society, from a perspective that touches on legal, economic, policy, and other realms. After a look at the history and scope of the nonprofit sector, we discuss the burdens and benefits of philanthropy and the nonprofit sector. We consider how charities derive resources and how they expend them to further their charitable purposes. We examine the distinction between public charities and private foundations, and invite leaders of both sorts of charities to join us in class for a discussion. We discuss governance of charities, both by federal and state regulators and by officers, directors, and trustees. We focus on the things that the nonprofit sector does well, and some of its performance failures, as we consider recent publicized scandals and abuses within the sector and estimate their impact on the sector. We analyze relevant legal concepts and theories, including the rules for tax exemption and tax deductions, and consider why these benefits are offered to certain organizations. We also consider those who donate their time and resources, examining both donor motivation and donor intent. Finally, we discuss nonprofit speech viewed through the lens of legal restrictions on lobbying and political campaign activities by nonprofits.    HARVEY P. DALE is University Professor of Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. Since 1988 he has been Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law at NYU. The Founding President of The Atlantic Philanthropies, he has also served as board member of or consultant to a wide range of other nonprofit organizations and institutions. He is the author of numerous publications on philanthropy and the law. JILL S. MANNY joined the faculty at NYU School of Law in 1993, where she teaches courses on Nonprofit Law, Tax-Exempt Organizations, and Tax Aspects of Charitable Giving. In 1995 she assumed there the additional position of Executive Director of the National Center on Philanthropy and the Law. She also teaches Nonprofit Law at NYU's Wagner School of Public Service.    Extra-solar Planets and Astrobiology (V50.0329; call # 75382) Instructor: Glennys Farrar Monday, 4:55-7:25    Questions about the existence of other planets and about life on those planets have been with us since the dawn of time. Since the realization that not only the Earth but the other planets of our solar system orbit the Sun and that life on Earth depends on sunlight, mankind has searched for more planets in our own solar system and for planets orbiting other stars. In the last ten years these searches have finally succeeded. The search for and study of other planetary systems is now a major theme of current astrophysics research. This course introduces that work, exploring why searching for planets is so difficult and why it finally succeeded. It presents an overview of cosmology and star formation, to see how stars \"work\" and why planets around other stars would be expected to be common. By contrast, the scientific study of the origin and evolution of life (astrobiology) is an emerging discipline, with quite different ideas on how widespread life may be in the universe. This state of affairs gives students a chance to observe a new scientific discipline in its formative period, and to understand how scientists go about posing and refining questions, even when there are many more questions than answers and it is not yet clear how to formulate the fundamental problems.    GLENNYS FARRAR is Professor of Physics and Director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at NYU. Before coming to NYU in 1998, she was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and on the faculties of the California Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. Her current work focuses mainly on problems at the intersection of astrophysics, cosmology, and particle physics, including ultrahigh energy cosmic rays, the nature of dark matter and dark energy, and the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter.    Departmental Seminars Available for Freshmen       Freshman Colloquium: Borges, the Storyteller (V95.0250, sec. 001; call # 74352) Instructor: Sylvia Molloy Tuesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    This seminar, conducted in Spanish, has two goals: to read the work of the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges and to reflect on narrative, specifically, on storytelling. Why do we tell stories? How do we put them together in order to achieve the desired results? Are stories \"just\" fiction? Is history \"just\" a story? What about autobiography? What power do storytellers have over us and why do we listen to them? Why do we call them fabricators and, at the same time, say that their stories ring true? A master narrator, Borges resorts to storytelling in all the genres he practices-short fiction, principally, but also essays and poetry. A close reading of his work allows us not only to reflect on the question of narrative but also, more importantly, to enjoy the pleasure of the written text. Readings include Borges's Ficciones , El Aleph , El informe de Brodie , and Antologia poetica .    Freshman Colloquium: Nueva York (V95.0250, sec. 002; call # 74353) Instructor: James Fern?ndez Wednesday, 2:00-4:40 p.m. Prerequisite: score of 4 or 5 on Spanish AP examination or permission of the director of undergraduate studies.    Through the analysis of a series of essays, short stories, novels, plays, and films, this course explores (1) New York as an important site of production of Spanish-language culture from the early 19th century to the present and (2) representations of New York in Spanish-language culture during that same period. Readings include Jos? Mart? (Cuba), Cr?nicas de Nueva York ; Federico Garc?a Lorca (Spain), Poeta en Nueva York ; Rene Marqu?s (Puerto Rico), La carreta ; Ernesto Qui?onez (Ecuador), El vendedor de sue?os ; Antonio Mu?oz Molina (Spain), and Ventanas de Manhattan. The course is conducted in Spanish.                        Welcome!

The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.  Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210; class # 6771 Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on twentieth-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.  The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218; class # 6772 Instructor: John E. Sexton Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level. JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.  First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235; class # 6773   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon  syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Prerequisites: A score of 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History or in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam); a 4 or 5 on both exams (or equivalent international exams) is strongly recommended. Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions of speech and press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course, which involves study of both history and law, begins by examining the robust debate and dissent during the founding period and the struggle during that time against prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court gave meaning to the freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, where he teaches First Amendment freedom of expression. He is working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.  School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255; class # 6774   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader. ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.  Spring 2014 The Politics of Knowledge FRSEM-UA 277; class # 14596 Instructor: Thomas Bender  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. N ote: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Knowledge is power, it is said. If that is true, is there a politics of knowledge? In academe, knowledge is often contested. Is knowledge only political? What is the difference between \u201copinion\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d? The university is organized around disciplines. What is the role of academic disciplines? How is knowledge validated? Do all disciplines have the same criteria for knowledge? Are there different kinds of knowledge? Are there incommensurable knowledges? Do artists, humanists, and scientists understand knowledge and knowledge claims differently? Are visual, numerical, narrative, and analytical forms of knowing/interpreting all forms of knowledge? What is the relation of interpretation to knowledge? Is all knowledge interpretive? Is some interpretive, and other not? Is there a way to determine that some knowledge claims are truer than others? The seminar proceeds by reading and discussion and weekly \u201cresponses\u201d to readings, critical two-page papers related to some of the readings, and a short research paper. THOMAS BENDER is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History. On the faculty since 1974, he has served as chair of the History Department and Dean for the Humanities. His teaching and research interests cover the history of cities, intellectuals and cultural history more generally.

Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History FRSEM-UA 312; class # 14334 Instructor: Marion Kaplan  syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.) This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, these ego-documents reveal crucial concealed thoughts and emotions, as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with a memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher/bohemian/heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Students will study a variety of readings from the period of the Holocaust. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor assigns introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class. MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY.

Recycling Music: From Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop FRSEM-UA 319; class # 18467 Instructor: Rena Mueller  syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Sixty years ago the musical Kismet opened on Broadway, and the Russian post-Wagnerian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named as the co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin\u2019s oeuvre to construct the score, something they had done before (successfully, in The Song of Norway , to the music of Grieg) and would do again (unsuccessfully, in Anya , music by Rachmaninoff). These are among the many instances in which musicians and composers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have reached back into the past for inspiration, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and popular music. We examine representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage ( Rent, Aida ), ballet, film ( Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Alicia Keys, Eric Carmen, All By Myself, Never Gonna Fall in Love Again , Procol Harum). After a brief introduction to the concept of musical transference and the concept of parody in music (Bach, Mozart), students compare original \u201cclassical\u201d compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music and film, and examine the culture of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to its later incarnation. Classical composers/conductors and artists who were critical to this movement are also considered.  RENA CHARNIN MUELLER teaches historical musicology at New York University. She is the recipient of the Liszt Medal given by the American Liszt Society for 2011, and edited the Journal of the American Liszt Society from 2001 to 2011.

With M\u00e1ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Liszt \u201cList of Works\u201d for The New Grove 2001 , and together they are preparing a complete thematic catalogue of Liszt\u2019s music.  Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355; class # 6780 Instructor: John Maynard  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present. They learn to consider different approaches to literature. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome: Michelangelo and Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366; class # 8250 Instructor: Guy Walton  syllabus  Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Recent biographies of Michelangelo by John Spike (Young Michelangelo) and by Antonio Forcellino (Michelangelo a Tormented Life) , and of Caravaggio by Andrew Graham-Dixon (Caravaggio, a Life Sacred and Profane) , will provide the focus of this course along with contemporary writings. The course will study the remarkable papal patronage of the arts of Rome during the reigns of a number of popes, including Sixtus IV, Alexander VI, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, Clement VIII and Paul V along with other patrons close to the papal court at the time. GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles .  The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367; class # 8119 Instructor: Vincent Passaro Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy. VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, The Nation, the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.  Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371; class # 6781 Instructor: Carol Sternhell  syllabus  Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. CAROL STERNHELL, the Department of Journalism\u2019s former Associate Chair, is Associate Professor of Journalism and a director of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute\u2019s new multimedia Studio 20 graduate program. As the department\u2019s former Director of Global Initiatives, she created study-abroad programs in London, Prague, and Accra. She was the founding Director of the College\u2019s women\u2019s studies major (now Gender and Sexuality Studies) and has written about feminism, motherhood, and literature for a variety of publications, including the Village Voice, The Nation, the New York Times Book Review, Ms., and the Women\u2019s Review of Books .

She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005. The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379; class # 6782 Instructor: Michael E. Makover  syllabus  Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester. MICHAEL E. MAKOVER is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine, Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center, and in active practice of internal medicine and rheumatology. He is particularly interested in preventive medicine and has published on new approaches to preventing nearly all heart disease and stroke. He is the author of the book Mismanaged Care , as well as articles on healthcare quality, ethics, and economics. He is the Chief Medical Officer for a major union. A co-founder and director of a medical device and telehealth company, he has also been a consultant to many corporations. He was an aide to Senator Robert F. Kennedy and a spokesman for the American Cancer Society and the New York Heart Association. He is developing a book called 120 Years Young .  Computational Thought FRSEM-UA 385; class # 6784 Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30-4:30 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a biography about great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over sixty journal papers, seventy conference papers, and fifteen patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American . Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393; class # 6785 Instructor: Michele Shedlin  syllabus  Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This guides our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort. MICHELE SHEDLIN, Professor at the NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care. Dr. Shedlin is currently involved in NIH-funded research on HIV risk for Colombian refugees in Ecuador, medication adherence among US\u2013Mexico border populations, acculturation and HIV risk for sexual minority populations and post-Katrina Latino migrant workers in New Orleans. She maintains adjunct faculty appointments at Columbia University, University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Connecticut. Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.  Spring 2014 Word and Image FRSEM-UA 399; class # 7942 Instructor: Mark Podwal  syllabus  Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem \u201cI Paint What I See\u201d parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and A Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits are assigned. MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For thirty-eight years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books, as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast in 2008 and 2010 on PBS.  America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405; class # 6786 Instructor: James B. Sitrick  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than sixty-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in America during which time that firm opened the first private law office in the then Soviet Union, in Moscow, in addition to offices in Sydney, Shanghai, Bangkok, Jakarta, Los Angeles, and San Jose. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as Secretary General of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a Trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU. Is Karl Marx Still Relevant? FRSEM-UA 413; class # 14944 Instructor: Jeff Goodwin  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, students in this course critically examine some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto, The German Ideology, The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current U.S. politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. His has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader, Contention in Context, Passionate Politics, and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422; class # 6787 Instructor: Richard L. Lewis  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Brands are red hot and understanding branding is, too. Just what is it and why do people now want to possess personal brands? And what exactly is a brand, say, versus a product? Brands can be magical, prosaic, living or dead. And while companies manicure them it\u2019s up to us, the audience, to determine if they are successful. Brands can be great time-savers: it\u2019s reassuring a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust. They provide information, advice, smiles, and community. They live, breathe, grow, and sometimes (deservedly) die. Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even the brand owners sometimes don\u2019t really know what the glue is that cements the relationships with their audiences. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, the ingredients, the evolution\u2014how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and presidents. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. The course will also examine our budding, personal brands because through our reputations\u2014or brands\u2014our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us. How are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own brands? Branding is a course that provides insight into our everyday lives. Consider it a marketing course for the rest of us. RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/ Day, leading the ABSOLUT Vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.  The Science and Policy of Climate Change FRSEM-UA 432; class # 15018 Instructor: Edwin Gerber  syllabus  Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Hurricane Sandy. The Keystone XL pipeline. Fracking. The topic of climate change continues to inject itself into headlines, despite the reluctance of Washington to have a genuine conversation on the topic. Climate change provokes heated argument not only because of the great environmental, economic, and political implications, but also how it injects itself into our daily lives on such a personal level, impacted each time we flip a switch, decide what's for dinner, or connect on Facebook. Each Google search adds roughly 0.2 grams of carbon to the atmosphere; a harmless sounding number, except for the fact that collectively the world makes about 5 billion searches each day ... and that number is growing fast! To help you make informed decisions about climate change, this course explores the science of global warming. We investigate the evidence from observations and the physical and mathematical foundations upon which forecasts of future climate are based. What are the key uncertainties in the predictions, and what steps are required to reduce them? Armed with this scientific basis, you then conduct your own research project on the economic and policy side of climate change, giving you a chance to enter the debate, and perhaps contribute to the solution! EDWIN GERBER is a Professor of Atmosphere-Ocean Science at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. His research focuses on the natural variability of the Earth's atmosphere (for example, why are some winters so cold and snowy compared to others?) and the role it plays in the response of the climate system to anthropogenic (human) forcing. More recently he has investigated how the formation of the ozone hole changed the circulation of the Southern Hemisphere, with possible implications for the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets and global sea level rise. Trials of the Century FRSEM-UA 434; class # 6789 Instructor: Jack Ford  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the Scottsboro Boys, will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the Chicago Seven. And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes Monkey Trial. Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law. JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, Mr. Ford most recently served as the Anchor of Jack Ford: Courtside on COURT TV, which he helped launch in 1991. He has also served as Chief Legal Correspondent on NBC News and as an Anchor/ Correspondent for ABC News. As a trial attorney, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial, one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases, and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s, and authored a number of articles for respected legal publications. He is the recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service work.  History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S. FRSEM-UA 437; class # 6790 Instructor: Jack Salzman  syllabus  Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory. JACK SALZMAN has been the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching award and two Fulbright Professorships. He formerly served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University, and for thirty years was the editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the five-volume Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.  Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature FRSEM-UA 440; class # 6791 Instructor: Saul Rosenberg  syllabus  Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Through the study of stories, novels, non-fiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later nineteenth century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the twentieth century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme. SAUL ROSENBERG, who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He has also been a consultant at McKinsey and Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he now manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal . Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present FRSEM-UA 442; class # 8752 Instructor: William Klein  syllabus  Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state and beyond? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as in the case of Galileo)? Are there types of truth that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, Negri and Zizek. WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of ideas in Liberal Studies, and has taught in the Freshman Honors Seminar program since 2003. He is currently writing a study of the history and theory of sedition and has also published works of fiction and art criticism. Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449; class # 8253 Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld  syllabus  Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War\u2013era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history. EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.

Spring 2014 Drama Criticism: In History and Practice FRSEM-UA 459, class # 7943 Instructor: Ethan Youngerman Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play\u2019s production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York\u2019s newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history. ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is a Senior Language Lecturer and Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College; he has won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the Expository Writing Program over a decade ago. He and his wife Rebecca were recently appointed Faculty Fellows in Residence. Ethan is also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including the Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play The Sublet Experiment ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from the New York Times , the Associated Press, New York magazine, and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461; class # 8167 Instructor: Jing Wang  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the eighteenth century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center, the novel intimately explores questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility and the excesses and decadence of the privileged, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original are advised to choose another Freshman Honors Seminar and take reading the Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. The readings and discussion for EAST-UA 228 are in Chinese, making this course more suitable for native speakers. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature . Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Oral History of Irish America FRSEM-UA 462; class # 8170 Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida  syllabus  Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Long before the technology of today's social media, cultures, families and individuals shared their personal and community stories in an oral tradition that preserved the past for future generations. We will examine the discipline and evolution of oral history using the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History of Irish America Collection to explore how aural memory contributes to the historical record and shapes the identity of individuals and communities. This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, as well as specific interviewing and research techniques. Students will gain access to our Archive of Irish America and have the opportunity to work with the interviews we have already deposited, including how the university\u2019s digital mapping technology can be applied in our analysis of the archive. Students will also have the chance to conduct an interview themselves..The course comprises classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises;. it offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers. LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Specializing in twentieth-century immigration, Professor Almeida has focused primarily on the \u201cNew Irish\u201d of the 1980s and 90s, publishing chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006). Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compared those who arrived in the 1950s with their counterparts thirty and forty years later. She has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives. Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d FRSEM-UA 463; class # 8365 Instructor: Shimon Dotan  syllabus  Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA). Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel FRSEM-UA 466; class # 8370 Instructor: Ilya Kliger  syllabus  Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. In this course we examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience, and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, are supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others. ILYA KLIGER is Assistant Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explored parallel developments in notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.  What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474; class # 8401 Instructor: Trace Jordan  syllabus   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It also prompts you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally\u2014 and most importantly\u2014how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment? TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Physics at Accelerators FRSEM-UA 477; class # 16309 Instructor: Henry Stroke  syllabus  Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radio frequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion is based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion requires an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, are introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection are discussed, as well as nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, are among the numerous detection techniques encountered. HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radio frequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \u201con-line\u201d mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible non-zero neutrino mass.  Gender, Sexuality and the Law FRSEM-UA 480; class # 8766 Instructor: Shelley Fischel  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What\u2019s the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments. SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her J.D. from Columbia University and her L.L.M. from NYU.            Spring 2014 Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice FRSEM-UA 484; class # 14990 Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? And how do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma , editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 , and editor and translator of The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke . He has published widely on photography and co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice, cross-listed in four NYU departments and two schools.  Spring 2014 American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820\u20132012 FRSEM-UA 485; class # 7948 Instructor: Beth Machlan  syllabus  Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to Buffy the Vampire Slayer , have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like Rosemary\u2019s Baby and Panic Room , and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11. BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories. Her academic work has appeared in Studies in the Novel , Representing Segregation , and the Los Angeles Review of Books , and her essays have been featured on The Awl, The Hairpin , and The Rumpus .  Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism FRSEM-UA 488; class # 8852 Instructor: William Ambler  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the seventeenth century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied seventeenth century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential. WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.  Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis FRSEM-UA 489; class # 8853 Instructor: Katherine Smith   syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.) This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses. KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, her dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Professor Smith spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity . An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. She is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled I n Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art , which opened in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.  Spring 2014 Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts FRSEM-UA 490; class # 7949 Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art. In fall 2013 the class blogged some of its creative writing exercises at http://nyusynesthesia.tumblr.com AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and has won awards from Yale University and Open City Magazine . She has worked as a teaching artist in New York City public schools, and last year co-designed and taught a course at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum titled \u201cResponding to Art Through Creative Writing.\u201d She is a past recipient of NYU\u2019s Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from NYU.  Spring 2014 Women in Social Movements in Latin America FRSEM-UA 493; class # 7951 Instructor: Pamela Calla  syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women\u2019s political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action, based on their own notion of what constitutes political and democratic gain, and the inclusion and attainment (or not), of economic, cultural, racial, and gender justice. PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU and director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia. Currently she also co-coordinates the \u201cNetwork of Observatories on Racism in the Americas,\u201d an initiative launched by the Universidad de la Cordillera and the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas. She is the author of works on race, racism, gender, sexism, ethnicity, interculturality and state formation in Bolivia and coeditor of Antropolog\u00eda del Estado: Dominaci\u00f3n y pr\u00e1cticas contestatarias en America Latina . She was an associate researcher for the United Nations-sponsored 2007 report \u201cThe State of the State in Bolivia,\u201d and co-editor of and contributor to Observando el racismo: Racismo y regionalismo en el proceso constituyente boliviano.  The Political Economy of Sports FRSEM-UA 494; class # 14769 Instructor: Neal Beck  syllabus  Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Political economy is a method that can be used to study many areas of human behavior (e.g. Becker on the family, Stigler on regulation, Fogel on history). Sports makes an excellent case study for many of the most important ideas and methods of political economy since it is more easily accessible and has better data than many other potential applications. Each topic is chosen to illustrate an important issue in political economy, and each class meeting features pointers to more traditional political economy applications. In order to cover a wide range of topics, we define political economy quite broadly. In light of NYU's global interests and presence, many applications are drawn from what is known as soccer in the United States. NATHANIEL BECK is Professor of Politics. He specializes in quantitative applications, both in public policy and political science, and issues of research design. He has been at NYU since 2003. At the undergraduate level, he teaches courses in quantitative approaches to public policy and the Senior Honors Seminar. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for Political Methodology, and the founding editor of Political Analysis. Barack Obama, the Man and the President: The Quest for Identity and Purpose FRSEM-UA 495; class # 14940 Instructor: Jeffrey Sammons  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course explores the life and career path of the nation\u2019s first \u201cblack\u201d president through a focus on his two autobiographies. The course also pays close attention to representations by others of Obama, including critics, supporters, and \u201cneutral\u201d commentators through a variety of media from books to film to television and radio to the blogosphere. As important as Obama is for his unprecedented political achievements, his multiracial, multicultural, multinational, and multi-religious background and experience make him an ideal subject for exploring personal and group identity in a time of apparently increasing concern with Otherness. Our goal is to reconcile vastly divergent representations of one person and not uncritically accept what we are led to believe by him or others. Through this process we not only learn about an extraordinary individual and the power he wields and path he shapes, but also about the writing and making of history and who we are\u2014as well as what we think, believe, and practice. JEFFREY T. SAMMONS is a Professor of History at New York University and specializes in African American, urban, military, sports, and film history. Sammons earned a Ph.D. in American History from the University of North Carolina in 1982. In 1983-84 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town. After his return from South Africa, Sammons became involved in the anti-apartheid movement and played an important role in the City of Houston\u2019s divestment campaign. Sammons is currently a National Senator of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Sammons is the author of Beyond the Ring: The Role of Boxing in American Society and has written widely on the subject of sport and race. In 2001 Sammons was awarded a fellowship by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and History and soon after received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for 2002-2003 in support of his soon to be published Never Retreat on the 15th NYNG/369th Regiment and the black soldier\u2019s quest for citizenship in the World War I era. The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496; class # 7284 Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has studied speech practices among Haitians (Queens, N.Y.), lawyers and litigants in lower Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, college students and their use of IM, and Bosavi people (Papua New Guinea).

How We See FRSEM-UA 497; class # 7289 Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chair of the Psychology Department. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D. in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. She has published many papers in the most prominent scientific journals in perception, in particular, and in science, in general. Her accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Finding New York City FRSEM-UA 498; class # 7291 Instructor: William Serrin  syllabus  Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. In this seminar, students explore, read, and write about\u2014and develop a deep understanding of\u2014New York City from diverse perspectives and by means of various media. We venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East rivers, restaurants, parks, and the like. We examine New York history and how the city has changed over the decades, writing several pieces on what we see and read and what people tell us. In the end, all should have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has changed over time, what remains from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the future might be. This is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New York City as its laboratory. The seminar turns to reading the splendid books or sections from the splendid books that deal with important aspects of the history and life of New York City, among them The Island at the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties; Forgotten Patriots; The Devil\u2019s Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America; Five Points; Positively 4th Street; and A Freewheelin\u2019 Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties . It also considers how the image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing in part on the book Celluloid Skyline . In addition, it uses parts of the Ken Burns PBS documentary series New York City . WILLIAM SERRIN is Collegiate Professor and Associate Professor of Journalism. Before joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for the New York Times. He has written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek, Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage , and the Nation , as well as the Columbia Journalism Review and the Village Voice . He is the author of Homestead: The Glory and Tragedy of an American Steel Town; The Company; and The Union: The \u201cCivilized Relationship\u201d of the General Motors Corporation and the United Automobile Workers . He is the editor of The Business of Journalism: 10 Leading Reporters and Editors on the Perils and Pitfalls of the Press and co-editor, with Judith Bruhn Serrin, of Muckraking: The Journalism That Changed America . He was a recipient of the Alicia Patterson Award, for study of American farm and food policies. He also won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award for outstanding labor coverage, and he was a member the Detroit Free Press team of reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 1967 Detroit riots. In addition, he was a recipient of the George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970. He is currently working on two new books: one a memoir of growing up in his hometown, an industrial town (Saginaw, Michigan), the other an examination of how, as industries emerge and grow in America, communities grow up and expand around them, then when the industries move or collapse, the communities that have served its citizens and country so well are often left to collapse and die.  Utopia and Apocalypse FRSEM-UA 499; class # 7294 Instructor: Eliot Borenstein  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) The utopian impulse is the drive to create the perfect world; the apocalypse is the global cataclysm that is often considered utopia\u2019s prerequisite. In this seminar, we examine the development of the utopian tradition, as both literary genre and philosophical thought experiment. Among the questions to be considered: What is the relationship between utopia and the novel? How do we get from \u201chere\u201d (the imperfect world) to \u201cthere\u201d (the perfect one), and how is this journey enacted in fiction? Why are the family, gender, and sexuality so central to the utopian tradition? What is the utopian conception of pleasure? Utopia is often seen as the?culmination of historical progress, the goal toward which humanity has been striving. Later utopian (and anti-utopian) fictions often place their \u201cperfect\u201d societies in a post-apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and temporal dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint of history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials consist of fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including the works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels, More, Moore and Gibbons, and Plato. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as Chair of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies and as Director of the Morse Academic Plan. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of Virginia. His first book, Men without Women: Masculinity and Revolution in Russian Fiction, 1917-1919 , won the AATSEEL award for best work in literary scholarship in 2000. In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture , which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in 2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500; class # 8327  syllabus  Instructor: Kathleen Gerson Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of caring for others. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New economic opportunities and pressures have sent women into the workplace. The rise of the \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family patterns. Taken together, these intertwined shifts represent a social transformation that is reshaping both the daily lives and life pathways of women and men. To explore the causes, consequences, and significance of these twin revolutions in work and care, the class addresses several questions. What does an overview of work, family, and gender changes tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these dilemmas? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? For the first half of the semester, students read, analyze, and discuss cutting-edge research; during the second half, students conduct their own research projects. KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in post-industrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany. In addition to serving as President of the Eastern Sociological Society and Chair of the Family Section of the American Sociological Association, she has contributed to many research and policy initiatives on work, family, and gender issues, including service as a founding board member of the Work-Family Researchers Network and as a board member of the Council on Contemporary Families. Her professional awards include the Jessie Bernard Award, given by the American Sociological Association in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society; the William Goode Distinguished Book Award, given by the Family Section of the ASA for The Unfinished Revolution; the Rosabeth Kanter Award for Excellence in Work-Family Research; the Distinguished Feminist Lectureship on Women and Social Change, awarded by Sociologists for Women in Society; the Kingsley Birge Endowed Lecture, at Colby College; and the Charles Phelps Taft Endowed Lecture, at the University of Cincinnati. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood.  Shamanism FRSEM-UA 501; class # 15017 Instructor: Bruce Grant  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. From New Age sweat lodges to Soviet Siberia, shamanic spirit mediums have been construed as everything from healers to magistrates to visionaries to political subversives. This course explores anthropological literature on shamanism in Asia and the Americas in order to ask how we constitute and appropriate the exotic in a variety of broadly construed religious settings. By focusing on the core figure of the shaman, we also attempt to track a twentieth-century history of anthropological reasoning. BRUCE GRANT is Professor of Anthropology and winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. A specialist on cultural politics in the formerly communist world, he is the author of two award-winning books, In the Soviet House of Culture: A Century of Perestroikas and The Captive and the Gift: Cultural Histories of Sovereignty in Russia and the Caucasus.  Frontiers of Biology FRSEM-UA 502; class # 15019 Instructor: Edo Kussell  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Prerequisites: Both AP Biology 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential) and at least one additional AP science (or mathematics) score of 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential). Biology has become an incredibly interdisciplinary science. Major breakthroughs often result from key collaborations between scientists inventing new technologies and biologists studying the fundamental questions of life. This seminar focuses on the latest discoveries in biology and the technological innovations that enable them. Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, the seminar leapfrogs classical textbook biology and mere memorization to present science at the forefront of biological research. Topics that may be covered (always in great depth and detail) include metagenomics, synthetic biology, quantitative immunology, microbial ecology, and biology at the single-molecule level. Emphasis is placed on understanding how the scientific research process works in today\u2019s world. This demanding course is geared towards highly motivated individuals, with a superlative high school background in science and a deep passion for scientific inquiry, but is open to students in all majors. Each student is required to lead at least one class session, to interview a scientist (no family members or scientists working at any NYU-affiliated school), and to produce a long research paper with accompanying formal oral presentation. EDO KUSSELL is an Associate Professor of Biology and Physics, and a faculty in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU. He is a recipient of both the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface and the McDonnell Foundation Research Award in Studying Complex Systems. Prof. Kussell's research is on evolutionary dynamics in general, with a focus on microorganisms. His lab studies bacterial adaptations to fluctuating environments, combining mathematical modeling, physics, and experimental biology. In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503; class # 7286 Instructor: Marcelle Clements Thursday, 2:15\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and deeply pleasurable reads. The richest of the themes it explores is desire\u2014its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of art. Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. Although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist (and the novelist\u2019s novelist), his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time \u2019s prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and of two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.  Spring 2014 American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan FRSEM-UA 504; class # 8309 Instructor: Marilyn B. Young  syllabus  Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The course will consider the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two wars of the 21st century. It will begin with the history, memory, and subsequent political uses of the Vietnam War. We will then move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by the way the administration of President George H.W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and goals, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We shall examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as well as the abundance of documentary and fiction film in which they have all been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B. YOUNG, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945\u20131990, The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895\u20131901, Transforming Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th Century , with William Rosenberg, and Human Rights and Revolutions , with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey Wasserstrom. She has also edited several collections of essays on the recent wars in Iraq and, most recently, Bombing Civilians: A 20th-Century History . She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of learned Societies Fellowship. Twice she has won the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, and she is currently co-director of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War. She is currently president-elect of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations.  Helen of Troy and Her Ghosts FRSEM-UA 505, class # 15880 Instructor: Liana Theodoratou  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon In Homer\u2019s Iliad , Helen, reflecting on her destiny, proclaims that her function is not primarily to be a woman, but to be first and foremost a story. \u201cOn us the gods have set an evil destiny,\u201d she explains, \u201cthat we should be a singer\u2019s theme / for generations to come\u201d (Il.6.357-58). Taking its point of departure from the Helen of ancient Greece\u2014the daughter of Zeus and Leda\u2014this course traces the various Helens whose stories have been told throughout the history of Western literature\u2014from the Helen of Homer to that of Sappho, Stesichorus, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides, Pierre Ronsard, Christopher Marlowe, Gerard de Nerval, Jean Giraudoux, W.B.Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Yannis Ritsos, and beyond. Within this literary trajectory, Helen becomes a means of tracing the story of literature itself. She is composed of all the ideas and desires that have been projected onto her body. In the wording of the modernist poet, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), \u201cHelen is the Greek drama.\u201d In each instance, Helen\u2019s identity is shattered across an entire history of representations of her relation to literature and poetry and, in the process, she even becomes another name for literature and poetry. Tracing this history permits us to think about the survival of the past in the present, about the role and place of representation in the establishment of identity in general, and about the way in which the present is haunted by the phantoms of the past. LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. She has written widely on ancient and modern Greek poetry and has translated several works by, among others, Foucault, Althusser, and Derrida into Modern Greek. She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece.  Game Theory and the Humanities FRSEM-UA 506; class # 15980 Instructor: Steven Brams  syllabus Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. Among the applications to be discussed are Abraham's decision to offer his son, Isaac, for sacrifice in the Bible; choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of Macbeth to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare's play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (the Civil War, the Great Depression, Watergate) and international crises (the Cuban missile crisis, the Iran hostage crisis); and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22) . STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature. He holds two patents for fair-division algorithms and is chairman of the advisory board of Fair Outcomes, Inc. He is a former president of the Peace Science Society and of the Public Choice Society. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Guggenheim Fellow, and was a Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.   Spring 2014 What is Memory FRSEM-UA 507; class # 14597 Instructor: Suzanne England  syllabus  Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as How is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. SUZANNE ENGLAND is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. What is Memory FRSEM-UA 507; class # 16468 Instructor: Martha Rust  syllabus  Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia.

Spring 2014 Great Inventions in World History: Breakthrough Technologies that Changed the Course of Civilizations FRSEM-UA 508; class # 14598 Instructor: Richard W. Hull  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) This seminar is an exploration in human ingenuity, from antiquity to the twentieth century. It focuses on eighteen key inventions that profoundly affected the course of civilizations and that changed the way people lived and thought about themselves and the world around them. It examines the origins of the inventions, the individuals or groups that developed or conceived them, their initial impact on the societies of their inventors, their diffusion to other cultures and ultimately their impact on a global scale. It considers the transfer of technical knowledge from one country or culture to another and how it is modified and adapted by the recipients and may trigger a different but improved or related invention. In the process, we examine the interaction of technologies and society. Some inventions constitute \u201cbricolage,\u201d taking available resources and cobbling them together to create entirely new uses. Each invention we study generated a veritable revolution in the way humans interacted with each other, organized their lives, and mobilized their human and natural resources. In some cases we consider how specific inventions improved the human condition and/or degraded it. We explore the very idea of \u201cinvention\u201dand weigh situations or intellectual challenges that gave rise to inventive impulses. We pose numerous questions: Why do some societies enthusiastically embrace a given invention or innovation while others reject it as see it as a threat? How do some groups attempt to monopolize an invention and endeavor to prevent its spread to other governments or cultures? The scope of the course is expansive, running from such geniuses as al-Khwarizmi and his algorithms in the ninth century C.E. to Steve Jobs and the computer in the twentieth. RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns, Modern Africa , and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations .

Spring 2014 Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace FRSEM-UA 509; class # 14599 Instructor: Anne Lounsbery  syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Our first priority is a careful reading of Tolstoy\u2019s massive novel (if it is in fact a \u201cnovel\u201d: this is one of the questions we address), with the goal of understanding how the text works. We also consider the book\u2019s historical context, the sources that Tolstoy drew on, its place in his oeuvre and thought, its place in the Russian tradition and in \u201cworld\u201d literature, and the various uses that have been made of it since its initial publication.

Philosophizing with Shakespeare FRSEM-UA 510; class # 16302 Instructor: Tom Gerety  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. One of the fascinating things about William Shakespeare is that we can never be sure if the exchanges and speeches he gives to his characters show his own convictions or, more likely, his conception of how kings and queens and lovers would think and feel. This seminar examines several of his greatest plays, including King Lear, Hamlet, The Tempest , and The Merchant of Venice . We study these and a few other plays in depth and with special attention to the ideas and arguments in them about life and death, the relations between the sexes, and between the classes. We consider the views his characters articulate about love and hatred, God and morality, virtue and vice. We try to understand what he thought about government and coercion, and about the limits of freedom and the inevitability of oppression and tragedy. We read (and see, on stage and on film) his plays and look to his great sources such as the King James Bible and the Essays of Michel de Montaigne. We learn all that we can about his life in Stratford and London, the world of the stage and court, and the great political and religious controversies of his time in England and Europe. We find that Shakespeare was in many ways not just an artist but a philosopher. His gift for summarizing and personifying ideas make him an elusive but important figure in the history of ideas. He stands on the bridge, as it were, between the Renaissance and the modern world. His ideas\u2013or those to which he gave such powerful voice\u2013propelled England and Europe towards the modern world of science, skepticism and materialism that we now inhabit. TOM GERETY, Collegiate Professor, joined the NYU faculty in 2005, having first come to NYU two years earlier to head the Brennan Center for Justice at the Law School. Before then he served as President of Amherst College from 1994 to 2003 and of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1994. From 1986 to 1989 he was the Dean and Nippert Professor at the College of Law of the University of Cincinnati. As a law professor he taught and wrote on constitutional law and political philosophy, with a special emphasis on First Amendment freedoms, including speech, privacy, and religious freedom. With Judy Woodruff, he wrote and narrated a PBS series, Visions of the Constitution , funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is the author, most recently, of The Freshman Who Hated Socrates . The Remarkable Normans: Europe from 911 to 1204 FRSEM-UA 511; class # 16303 Instructor: Jill N. Claster  syllabus  Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Few people in all of European history can boast a history of achievements comparable to that of the Normans in the nearly three hundred years following the founding of the duchy of Normandy in 911. From the tenth century until 1204, there was not a single important event in which the Normans were not involved or did not play a pivotal role. This course follows the Norman expansion: the conquest of England, of Sicily and southern Italy, of large parts of France, and cities in the eastern Mediterranean. The Normans were initiators and leaders of the crusades to the Holy Land and they fought as well in Spain against the Muslims. Although these descendants of Viking invaders never lost their taste for adventure and their warlike spirit, the Normans were also great organizers and the government in Normandy, as well as in the places they conquered, were the most advanced and efficient in all of Europe. They left a rich legacy in every field imaginable: art and architecture, religious institutions, political organization, and educational institutions. The Normans stood at the forefront of a long period of material, cultural and spiritual progress in Europe, and this seminar studies the many gifts the Normans gave to European civilization. JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 . She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.  Spring 2014 Nuclear Energy FRSEM-UA 512; class # 14600 Instructor: Antoine Cerfon  syllabus  Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Nuclear power currently provides 13% of the world's electricity and is expected to play an important role in the diversified energy mix that countries are developing to meet the world's growing energy needs. As a carbon-free, continuous energy source, it is an attractive solution for base-load electricity production, and a desirable complement to intermittent sources such as solar and wind. However, it also faces serious technological, economical and societal challenges that question its development. In this seminar, we follow a multidisciplinary approach to explore the different dimensions of the debate about nuclear power. We look at the basic nuclear physics in the core of power plants, the different power plant concepts and their engineering solutions, the nuclear fuel cycle, the issues of waste, safety and proliferation, nuclear power economics, and the place of nuclear energy in the global energy landscape. ANTOINE CERFON is Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He obtained his Ph.D. in the Nuclear Science and Engineering department at MIT, and stayed there for two more years as a post-doctoral researcher before joining NYU in 2012. His main area of study is in plasma physics for particle accelerators and nuclear fusion applications. Introduction to Aesthetics FRSEM-UA 513; class # 16306 Instructor: Eduardo Subirats  syllabus  Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar focuses on four major Western theorists of aesthetics: Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. It will reconstruct central categories such as form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will analyze four programmatic works of art: modern \u201ccubism\u201d (Picasso), a Greek tragedy (Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound ), a German trickster ( Till Eugenspiegel ), and a French revolutionary painter (Courbet\u2019s Atelier ). Its ultimate goal is a critique of contemporary artistic decadence and anti-aesthetics. EUDARDO SUBIRATS is Professor of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include Spanish intellectual history; the Counter-Reformation and the colonization of Spanish America; the Enlightenment; avant-garde theory, artistic movements in Spain and Latin America; and the modern Latin American and Spanish essay. Among his many publications are Linterna M\u00e1gica; El continente vac\u00edo; Da vanguarda ao p\u00f3s-moderno; Memoria y exilio; Viaje al fin del Para\u00edso. Un ensayo sobre Am\u00e9rica latina; and Filosof\u00eda y tiempo final.  Spring 2014 Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher FRSEM-UA 514; class # 14601 Instructor: Vincent Renzi  syllabus  Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m. Required Cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Oeconomicus, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Associate Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics. He serves as a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Perception of Art FRSEM-UA 515; class # 16494 Instructor: Denis Pelli  syllabus  Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. We apply the scientific methods of perception research, psychophysics, to explore and understand how people experience art. A few artists (e.g. a painter and a photographer) visit class or invite us to their studios to talk about the creative process and answer questions. We visit current shows in museums and galleries that address questions that arise in class--for example, do artists distinguish painting for themselves from painting for the public? Why is a figure like Philip Guston so popular among fellow painters, but unpopular with the public and critics? Pairs of students collaborate on an experiment answering some question or topic bearing on the perception of art, which is written up as a term project. DENIS PELLI, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU, has contributed new measurement techniques, major empirical findings, and useful theoretical accounts of object recognition. As a psychophysicist, he invented many widely used and highly cited methods for testing how vision works. His 150 papers on object recognition have been cited nearly 10,000 times. His scientific expertise is complemented by an informal knowledge of art. He grew up in a family of architects and a landscape designer (Pelli and Balmori) that spends most of its time together talking about how things look and why. He enjoys sketching and also helped a choreographer produce a ballet designed to be seen in peripheral vision. For more on his work, visit http://denispelli.com.  Spring 2014 Architecture in the City FRSEM-UA 516; class # 14602 Instructor: Marvin Trachtenberg  syllabus  Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) This seminar introduces students to key themes in western architecture from prehistory to postmodernity. It bridges immediacy and history using the buildings and spaces of our city as a primary object of study. Key texts are discussed, but emphasis is placed on the experience and understanding of buildings and their sites through media (photography and film) and direct encounters with the built environment of New York City. Themes such as the ecological basis of architecture, the question of nature, culture, and landscape, and architecture as idea, process, artifact and space are explored along with other topics relevant to the understanding of architecture. As an undergraduate, MARVIN TRACHTENBERG studied English literature at Yale with Harold Bloom. At the the Institute of Fine Arts, he turned to premodern architecture under Wolfgang Lotz, Richard Pommer, and especially Richard Krautheimer, who supervised his monograph on the Florentine Campanile (awarded the Society of Architectural Historians\u2019 Hitchcock Prize). After a return to modernity with his Statue of Liberty and a decade producing a survey of architectural history ( Architecture from Prehistory to Postmodernity ), Trachtenberg again focused on pre-modern Italy with his radically revisionist (and award-winning) study of trecento urbanism, Dominion of the Eye . Issues raised by structures with long building histories and multiple architects led him to formulate the ideas discussed in Building-in-Time from Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (George Sarton Prize in History of Science, Ghent University). He is currently completing a book, on new discursive terms, for Yale University Press on Brunelleschi and the Pazzi Chapel. Since 1967 he has taught at the Institute of Fine Arts, where he is Edith Kitzmiller Professor of Art History. Spain in 1492: From the 'Moor's Last Sigh' to the Conquest of the New World FRSEM-UA 517; class # 16558 Instructor: Sarah Pearce  syllabus  Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The year 1492 in Spain is the very definition of a watershed. Four major, related events took place that completely altered the social, political, religious, intellectual, literary and linguistic landscape: the city of Granada, the last Muslim principality in Spain, fell to the Catholic crown of Castile and Leon; the order was signed and carried out expelling or forcing the conversion of Spain\u2019s Jews; with Spanish backing, Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the New World; and the first grammar of a vernacular Romance language, Castilian, appeared in print and was dedicated to the queen in honor of her imperial ambitions. This course examines literary and historical writing about these events. Through careful reading of primary sources and attention to modern historians\u2019 rhetoric in writing about 1492, students explore how these events were implicated in the formation of national and religious identities in late medieval and early modern Spain. Reading in a wide variety of genres leads to diverse writing assignments in a variety of genres to help prepare students for further coursework in the liberal arts. S.J. PEARCE is an assistant professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. She returns to NYU after having held the Apfelbaum Fellowship in Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania during 2012-13, where she completed a book-length manuscript entitled \"No Achievement But Through Arabic\" in which she explores the attitudes of medieval Spanish Jews towards reading and writing in the Arabic language. She tweets about the Middle Ages @homophonous. Urban Objects: How Things in the City Make Life Possible or (Almost) Impossible FRSEM-UA 518; class # 16559 Instructor: Harvey Molotch  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon We concentrate on very ordinary things: trash bins, stop signs, lamp posts, turnstiles, fences, and whatever else we encounter in the course of public city life. We trace out where these things come from, what caused them to take their specific forms and the way they cost or benefit social groups in particular ways (e.g. women versus men, kids versus adults, rich versus poor). Our interest is in public space, public life, and private benefits as revealed by the things we see, touch, jump over, ignore, vandalize and use. All along, we read about urban space, the use and abuse of the city, and the role of physical objects in our lives. We do first-hand studies of people\u2019s encounters with these artifacts in real time. Each student chooses one or more objects for preliminary write-up(s) and then hones in on one for a final term paper. HARVEY MOLOTCH, Professor of Sociology and Metropolitan Studies, has authored many articles and books, the most recent being Against Security: How We Go Wrong at Airports, Subways, and Other Sites of Ambiguous Danger . A prior book, Where Stuff Comes From, analyzes the world of product development and design. His awards include: Distinguished Contribution to the Discipline of Sociology, Award for Lifetime Achievement in Urban and Community Studies, and Lifetime Achievement in Sociology of the Environment and Technology.  Encountering Martin Luther King, Jr. FRSEM-UA 519; class # 16575 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus  Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.)  Few historical figures are more revered or transcendent than Martin Luther King Jr. But as David Levering Lewis wrote thirty-five years ago, America\u2019s canonization of him has draped him in such a cloak of mythology that \u201cin a sense we have sought to remember him by forgetting him.\u201d This course seeks to vividly remember the human being at the center of the most significant popular movement in U.S. history, one that took up the unfinished legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction eighty years after the nation turned its back on social and racial justice. Students explore King\u2019s thought, oratory, character, and public actions in a way that will make him unforgettable to them. We consider his tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth from a southern Baptist minister to a leading civil rights activist to a visionary leader of global human rights and peace. We ask if he was a radical or a moderate and why he felt history had \u201chunted him down,\u201d as he once claimed to fellow activist Rosa Parks. In what ways can new information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing periods of American history? Using film and little-known radio interviews as part of the class research, as well a challenging immersion in some of the most significant King literature, the course, coming in the fiftieth anniversary year of the March on Washington, makes King and his times newly relevant to our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and violence-haunted world. PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities, and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five books, including Looking for Lincoln, The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America\u2019s Greatest Showman . He was also writer and co-producer of more than a dozen documentary films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and others, including the ten-part PBS series The American President , and the sixteen part Freedom: A History of US. Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in Annandale, New York. Writing the Self and New York FRSEM-UA 520; class # 18468 Instructor: David J. Dent Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. In this course students begin the semester by dusting off their college admissions essays. The first assignment requires students to explore the ideas of the personal essay beyond the individual and develop the essay into a piece of narrative nonfiction. Beyond that first assignment, students spend the semester exploring the city of New York through a series of writing assignments on urban life. Students also read several classic pieces of literary journalism, personal essays and fiction about life in New York City. DAVID J. DENT is Associate Professor at New York University where he holds a joint appointment at the Arthur Carter Journalism Institute and in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. He created the course \u201cDeconstructing Obama\u201d and teaches courses in journalism and non-fiction writing.

The organization uses the tools of journalism to help middle and high school students become better writers, a method detailed in The Best Essay of Your Life.   Spring 2014 Visuality and Literature FRSEM-UA 521; class # 14603 Instructor: Jennifer Cayer  syllabus  Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) In this course we examine twentieth-century and contemporary essays, novels, short stories and plays that are preoccupied with the visual, perform visually, or integrate images within narrative. Some of these works respond directly to pieces of visual art or analyze forms of seeing; others include images such as photographs or drawings. This is a writing-intensive course. While actively discussing the course materials, students consistently and frequently engage them through critical and creative, formal and informal writing. One of our goals is to deepen our own practices of seeing and using visual evidence as a method toward writing personal, exploratory, and persuasive essays. Topics may include: memoir, documentary works, photography, film adaptations, comics, graphic novels, artists books and surrealism.

Spring 2014 Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522; class # 14604 Instructor: Tara K. Parmiter Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Essayist Loren Eiseley asserts that \u201ceven in New York City there are patches of wilderness,\u201d encouraging his readers to rethink the way they define and limit their use of this loaded word. In this course we examine both the idea and the manifestation of these wildernesses, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Readings include selections by Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, Terry Tempest Williams, bell hooks, Wendell Berry, and William Cronon, among others. Students compose both critical analyses of the texts and their own nature writing based on their exploration of and research into their own \u201cpatch\u201d of New York wilderness. TARA K. PARMITER is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program and a Mentor in the Undergraduate Writing Tutors Program. Her research interests include literature and the environment, turn-of-the-twentieth century women\u2019s literature, children\u2019s literature, travel narratives, and popular culture.

Spring 2014 Reading Toni Morrison FRSEM-UA 523; class # 14612 Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature, Toni Morrison was the eighth woman and first African American ever to receive that award. In its citation, the Swedish Academy praised her as someone \u201cwho, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality.\u201d This course seeks to identify and to examine that \u201cessential aspect of American reality.\u201d We read the writings of Morrison, exploring the ways in which she represents history, identity, nation, race, gender, sexuality, and community in novels and essays that both challenge and complicate our understanding of these themes. Our aim is to understand the formal aspects of her writing\u2014how her novels \u201cwork\u201d as literature\u2014as well as the cultural and historical interventions it makes. We also take up questions about Morrison\u2019s reputation among contemporary readers of her fiction, and the various outlets, including Oprah\u2019s Book Club, where it has been championed. Students taking this class should expect to read great books that inspire hard conversations about race, gender, sexuality, and American social and cultural history; through our reading, several short papers, and a research project of their own design students hone their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers. ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction.

Spring 2014 Atlantic Migrations since 1600 FRSEM-UA 524; class # 14629 Instructor: Joe Lee  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The movement of people, voluntarily and involuntarily, from Europe and Africa across the Atlantic to North and South America since about 1600 is one of the epochal events in world history. It has had a major impact\u2014and in many cases has left an indelible mark\u2014on the histories of both the sending and receiving of societies and cultures, whether the multitudes involved moved as free men and women, as indentured servants, or as slaves. This course seeks to understand the causes and consequences, economic, social, political and cultural, of these massive movements of human beings. JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU.

Fern\u00e1ndez Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Prerequisite: reading knowledge of Spanish and/or a score of 4 or 5 on any AP Spanish exam (or international equivalent). According to demographers, in the near future one out of every three New Yorkers will be of Hispanic origin. Far from being a recent phenomenon, the presence of Spanish-speaking people in the city can be traced back almost to the origins of the city in the seventeenth century. In the first part of this course we study the history of links between New York City and the Spanish-speaking world, from the arrival of 23 Sephardic Jews to the town of New Amsterdam in 1654, to the arrival of Spanish refugees fleeing from Fascism in the early 1940s. During the second part of the course, participants contribute to the creation of a website that will map and document traces of Spain and Spanish-speakers in the city of New York. We make a number of field trips during the semester, and one of the assignments is to design and script a walking tour. Readings include texts by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (Cuba), Bernardo Vega (Puerto Rico) and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (Spain). JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.

Spring 2014 Biography's Many Lives FRSEM-UA 526; class # 14605 Instructor: Victoria Olsen  syllabus  Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The genre of biography has traced lives of \"famous men\" since Plutarch and Boswell's Johnson, but its conventional forms and techniques have come into question over the last century. This course examines how biography provides a window into different periods, cultures, and disciplines and how it has had to stretch to incorporate new voices, methodologies, and techniques. From Virginia Woolf's Orlando to Rebecca Skloot's Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, biography has pushed the boundaries of literary form and scientific knowledge. We read a broad range of subjects and styles\u2014exploring issues of research, writing, and reading\u2014to become biographers of the genre itself. VICTORIA OLSEN, Ph.D. is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where she teaches Writing the Essay to freshmen at Tisch and Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines to undergraduates in CAS. She has been a writing consultant and mentor to writing tutors in psychology, biology, philosophy, and history courses.

Mol\u00e9  syllabus   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon We regularly take for granted that scientific knowledge is objective, a universal truth unchanged by history and culture. The laws of physics are just as true in Indonesia as they are in Mexico or the United States. Yet we also know that scientific knowledge is constantly in flux. What we \u201cknew\u201d to be true yesterday (e.g., the world is flat) is not true today, and new discoveries revolutionize what we knew (e.g., germ theory, epigenetics). This seminar positions science along a spectrum of worldviews\u2014explanatory models that provide causal reasons and underlying logics for events and actions\u2014a spectrum that includes magic, occultism, witchcraft, science, spirituality, and religion. A single hurricane might be explained, within particular historical and cultural contexts, as being sent by a witch\u2019s curse, a moving cold front, or an angry god. How we position ourselves between these ways of knowing is not, of course, mutually exclusive and the threshold between the categories is actually more blurred than we might initially expect. Interrogating the similarities and differences between \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cbelief,\u201d this course questions our deeply held assumptions regarding the neutrality of science and the so-called backwardness of folk belief. How do socio-cultural contexts and economic systems shape the production of scientific knowledge? Why do certain theories achieve recognition as rational and correct? We explore the social, economic, and political implications of these hierarchies of knowledge, and examine how they shape how we experience our own bodies, our own feelings, and even our own minds. NOELLE J. MOL\u00c9 is a cultural anthropologist and author of Labor Disorders in Neoliberal Italy: Mobbing, Well-being and the Workplace . She is currently investigating the rise of scientific skepticism and supernatural beliefs in Italy as twin responses to a millennial crisis in knowledge production. She is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program.  Spring 2014 The Art of Note Taking FRSEM-UA 528; class # 14606 Instructor: Louis Bury Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Taking notes is first and foremost a utilitarian act, a way of recording information for the purposes of future use and improved retention. But notes also possess, importantly, an aesthetic dimension: splayed across the page in poetic fragments, they present a veritable graph of a mind in motion. In this course we consider note taking as both an aesthetic and utilitarian act. Our course readings focus on exemplary notes, diaries, and journals by prominent 20th century writers and artists, as well as older species of textual response such as Talmudic commentary and marginalia on Medieval manuscripts. We may also consider contemporary forms of digital writing that verge on note taking, such as blog posts, tweets, and Internet commentary. We use these texts as both source material and inspiration for our own extensive note taking. The goal is not simply to help you to become a better note taker but to help you understand how note taking is itself a form of writing and of thinking and not merely preparation for the \"real\" writing that you submit to your professors. Course requirements include: weekly reading and note taking; a midterm presentation; one short essay; and a final research project, developed out of your weekly notes. LOUIS BURY is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. His first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (Dalkey Archive Press, forthcoming) applies rules and restrictions in order to write poetic, autobiographical literary criticism. He is currently taking notes for a book on literary note taking.  Spring 2014 Sensual Shifts: From Looking to Listening in Modernist Literature FRSEM-UA 529; class # 14607 Instructor: Angela Frattarola  syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). From Greek philosophy to the Enlightenment, vision was the privileged sense. Traditionally associated with knowledge and rationality, vision encourages a subject to keep a distanced, analytical perspective of an object. But does this always have to be the case? Can the other senses allow new ways of conceiving of and experiencing the relationship between the self and the world? This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world. We accomplish this by closely reading modernist novels that suggest a growing skepticism toward vision and heightened attention to sound and listening. In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time. Readings for the course consist of essays from sound studies as well as novels by Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Jean Rhys, and James Joyce. ANGELA FRATTAROLA is a Senior Lecturer and Writing Tutor Mentor in NYU's Expository Writing Program. Her essays on modernist literature have appeared in such journals as Modern Drama, Genre, Mosaic, Studies in the Novel, Journal of Modern Literature, and Woolf Studies Annual . She has nearly completed a manuscript entitled Auditory Narrative in the Modernist Novel: Early Twentieth-Century Soundscapes and Audio-Technologies , a study that examines how modernist literature was shaped by developing auditory technologies and changes in auditory perception at the turn of the century.  Spring 2014 Rediscovering Bacchic Revelry FRSEM-UA 530; class # 15031 Instructor: Megan Shea  syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). When we think about the staging of ancient Greek theater, we often envision a static stage where a masked man recites a lengthy monologue in an outdoor theater. But such a vision hardly describes the dynamic celebration of music, sexuality, and poetry that infused the City Dionysia and the Lenaia\u2014the Athenian festivals centered on tragedy and comedy in the sixth through the fourth Centuries B.C.E. In this seminar, we reimagine the performance of Greek theater by witnessing current productions of Greek plays, engaging with New York City\u2019s various collections of Greek art objects, studying contemporary festivals and celebrations, poring through critical interpretations of Greek history, and returning to textual evidence (the plays!). Beyond reconstructing our own understandings of ancient performance, we use the discord between our original scenarios of Greek performance and our revisions to evaluate how we conceive of Western civilization\u2019s past. Weekly response papers, a performance/design project, and a final research paper help awaken our sense of ancient performative acts. MEGAN SHEA is a language lecturer in NYU\u2019s Expository Writing Program. She received her Ph.D. in Theater Arts from Cornell University, where she studied women\u2019s performance in ancient Greece and the contemporary West. While teaching at Cornell, she received the Gertrude Spencer Student Portfolio Award, and she has received several Excellence in Teaching awards while at NYU. Dr. Shea has published articles in The Journal for Dramatic Theory and Criticism and TheatreForum . She recently premiered her translation of Euripides\u2019 Cyclops at Dixon Place.  Spring 2014 Left Brain, Right Brain, Whole Brain: Acts of Knowledge, Discovery, and Creation FRSEM-UA 531; class # 14608 Instructor: David Ellis  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Artists and scientists are often split into separate camps in the university and in our collective imagination; this split can even divide our individual minds. \u201cLeft brains\u201d\u2014the analytical, logical, objective among us\u2014become engineers, biologists, and bankers while \u201cright brains\u201d\u2014intuitive, thoughtful, subjective\u2014are the painters, philosophers, and social workers of the world. In practice, in the science lab or in the artist\u2019s studio, these distinctions may be more porous than we popularly believe. This seminar explores the interplay between reasoning, knowledge, belief, discovery, and creativity\u2014acts of mind common to all fields in the academy. Whether presented to us in the \u201creal world,\u201d the arts, or philosophy, we will wrestle with conundrums which resist easy solution. We explore many branches\u2014logic, physics, neurology, psychology, literature, film, visual and performance art\u2014hunting for approaches to understanding which we then put into practice. We work towards the goal of \u201cunderstanding our understanding,\u201d as the artist Matthew Goulish phrases it, in order to exploit the twinned powers of rationality and creativity. Trips to MoMath (Museum of Mathematics), MoMA, and other outings are planned. In his \u201cright-brained\u201d work as a poet, fiction writer, and visual artist, DAVID ELLIS explores science topics with a humanities approach, such as the nature of time, memory, sensory perception, social dynamics, and spatial relationships. His work in NYU\u2019s Writing in the Disciplines program has taken him into a range of \u201cleft-brained\u201d classrooms, from astrophysics to psychology, and at the City University of New York he teamed up with a geologist and a classicist who specializes in Roman artifacts to teach a series a classes with shared research and creative practices, which was the basis of their work \u201cVolcanoes, Vases, and Creation Stories.\u201d He teaches in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. Natural and Artificial Intelligence FRSEM-UA 532; class # 18663 Instructor: Gary Marcus  syllabus Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Prerequisite: Programming experience recommended. Who's smarter\u2014Siri or Einstein? Is a \"singularity\" imminent? Through readings in psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science, we compare brains and computers, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and the prospects for human-level artificial intelligence. Topics include language, vision, game-playing, robotics, common-sense reasoning, and computational creativity. GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .  New Worlds, Old Worlds: Travelers and Pilgrims in Renaissance Europe and the Americas FRSEM-UA 533; class # 19001 Instructor: Jane Tylus Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Renaissance men\u2014and women\u2014found themselves at the intersection of colliding ideas about the worlds they lived in. They both looked back to antiquity and the Bible, and ahead to new and unpredictable changes regarding religion, geography, and science. The literature of travel in the period bears witness to the instability and excitement of the centuries that bear the hallmarks of the \u201cearly modern.\u201d Travelers included pilgrims and knights going off on crusade and missionaries going off to convert, as well as explorers, merchants, and inevitably, exiles. If pilgrimage was about the return to a \u201ccenter\u201d\u2014Jerusalem most prominently, but also Rome\u2014 exploration meant voyaging to an unknown periphery, and exilic wandering meant heading toward a new and uncertain home. We explore the period from roughly 1300 to 1700 through travel literature ranging from pilgrimage accounts to Columbus\u2019s letters to an epic about the first Crusade. We also look at such alternate accounts as the Aztec version of the conquista and Arabic responses to the Crusades. The course includes visiting at least one museum in New York and studying cartographic images at the New York Public Library. Students produce collaborative in-class presentations as well as a final paper exploring their own personal journey through the new and old worlds they encountered during their first semester of college. JANE TYLUS is Professor of Italian Studies and Comparative Literature at NYU, as well as faculty director of the Humanities Initiative. Prior to coming to NYU in 2003 she taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While her research focus of late has been on Italian women writers\u2014she is the award-winning author of Reclaiming Catherine of Siena: Literature, Literacy, and the Signs of Others and translator of the poetry of Gaspara Stampa and Lucrezia Tornabuoni\u2014she is really a comparatist at heart, and her favorite courses are on the \"great books\" of world literature. Her current projects are books on the beautiful Tuscan hill-town of Siena and on medieval and early modern pilgrimage. On Being Human FRSEM-UA 534; class # 19002 Instructors: G. Gabrielle Starr &amp; Jane Tylus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The sciences are united by their method of inquiry into the natural world and the social sciences in their study of human behavior, but the humanities seem different \u2014rich, heterogeneous, or perhaps even fragmented. Different or not, the humanities offer unique and powerful models that help us think about and understand the world we inhabit. We study ideas that have been foci of humanist inquiry from the ancient world to the present, and engage these ideas to show what humanist thought has to contribute to some big questions about human life. These ideas include simile (with a focus on pain, trauma, and the medical humanities), evidence (digital humanities, archives, and jurisprudence), dialogue (music, drama), empathy (history and philosophy), and ekphrasis (art history and literature). The course features site visits to the places where humanist engagement matters (hospitals, archives, museums, and even law courts) and encourages students to reflect upon their possible career paths as well as the connections among different disciplines, eras, and methodologies. Finally, the course considers why New York City and NYU are crucial for the humanities in the twenty-first century, in light of the City\u2019s diverse nature and NYU\u2019s identity as a global university. G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts. JANE TYLUS is Professor of Italian Studies and Comparative Literature at NYU, as well as faculty director of the Humanities Initiative. Prior to coming to NYU in 2003 she taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Her current projects are books on the beautiful Tuscan hill-town of Siena and on medieval and early modern pilgrimage.  Spring 2014 Cataclysm and Voice in the Twentieth-Century Novel FRSEM-UA 535; class # 15225 Instructor: Leeore Schnairsohn Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). The course examines how novelists of the twentieth century responded to the cataclysms, both conceptual and historical, of that slippery and multifarious period of time. At the century's opening, people were trying to get a grip on things like airplanes and telephones and relativity theory and the Russian Revolution. Concurrently, artists were changing the way they made art, and kept changing it as the century continued to provoke them. We read some astounding novelists and consider their voices in conversation with the cataclysms of their times. We also write in response to the ways our world is changing at the turn of this new century, and attempt experiments with fiction and essay to construct true slivers of experience that speak from our own historical position. The class period is divided between discussion of the week's reading and a creative writing workshop. In addition to a final critical essay, students are expected to contribute one piece of creative prose (likely some form of fiction) to the workshop, and complete weekly writing assignments (some creative, some in response to the reading, some both). LEEORE SCHNAIRSOHN holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Princeton and is currently a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. His translations of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam have appeared in Portals and Inventory ; he has also published review articles in the Slavic and East European Journal and Canadian-American Slavic Studies . He is at work on a vampire novel and a non-vampire novel.  Spring 2014 Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536; class # 15924 Instructor: Dylon Robbins Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Brazil is often invoked in conversations about race and culture. Whether as an example of presumably more egalitarian race relations, or as a regional culture embodying an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements, Brazil is a model for understanding heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. We explore some of the unique contradictions shaping Brazilian reality as related to notions of race and culture by tracing the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, examining such key examples and events as slavery and the plantation economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. How do race and culture coincide and diverge in Brazil? And what may we gather about these convergences and divergences from textual, musical, and cinematic examples? DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular interest in the cultural and theoretical production of these regions, in addition to that of the African Diasporas in general, with particular concern for intellectual and cultural histories, media, cinema, and popular music. His work is supported by archival research in Brazil as a Fulbright-Hays fellow at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros, and in Cuba at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. He is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.  Spring 2014 Lincoln in Time: Private and Public Transformations   FRSEM-UA 537; class # 16575 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt    syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00-3:00 p.m.   This seminar engages students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln's  transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American  presidencies. We closely explore the personal Lincoln, always in the  context of his times and their challenges, and see how a series of  wrenching personal crises sorely tested but also helped forge Lincoln's  character. Through the study of key texts, through intensive group  discussion, and through written and spoken communication, the seminar  presents students with a series of questions: Is there a moral realm with  which human actors engage for good or ill? How do private decisions and  inner resolves impact unfolding events? And how do figures like Lincoln  manage to grow past limitations of viewpoint and errors of judgment to  embrace universal human values and commitments?  We examine Lincoln's role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric,  and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of  slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How  was he influenced by other figures around him-southerners, abolitionists,  former slaves, politicians? And how did he learn to use words so  effectively to help produce social transformation? Concurrent with a close  study of Lincoln's written and spoken words, and of the political, social,  and interpersonal context of his times, students also wrestle with the  vital question of how they can construct their own lives.     PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities,  and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He  focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five  books, including Looking for Lincoln, The American President, and P.T.  Barnum: America's Greatest Showman. He was also writer and co-producer of  more than a dozen documentary films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and  others, including the ten-part PBS series The American President, and the  sixteen part Freedom: A History of US.  Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in  Annandale, New York.  Spring 2014 Pirates, Privateers and Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean FRSEM-UA 538; class # 16278 Instructor: Edgardo Morales  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Pirates, privateers and runaways of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century Caribbean fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. Today, the Jolly Roger --the pirate flag-- is clearly displayed in toys and makes for compelling cinematic moments. In real life, however, flying that flag was a criminal act punishable with the death penalty. How must we think of Francis Drake, the most feared privateer of the 1500s, in the age of Jack Sparrow, the most renown of the fantasy pirates of our days? This class will approach the history of maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might otherwise escape scholarly inquiry. While outsiders often described pirates and privateers as renegades, godless,   murderers and villains, privateer men like Francis Drake,   pirate women like Anne Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at   the very center of important political questions of their age. Students will read academic books such as Villains of All Nations , by the historian Marcus Rediker, as well as original documents dating back to the age of piracy. Prof. EDGARDO PEREZ MORALES graduated with a Ph.D in history from the University of Michigan. He has conducted research on privateers during the Age of Revolutions in archives and libraries in Colombia, Cuba, France, Jamaica, Spain and the United States. He teaches at NYU\u2019s Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.                        Welcome!
