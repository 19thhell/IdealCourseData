Marta has been singing in various Prague choirs since she was a young child, and when Steinhardt College at NYU decided to set up a music program in Prague, she was the obvious choice for program coordinator. Marta works with each music student individually, finding them the most suitable internships, helping them set up ensembles, scouring the city for the perfect venue, chasing down instruments, and much more.     Marta studied Japanese at Charles University and loves the culture, the calligraphy, the food.... she is an avid cook, particularly of raw vegan food. As mentioned above, she has sung in many choirs, but she is currently taking a break from that so she can have more time with her three young children.     marta.fleischhansova@nyu.edu                                                                                           Tony Ackerman -Music Program Faculty Coordinator                               Tony Ackerman attended Harvard University, studied classical guitar in Italy for many years, and received a Ph.D. in Music Theory and Composition from the University of California at Santa Barbara.   His performing career as a guitarist has spanned over 40 years and many musical styles, including jazz, modern avant-garde art music, and American roots styles. After receiving an IREX grant to study Czech contemporary music in 1983, Ackerman remained in Prague, creating an original acoustic duo with the Czech jazz pianist Martin Kratochvil, combining the sounds of his 7-string guitar with Kratochvil\u2019s adventurous explorations on the grand piano. The duo, which has expanded to include multi-ethnic percussionist Imram Musa Zangi, has recorded nine albums and performed thousands of concerts in the Czech Republic and abroad.   Ackerman has taught music theory and history at UC Santa Barbara, and was music teacher and chair of the Fine Arts Department at the International School of Prague from 1985-2012. During this time he also taught Aural Comprehension at the NYU Prague campus (2006), and gives frequent lectures to visiting American university groups about Czech music, focusing on the underground music scene during the Communist 1980s.   tonyack3@gmail.com                     Internships                                                                              Jitka Kalasov\u00e1 - Internship Coordinator, Finance Administrator                               Jitka Kalasova started working for NYU Prague in 2002 to assist with finances.

Marta has been singing in various Prague choirs since she was a young child, and when Steinhardt College at NYU decided to set up a music program in Prague, she was the obvious choice for program coordinator.

After receiving an IREX grant to study Czech contemporary music in 1983, Ackerman remained in Prague, creating an original acoustic duo with the Czech jazz pianist Martin Kratochvil, combining the sounds of his 7-string guitar with Kratochvil\u2019s adventurous explorations on the grand piano.

His performing career as a guitarist has spanned over 40 years and many musical styles, including jazz, modern avant-garde art music, and American roots styles. After receiving an IREX grant to study Czech contemporary music in 1983, Ackerman remained in Prague, creating an original acoustic duo with the Czech jazz pianist Martin Kratochvil, combining the sounds of his 7-string guitar with Kratochvil\u2019s adventurous explorations on the grand piano. The duo, which has expanded to include multi-ethnic percussionist Imram Musa Zangi, has recorded nine albums and performed thousands of concerts in the Czech Republic and abroad.   Ackerman has taught music theory and history at UC Santa Barbara, and was music teacher and chair of the Fine Arts Department at the International School of Prague from 1985-2012. During this time he also taught Aural Comprehension at the NYU Prague campus (2006), and gives frequent lectures to visiting American university groups about Czech music, focusing on the underground music scene during the Communist 1980s.   tonyack3@gmail.com                     Internships                                                                              Jitka Kalasov\u00e1 - Internship Coordinator, Finance Administrator                               Jitka Kalasova started working for NYU Prague in 2002 to assist with finances.

She is still closely connected to the contemporary dance world and has coordinated dance workshops for NYU Prague students.   mh129@nyu.edu                                                                                      Jan Hovorka - Facilities Manager - Academic Center and Machova Residence                               Jan Hovorka- known by everyone on campus as Honza- started out at NYU Prague as an RA in the Machova dorm in 2005. He's now the Facilities Manager of Machova as well as of the NYU Academic Center. Honza has been working with NYU in New York to expand the IT networks all over our campus - a challenging task in 500 year-old buildings with Renaissance ceilings and strict building codes.   Jan comes from Marianske Lazne - also known as Marienbad - a spa town in the rolling hills of Western Bohemia. He acquired a love of basketball when he spent a year abroad as a high school student in Louisiana, and he's always up for shooting hoops with our students.   jh153@nyu.edu                                                                                      Maria Dzurnakova - Facilities Manager - Academic Center                               When she was a student at the Prague Economics University, Maria started coming to public lectures and discussions at NYU Prague. She was subsequently hired to be a Resident Assistant, then the Facilities Manager of the Osadni Dorm, and she is now one of the Facility Managers on campus.   Maria grew up in Slovakia and moved to the Czech Republic when she started university. In her spare time Maria plays the violin, is an avid painter, and recently has been spending a lot of time doing yoga.   md111@nyu.edu                          New York Site Representative                                           Miriam Halsey                               Study Away Advisor   Contact:     email: miriam.halsey@nyu.edu   phone: 212-992-9962                       Learn      Courses    Special Programs    Research Opportunities    Facilities    Faculty    Internships           Live      Housing &amp; Meals   Cost &amp; Budgeting    Language    Culture &amp; Customs    Health &amp; Safety    Staff           Explore      Getting Around   Restaurants    Nightlife    Things to do    Local Travel    Regional Travel                                                    NYU Centers Abroad...
