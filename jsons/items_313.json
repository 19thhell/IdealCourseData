Elective Courses    Asian American Literature    SCA-UA 306 Identical to ENGL-UA 716, COLIT-UA 301. Offered every year. 4 points.   This overview course examines the production of Asian American writing and literary/cultural criticism up to the present. Focuses on significant factors affecting the formation of Asian American literature and criticism, such as changing demographics of Asian American communities and the influence of ethnic, women's, and gay/lesbian/bisexual studies. Included is a variety of genres (poetry, plays, fiction and nonfiction, literary/cultural criticism, and nontraditional forms) by writers from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Explores the ways in which the writers treat issues such as racial and ethnic identity, immigration and assimilation, gender, class, sexuality, nationalism, culture and community, history and memory, and art and political engagement.    Cinema of Asia America    SCA-UA 310 Identical to EAST-UA 314, CINE-UT 315. Offered every other year. 4 points.   Begins with a critical history of misrepresentation and discrimination of Asians in Hollywood, then creates an arc of study that documents resistance and ultimately an undeniable and empowered presence. The second half of the semester focuses on a critical appreciation of contemporary Asian and Asian American film. Uses both screenings and readings and is divided into four areas of concentration: the history of misrepresentation in Hollywood films; the appropriation of Asian paradigms by Hollywood; the achievements of contemporary Asian American films; and the achievements of exemplary Asian filmmakers who have transcended regional and artistic borders.    History and Literatures of the South Asian Diaspora    SCA-UA 313 Identical to HIST-UA 326. Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduction to the history of the South Asian diaspora in the United States. Highlights work on South Asian immigrant communities in the United States and the little-known history of South Asian immigrants on the east coast of the United States in the context of historical migration to the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Offers a multidisciplinary perspective and uses classic as well as new works on South Asians in the United States from history, anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.    Asian/Pacific American Popular Culture    SCA-UA 320 Offered every third year. 4 points.   Examines the ways in which Asian/Pacific Americans have constituted and positioned their identities through various mediums of popular culture from the 1930s to the present. In particular, emphasizes popular institutions of representation, including music, theatre, fashion, television, and film, to examine the complex relationship between Asian/Pacific American representational practices and their material experiences in sociopolitical locations. In addition, considers the multiple and differentiated interpretive strategies of Asian American consumers of popular culture. How are Asian/Pacific American consumption and reception practices constituted differently across lines of class, gender, and sexuality?    Multiethnic New York    SCA-UA 363 Offered every two years. 4 points.   As a global city, New York is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse places in the world. In particular, the growth of migrant populations from Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean is driving the transformation of New York's economic, social, and political landscape. This course both explores the global socioeconomic conditions that facilitate and sustain these migrations and examines the cultural practices, imaginaries, and strategies of migrants as they become part of the city.    The Constitution and People of Color    SCA-UA 366 Identical to POL-UA 801, LWSOC-UA 327. Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines how the American legal system decided constitutional challenges affecting the empowerment of African, Latino, and Asian American communities from the 19th century to the present. Topics include the denial of citizenship and naturalization to slaves and immigrants, government-sanctioned segregation, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the prison industry, police brutality, post-9/11 detention issues, and voting rights. Course requirements include attendance at a community function involving constitutional issues, a midterm, and an interactive oral and written final project comparing a present-day issue affecting racial minorities in New York City and proposing measures to collectively address the issue.    Reading Race and Representation    SCA-UA 368 Parikh. Offered every year. 4 points.   Much contemporary public discourse characterizes race as a problem that some individuals \"have,\" or, even, a \"card\" that some people \"play.\" It is rarely recognized as a structural or material dimension that comprises everyday experience and knowledge. In this course, we ask what it means to \"read\" race in objects, spaces, and events that for the most part do not seem to be \"about\" race per se. The course is organized around a series of such topics, which we consider from an interdisciplinary perspective, engaging historical and legal texts, literature, and film, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history. Over the course of the semester, we address concepts and themes related to U.S. ethnic studies and critical race theory, including citizenship, rights, segregation, whiteness, colonialism, labor, migration, and alienness. The course provides an introduction to critical American studies as a field of scholarship that challenges our sense of the nation as socially and politically exceptional by asking what is forgotten or excluded in such a self-image.    \"Chinatown\" and the American Imagination: A Field Research Course    SCA-UA 370 Identical to IDSEM-UG 1229. Offered every other year. 4 points.   What is a \"Chinatown\"? The word alone evokes many images, sounds, smells, and tastes from many different sensibilities. For recent immigrants, it can be a home away from home; for \"outsiders,\" an exotic place for cheap eats; for male action-flick fans, Chow Yun-Fat (or Mark Wahlberg) in The Corruptor; and for you? (Fill in the blank.) We explore the nooks and crannies of Chinatown in the American imagination and in its New York real-time, nonvirtual existence. How do we know what we know and do not know? What does Chinatown have to do with the formation of normative \"American\" identities? What are the possibilities (and limits) of crossing cultural divides? Class members individually and/or in groups research, experience, and document a chain of persons, places, and/or events, creating their own narrative \"tour\" of this place's meanings. Novels, history books, tourist guides, films, and pop culture supplement the primary \"text\" of New York's Chinatown. This is a collaborative, discussion-intensive, field-research-driven class.    The Immigrant Imagination    SCA-UA 371 Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines contemporary immigration through the lens of visual culture. Explores a variety of expressive forms produced by migrant subjects\u2014including film, photography, art, and fashion\u2014and considers how these work to narrate the experiences of travel and displacement; home and exile; leisure and labor. In doing so, students consider how these visual representations seek to express the conditions of contemporary immigration in ways that co-exist with and counter dominant depictions. We ask: How do visual practices\u2014from filmmaking to graffitiing\u2014operate within immigrant communities as a mode of story-telling or world-making? How have immigrants employed visual culture to narrate their cross-cultural movements, community-building efforts, political struggles, and cultural memories?    Topics in A/P/A Studies    SCA-UA 380 Offered every semester. 4 points.   Specific topics vary from semester to semester. Former topics have included \"Yellow Peril\": Documenting and Understanding Xenophobia; Transnational Feminism; Cultural Politics of Food; and Politics of Fashion in the Asian Diaspora.
