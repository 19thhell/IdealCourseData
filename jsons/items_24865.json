Reading Recovery &reg; is an effective early literacy intervention that provides a second chance for students who do not get off to a good start in literacy learning. In 1989, NYU became the first Reading Recovery Teacher Leader Training site in the Northeast. 'Recovery' means getting back onto a successful learning path after a slow or difficult start and Reading Recovery is a short-term intervention designed to accelerate progress and lift achievement levels for the lowest performing first grade students. Students receive 30 minutes of daily, one-on-one instruction from a highly-trained Reading Recovery teacher for 12 to 20 weeks. In conjunction with good classroom instruction, Reading Recovery assists students who initially struggle with early literacy learning to reach grade-level performance in reading and writing in a remarkably short period of time and significantly reduces the number of children requiring additional services.    NYU now serves as the primary teacher leader training site for Reading Recovery in New York and New Jersey. Fairfax County, Virginia and Souderton, Pennsylvania are also affiliated to NYU. Since 1999, approximately 119,000 children have been served throughout the NYU site. NYU prepares teacher leaders who, following a year of graduate level coursework, are qualified to train Reading Recovery teachers in their local school districts or regions. The project is a cooperative venture between the university and a school district or a consortium of districts that have made the required long-term committment to implement Reading Recovery.    Descubriendo La Lectura (DLL) is the Spanish version of Reading Recovery. DLL works with the lowest performing first grade Spanish speaking students in reading and writing. The goal of this program is to enable these students to read and write within the average band of their bilingual classrooms.

I teach in a non-participating school. What can I do?    I am an NYU graduate student interested in the program. Can I take any classes?    I'm not currently working, but I'm hoping to re-enter the teaching profession. This looks like a great program. How can I get involved?    How do you know that children in Reading Recovery progress after they've completed their series of lessons? Do they continue to sustain their gains in later grades?    I'm an administrator who wants to bring Reading Recovery to my district and become a site. What does it cost and is there funding available?    My first grader is having trouble reading, but Reading Recovery is not available in our district. What can I do?       How do I become trained in Reading Recovery?    Reading Recovery is typically implemented across an entire school district. Two different levels of training are involved: teacher leader and Reading Recovery Teacher. When a district applies to become a site, they select potential candidate(s) to train as a teacher leader for their district. Teacher Leader candidates accepted by NYU enter into a year long in-service course. This is a full-time position and requires a release from other duties. In addition to coursework (16 graduate credits) trainees begin immediately teaching four children daily. On successful completion of the course, the new teacher leader returns to his/her school district to implement the program and conducts classes for Reading Recovery teachers in their district. Potential Reading Recovery teachers apply directly to the training site in his/her district or region. Reading Recovery teachers also begin teaching children immediately while completing coursework. The class for Reading Recovery teachers is one evening a week. Reading Recovery teachers receive 4 NYU graduate credits upon completion of their one-year program.    Back to Top    I teach in a non-participating school. What can I do?    You can get your school or district level administrators interested in the program. We would be happy to forward information to you, your principal or other administrators. We also have information sessions periodically for potential districts/sites to learn more first hand and even see the program in action.    Back to Top    I am an NYU graduate student interested in the program. Can I take any classes?    Yes. Reading Recovery Theory and Research course is open to NYU graduate students by special arrangement. However, at the completion of the course you will not be a trained Reading Recovery Teacher. For information, please contact the Reading Recovery office at 212-998-5210.    Back to Top     I'm not currently working, but I'm hoping to re-enter the teaching profession. This looks like a great program. How can I get involved?    You cannot be trained in Reading Recovery independently of a school or school system. Several books by Reading Recovery founder Marie Clay are available for purchase through Heinemann and The Reading Recovery Council of North America. These books are informative and used in Reading Recovery training.    Back to Top    How do you know that children in the program progress after they've completed lessons? Do they continue to sustain their gains in later grades?    Numerous follow-up studies of the Reading Recovery children (see Askew et al., 1998) demonstrate that a large majority of these children: a) continue to perform at or above national standards for the grade level performance in reading and writing, and, b) continue their reading progress at the levels very similar to their randomly selected classroom peers.    In an effort to reinforce these findings with their own data, many Reading Recovery school districts affiliated with New York University conduct follow-up studies every year, continually providing evidence on children's progress in the higher grades. For example, two New York City school districts in 1998 tested 148 second grade students who successfully completed the Reading Recovery program with Slosson Oral Reading Test. Seventy-two percent of them scored at or above grade level. Another district similarly found that sixty-two percent of third grade students and fifty-two percent in second grade students scored at or above the national average on the city-mandated CTB-Reading test. In Jersey City and Bridgewater-Raritan, New Jersey similar results have been reported. Additional results are summarized in the 2005-2006 Research Highlights for New York City and New Jersey , published by the Reading Recovery Project at New York University.    Back to Top    I'm an administrator who wants to bring the program to my district and become a site. What does it cost and is there funding available?    Costs include training services, supplies, construction of a training site with a one-way viewing mirror, and travel to conferences and institutes. This is not all inclusive and cost are subject to change. Please call the Reading Recovery Office at (212) 998-1998 for more information. From time to time NYU receives grants from private foundations which fund training in some districts. We are aware that cost is always an issue, however, we do not guarantee funding to any potential site as an incentive to train a teacher leader. Our experience has shown that a district can fund the program successfully from existing resources. Support of the superintendent, principals and other administrators is crucial to the program's development. Reading Recovery involves considerable up-front costs, but the long-term benefits to children are significant.    Back to Top    My first grader is having trouble reading, but there isn't a Reading Recovery program in our district. What can I do?    We do not offer private tutoring or evaluation through the NYU Reading Recovery Project. An option is the NYU Center for Reading Studies which offers free tutoring to students currently reading below grade level. Each child works one on one with a graduate student who is supervised by a professor. For more information, please contact the Reading Clinic at: (212) 998-1998. However, you may consider bringing Reading Recovery to the attention of your child's principal. If your efforts succeed in bringing the program to your school, your child will unfortunately not benefit since the teacher training is a year long process and the program is aimed only at first graders. You would have helped other children in your community who desperately need the help Reading Recovery offers.

I'm not currently working, but I'm hoping to re-enter the teaching profession. This looks like a great program. How can I get involved?    How do you know that children in Reading Recovery progress after they've completed their series of lessons? Do they continue to sustain their gains in later grades?    I'm an administrator who wants to bring Reading Recovery to my district and become a site. What does it cost and is there funding available?    My first grader is having trouble reading, but Reading Recovery is not available in our district. What can I do?       How do I become trained in Reading Recovery?    Reading Recovery is typically implemented across an entire school district. Two different levels of training are involved: teacher leader and Reading Recovery Teacher. When a district applies to become a site, they select potential candidate(s) to train as a teacher leader for their district. Teacher Leader candidates accepted by NYU enter into a year long in-service course. This is a full-time position and requires a release from other duties. In addition to coursework (16 graduate credits) trainees begin immediately teaching four children daily. On successful completion of the course, the new teacher leader returns to his/her school district to implement the program and conducts classes for Reading Recovery teachers in their district. Potential Reading Recovery teachers apply directly to the training site in his/her district or region. Reading Recovery teachers also begin teaching children immediately while completing coursework. The class for Reading Recovery teachers is one evening a week. Reading Recovery teachers receive 4 NYU graduate credits upon completion of their one-year program.    Back to Top    I teach in a non-participating school. What can I do?    You can get your school or district level administrators interested in the program. We would be happy to forward information to you, your principal or other administrators. We also have information sessions periodically for potential districts/sites to learn more first hand and even see the program in action.    Back to Top    I am an NYU graduate student interested in the program. Can I take any classes?    Yes. Reading Recovery Theory and Research course is open to NYU graduate students by special arrangement. However, at the completion of the course you will not be a trained Reading Recovery Teacher. For information, please contact the Reading Recovery office at 212-998-5210.    Back to Top     I'm not currently working, but I'm hoping to re-enter the teaching profession. This looks like a great program. How can I get involved?    You cannot be trained in Reading Recovery independently of a school or school system. Several books by Reading Recovery founder Marie Clay are available for purchase through Heinemann and The Reading Recovery Council of North America. These books are informative and used in Reading Recovery training.    Back to Top    How do you know that children in the program progress after they've completed lessons? Do they continue to sustain their gains in later grades?    Numerous follow-up studies of the Reading Recovery children (see Askew et al., 1998) demonstrate that a large majority of these children: a) continue to perform at or above national standards for the grade level performance in reading and writing, and, b) continue their reading progress at the levels very similar to their randomly selected classroom peers.    In an effort to reinforce these findings with their own data, many Reading Recovery school districts affiliated with New York University conduct follow-up studies every year, continually providing evidence on children's progress in the higher grades. For example, two New York City school districts in 1998 tested 148 second grade students who successfully completed the Reading Recovery program with Slosson Oral Reading Test. Seventy-two percent of them scored at or above grade level. Another district similarly found that sixty-two percent of third grade students and fifty-two percent in second grade students scored at or above the national average on the city-mandated CTB-Reading test. In Jersey City and Bridgewater-Raritan, New Jersey similar results have been reported. Additional results are summarized in the 2005-2006 Research Highlights for New York City and New Jersey , published by the Reading Recovery Project at New York University.    Back to Top    I'm an administrator who wants to bring the program to my district and become a site. What does it cost and is there funding available?    Costs include training services, supplies, construction of a training site with a one-way viewing mirror, and travel to conferences and institutes. This is not all inclusive and cost are subject to change. Please call the Reading Recovery Office at (212) 998-1998 for more information. From time to time NYU receives grants from private foundations which fund training in some districts. We are aware that cost is always an issue, however, we do not guarantee funding to any potential site as an incentive to train a teacher leader. Our experience has shown that a district can fund the program successfully from existing resources. Support of the superintendent, principals and other administrators is crucial to the program's development. Reading Recovery involves considerable up-front costs, but the long-term benefits to children are significant.    Back to Top    My first grader is having trouble reading, but there isn't a Reading Recovery program in our district. What can I do?    We do not offer private tutoring or evaluation through the NYU Reading Recovery Project. An option is the NYU Center for Reading Studies which offers free tutoring to students currently reading below grade level. Each child works one on one with a graduate student who is supervised by a professor. For more information, please contact the Reading Clinic at: (212) 998-1998. However, you may consider bringing Reading Recovery to the attention of your child's principal. If your efforts succeed in bringing the program to your school, your child will unfortunately not benefit since the teacher training is a year long process and the program is aimed only at first graders. You would have helped other children in your community who desperately need the help Reading Recovery offers.
