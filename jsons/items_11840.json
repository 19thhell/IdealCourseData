The principal objective of graduate training concerns the development of professional skills in historical research, and the principal source of professional employment for a holder of the PhD in history is teaching. The department seeks to prepare doctoral students for research and teaching, but we are also dedicated to preparing students for a variety of other careers, including public history and archival management.    The program includes 1) broad exposure to a general area of interest and its current literature and debates; 2) more intensive training in a special field, in which the student intends to conduct research and undertake his or her primary teaching; 3) a sound introduction to a second field; 4) training in research methodology; 5) appropriate linguistic competence; 6) completion of a dissertation judged to be a significant work of historical research and writing; 7) preparation for classroom teaching; 8) for those who so choose, ways of presenting historical knowledge in other settings.    Program Requirements are outlined in the PhD Handbook .
