In few places in the world is food more defining than in New Orleans. Like its music and architecture, New Orleans&rsquo; cuisine &ndash; a rich pastiche of Creole, Cajun, Afro-Caribbean, French, Spanish, and other influences &ndash; is nearly synonymous with the soul and culture of the city. Through firsthand immersion in the foodways of New Orleans, you&rsquo;ll spend a week exploring the ways in which culture, ethnicity, race, class, geography, and history mesh &ndash; and clash &ndash; to forge cultural meaning and identity. You&rsquo;ll also examine the serious challenges still faced by the people of New Orleans since the devastation of Katrina in 2005, and the economic, ecological, and cultural impact of the 2010 BP oil spill on the Gulf fisheries and seafood industry.

In few places in the world is food more defining than in New Orleans. Like its music and architecture, New Orleans&rsquo; cuisine &ndash; a rich pastiche of Creole, Cajun, Afro-Caribbean, French, Spanish, and other influences &ndash; is nearly synonymous with the soul and culture of the city. Through firsthand immersion in the foodways of New Orleans, you&rsquo;ll spend a week exploring the ways in which culture, ethnicity, race, class, geography, and history mesh &ndash; and clash &ndash; to forge cultural meaning and identity. You&rsquo;ll also examine the serious challenges still faced by the people of New Orleans since the devastation of Katrina in 2005, and the economic, ecological, and cultural impact of the 2010 BP oil spill on the Gulf fisheries and seafood industry.
