You will learn in an innovative environment and gain the skills needed to thrive in sectors such as alternative energy, physics-based nanotechnology, quantum mechanics, optical technology, health and wellness and global information technology. The MS Applied Physics program fosters an understanding of the evolution of the science and will emphasize modern advancements in physics, in addition to classical methods.   The graduate program in Applied Physics strongly supports research initiatives by students. With only two required courses, and manifold electives, the Master of Science in Applied Physics leaves opportunities open for student-conducted research projects inspired by the range of available coursework. There is no better time to continue to build upon your foundation of physics as the field changes both academically and professionally.   Admissions Requirements   A bachelor&rsquo;s degree with good academic standing in physics, applied physics or a closely-related discipline from an accredited college or university is required for admission to the applied physics graduate program. Applicants with degrees from fields other than physics or applied physics may be admitted, but must fulfill certain prerequisite courses before being considered for acceptance. These courses may include electromagnetism, modern physics, and/or mechanics. Students are expected to enter the program with at least an introductory background in physics, mathematics, chemistry and computer science. Undergraduate courses specified for this purpose cannot count toward credits needed for the master&rsquo;s degree. Letters of recommendation, GRE and TOEFL scores and application letters will also be considered in the admissions process.   Curriculum   To satisfy the requirements for the Master of Science degree in Applied Physics, the student must complete a minimum of 30 semester credits. Students are required to take six credits of basic courses, which include two 3-credit experiences: Quantum Mechanics and Graduate Seminar. In the Graduate Seminar, which is taken over two semesters, students present current topics in applied physics to their fellow students and supervising faculty. The remaining 24-credits will be earned from elective physics courses. Departmental electives include courses from the applied physics department at the 5000 and 6000 levels. The elective courses may include a 6-credit research project or a 9-credit thesis in physics. Choice of a research project or thesis option and elective courses must be made with the approval of the graduate adviser. Opportunities for work as research or graduate assistants are occasionally available in the applied physics department. With the approval of a graduate adviser, as many as 9 physics credits earned at another institution at the graduate level may be applied toward a student&rsquo;s degree. No comprehensive examination is required for the master&rsquo;s degree in applied physics. A student must hold a B/3.0 GPA at the time of graduation. The graduate applied physics program is flexible for working professionals, so courses will be offered primarily in the evening and only on the Brooklyn Campus.   Meeting the Demands for Professionals   The Master of Science program in Applied Physics at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering is an unparalleled advantage for professionals seeking to advance in today&rsquo;s leading physics positions. As technology continues to extend human life and harness new energy sources, those with extensive experience in applied physics are in high demand. NYU-Poly&rsquo;s multi-faceted applied physics curriculum will enable you to meet these challenges and go on to build a career in research or consulting for government or privately owned technology-based agencies.   NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering&mdash;New York&rsquo;s Most Comprehensive   Resource for Engineering, Applied Science, and Technology   Benefits of the MS in Applied Physics   This is your opportunity to learn from the best   You will benefit from NYU-Poly&rsquo;s highly respected faculty, made up of full-time and adjunct professors in applied physics from around the world. Departmental research is concentrated in areas of biophotonics, alternative energy sources, nanotechnology and nanoelectronics, quantum computing, terahertz sources and detectors, atomic and plasma physics, transport phenomena and optical physics. Faculty works closely with students to ensure an invested mentorship and extensive research experience. These individuals will help you excel in positions suited for those with a background in physics, including the emerging fields of health, green technology, energy conservation and nanotechnology research.   Tailored to meet today&rsquo;s challenges   Our programs will enable you to fill the growing need for applied physics specialists and excel in those positions. As research is continually needed for the discovery of better technology both for alternative sources of energy and human wellness, the Applied Physics department at NYU-Poly provides a diverse sampling of what the science of physics can be applied to, allowing you to use your strengths to make a contribution to solving the problems facing the world in the 21st century.   Classes will fit into your busy schedule   You will have the opportunity to take graduate courses at the main campus at MetroTech Center in downtown Brooklyn. To meet the needs of working professionals, courses are typically offered during evenings.   Locations   Applied Physics courses are available at the MetroTech Campus in downtown Brooklyn.   i2e at NYU-Poly   To meet the scientific and technological challenges of the 21st century, we at NYU-Poly will introduce you to a new mode of education we call &ldquo;i2e&rdquo;&mdash; invention, innovation and entrepreneurship. We are proposing that research universities have to expand to provide not just education, not just research, but also a continuity of activity that turns theory into application, and ideas into new companies. And by doing so, we will have a direct impact on economic growth, jobs and prosperity of our cities.
