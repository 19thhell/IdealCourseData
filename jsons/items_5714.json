This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    global outreach opportunities Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM                                                  Second Year                               Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course. The course enables the student to record the       patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and       periapical tissue evaluation. The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic       origin. An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for       establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis.                       Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities. The       biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented. The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are       introduced.                        Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component)         A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root       canal access, instrumentation and obturation. Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture       covering the goals and objectives for each exercise. Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand       and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises.

The       information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease.       Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of       prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed.   Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care       under faculty supervision. Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities       are emphasized.                                                              Fourth Year                               Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic       needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases.

They will also be able to participate in research and be motivated to include service to disadvantaged populations.   The Advanced Education Program in Endodontics selects highly motivated candidates to receive two years of extensive clinical and biomedical education together with experience in teaching and research. The program accepts 10 students a year with a total of 20 students enrolled in the program. The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and has consistently attracted outstanding candidates.                                                    Didactic Program                               The didactic portion of the program consists of basic science and departmental courses. The departmental instruction includes lecture and textbook review (first year), classic literature review (first and second years), current literature review (first and second year), endodontic surgery, and an extensive number of basic sciences. Examinations are conducted in all courses. The didactic portion of the program emphasizes the biological basis of endodontics.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program covers an interdisciplinary approach to nonsurgical and surgical endodontics. Case conferences and interdisciplinary seminars are regularly conducted. Varied instrumentation and obturation techniques are taught in the program by faculty members and guest lecturers. During the first year of the program surgical didactic material is presented. Surgical cases of various types are part of the student's clinical experiences. Students take didactic and pre-clinical courses in implant dentistry during their first year and receive clinical instruction in implant dentistry in their second year. Students participate in outreach programs to underserved areas. The Endodontic Postgraduate Clinic is equipped with 20 chairs for 20 students, 16 operating surgical microscopes and two endoscopes. Hospital rotations augment the student's clinical experiences.                                                              Research Program                               Research is a requirement for graduation. All students gain experience in research by participating in clinical or basic science research projects. Research advisers are selected from clinical or basic science departments. The research program has received national recognition.                                                              Teaching Program                               Teaching experiences are a part of the program and a requirement for all students. Teaching undergraduate dental students provides our post-graduate students with experiences that may be a motivating factor in the inclusion of education as part of their career plans.                                                              Length of the Program                               The program is two full calendar years (24 months) beginning on July 1st of each year.

This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    global outreach opportunities Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM                                                  Second Year                               Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course. The course enables the student to record the       patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and       periapical tissue evaluation. The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic       origin. An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for       establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis.                       Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities. The       biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented. The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are       introduced.                        Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component)         A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root       canal access, instrumentation and obturation. Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture       covering the goals and objectives for each exercise. Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand       and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises.                                                              Third Year                               Advanced Endodontics         This course, for third-year dental students, consists of a series of lectures on advanced endodontic topics. The       information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease.       Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of       prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed.   Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care       under faculty supervision. Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities       are emphasized.                                                              Fourth Year                               Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic       needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases.                 Honors in Endodontics         This course is offered to a small group of highly motivated students with a high level of academic achievement who are       particulary interested in endodontics. This course presents a series of lectures and seminars on advanced and current       endodontic topics that incorporate the biology of endodontic disease and the comprehensive clinical management of       complex endodontic cases.

They will also be able to participate in research and be motivated to include service to disadvantaged populations.   The Advanced Education Program in Endodontics selects highly motivated candidates to receive two years of extensive clinical and biomedical education together with experience in teaching and research. The program accepts 10 students a year with a total of 20 students enrolled in the program. The program is fully accredited by the Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association and has consistently attracted outstanding candidates.                                                    Didactic Program                               The didactic portion of the program consists of basic science and departmental courses. The departmental instruction includes lecture and textbook review (first year), classic literature review (first and second years), current literature review (first and second year), endodontic surgery, and an extensive number of basic sciences. Examinations are conducted in all courses. The didactic portion of the program emphasizes the biological basis of endodontics.                                                              Clinical Program                               The clinical component of the program covers an interdisciplinary approach to nonsurgical and surgical endodontics. Case conferences and interdisciplinary seminars are regularly conducted. Varied instrumentation and obturation techniques are taught in the program by faculty members and guest lecturers. During the first year of the program surgical didactic material is presented. Surgical cases of various types are part of the student's clinical experiences. Students take didactic and pre-clinical courses in implant dentistry during their first year and receive clinical instruction in implant dentistry in their second year. Students participate in outreach programs to underserved areas. The Endodontic Postgraduate Clinic is equipped with 20 chairs for 20 students, 16 operating surgical microscopes and two endoscopes. Hospital rotations augment the student's clinical experiences.                                                              Research Program                               Research is a requirement for graduation. All students gain experience in research by participating in clinical or basic science research projects. Research advisers are selected from clinical or basic science departments. The research program has received national recognition.                                                              Teaching Program                               Teaching experiences are a part of the program and a requirement for all students. Teaching undergraduate dental students provides our post-graduate students with experiences that may be a motivating factor in the inclusion of education as part of their career plans.                                                              Length of the Program                               The program is two full calendar years (24 months) beginning on July 1st of each year.
