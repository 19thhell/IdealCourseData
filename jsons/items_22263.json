The degree also features a concentration, in either public relations management or corporate and organizational communication; a practicum project in which you prepare, present, and potentially launch a communication plan that meets a real need for a real organization; and a capstone project, which is a publication-ready thesis paper that makes an original contribution to the field.   The program is designed to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either part-time or full-time study in any semester. It can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.

Customer experience, online communities, and social networking have created the need for PR professionals with a very different set of skills than those of their predecessors.   For the public relations industry, the greatest challenge today is the dearth of new talent\u2014the demand for PR professionals is growing faster than the talent pool. According to the Public Relations Society of America, spending on public relations increased substantially in 2010, and is forecast to go up to $8.1 billion over the next five years.       That\u2019s why the M.S in Public Relations and Corporate Communication is so critical. Through this program and its innovative curriculum, we are teaching and are graduating high-caliber students who will satisfy the increasing demand for PR professionals. These individuals must be well versed in industry trends and must be able to apply new technology and new methods of communication to develop and to implement effective public relations plans.

The degree also features a concentration, in either public relations management or corporate and organizational communication; a practicum project in which you prepare, present, and potentially launch a communication plan that meets a real need for a real organization; and a capstone project, which is a publication-ready thesis paper that makes an original contribution to the field.   The program is designed to meet the needs of both working professionals and full-time students, allowing opportunities for either part-time or full-time study in any semester. It can be completed in two years of full-time study, or in up to five years of part-time study.   The program, though mainly classroom-based, also is making important strides with distance learning, especially with respect to the pedagogical methodologies that will work best in what has been called &quot;The Age of the Conversation.&quot;           Expand All   Collapse All          Core Curriculum        The core curriculum is designed to provide you with a deep and broad foundation that supports concentration coursework and serves you throughout your career.

Customer experience, online communities, and social networking have created the need for PR professionals with a very different set of skills than those of their predecessors.   For the public relations industry, the greatest challenge today is the dearth of new talent\u2014the demand for PR professionals is growing faster than the talent pool. According to the Public Relations Society of America, spending on public relations increased substantially in 2010, and is forecast to go up to $8.1 billion over the next five years.       That\u2019s why the M.S in Public Relations and Corporate Communication is so critical. Through this program and its innovative curriculum, we are teaching and are graduating high-caliber students who will satisfy the increasing demand for PR professionals. These individuals must be well versed in industry trends and must be able to apply new technology and new methods of communication to develop and to implement effective public relations plans.
