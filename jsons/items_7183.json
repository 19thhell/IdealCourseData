As we do so, we will ask how these letters let us understand the problem of \u201cdistance\u201d in emotional, aesthetic, political, narratological, and geographical terms. Of particular interest to us will be how the epistolary form accounts for the scenes of its composition and represents the circumstances and space around the act of writing: In what ways does the epistolary novel (along with collections of letters of the period) imagine travel and contact with other cultures? What exactly is the \u201creaderly\u201d intimacy letters create, and how do these strategies portray and construct gender? How do these letters depict strangers, foreigners, and other \u201cothers,\u201d and how do they address or confront the public? We will think about how the letter reinforces norms of behavior and how the letter wages protest. Our readings will take us across the European and Anglo-American traditions and, more locally, to the Wrightsman Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where we will consider the domestic spaces and objects that inform some exemplars of this literary form. Finally, we will conclude our inquiry with a look at the epistolary form\u2019s 21st-century afterlife. How might \u201cdistance\u201d and dissent change when epistles travel by fiber-optics rather than horseback?

Her research focuses on the literature, philosophy, and political theory of early modernity and the Enlightenment, with additional interests in poetics, psychoanalysis, and critical theory. Her current book project, Cartesian Poetics, investigates the charge that Descartes \u201ccut the throat of poetry,\u201d showing how an often-unsettling engagement with poetry and poetics haunts and shapes the Cartesian legacy developed in the Meditations and the Discourse \u2013 a tradition handed down through the Enlightenment to modernity. Andrea has also taught classes in the Department of Comparative Literature at UC Berkeley and, through the Prison University Project, at San Quentin State Prison. At NYU, she holds a joint appointment with the Department of Comparative Literature.                                     top of page                                     Contact Information     Andrea Gadberry             Assistant Professor              andrea.gadberry@nyu.edu             1 Wash Pl, Room 530             (212) 992-6321      Download as vCard           \u00a0           Office Hours         Monday (3:30-7:30 by appt)                                                               Courses                                                   2015             Spring                            Proximity and Protest in the 18th-Century Letter and its Afterlives                  Mon,Wed      2:00 PM -      3:15 PM                                    Comparative Melancholies                  Mon,Wed      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                                   2015             Fall                            Enlightenment Subjects and Subjections                  Tue,Thu      9:30 AM -      10:45 AM                                                   2014             Fall                            First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar: The Chains of Command: Authority and Obedience                  Mon,Wed      2:00 PM -      3:15 PM                                       Research and Teaching Interests       comparative early modern and Enlightenment studies (English, French, Latin); philosophy and political theory, 1600-1800; genre; poetics; psychoanalysis; critical theory                                                                                                              NYU Gallatin Footer              Gallatin School of Individualized Study     1 Washington Place     New York, NY 10003     (212) 998-7370                   A&#8211;Z Index      Directions      Contact Us      Job Opportunities               News      Support Gallatin      Feedback                         Follow us on Facebook      Follow us on Twitter      Follow us on Youtube         Follow us Instagram                 Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright NYU Gallatin.

As we do so, we will ask how these letters let us understand the problem of \u201cdistance\u201d in emotional, aesthetic, political, narratological, and geographical terms. Of particular interest to us will be how the epistolary form accounts for the scenes of its composition and represents the circumstances and space around the act of writing: In what ways does the epistolary novel (along with collections of letters of the period) imagine travel and contact with other cultures? What exactly is the \u201creaderly\u201d intimacy letters create, and how do these strategies portray and construct gender? How do these letters depict strangers, foreigners, and other \u201cothers,\u201d and how do they address or confront the public? We will think about how the letter reinforces norms of behavior and how the letter wages protest. Our readings will take us across the European and Anglo-American traditions and, more locally, to the Wrightsman Galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art where we will consider the domestic spaces and objects that inform some exemplars of this literary form. Finally, we will conclude our inquiry with a look at the epistolary form\u2019s 21st-century afterlife. How might \u201cdistance\u201d and dissent change when epistles travel by fiber-optics rather than horseback? Major texts include: Samuel Richardson,\u00a0 Pamela \u00a0(1741), Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,\u00a0 The Sorrows of Young Werther \u00a0(1774), Denis Diderot,\u00a0 The Nun \u00a0(1780), Montesquieu, Persian Letters (1721), Lady Mary Montagu, Turkish Embassy Letters (1763), and Helen Maria Williams,\u00a0 Letters Written in France \u00a0(1790).
