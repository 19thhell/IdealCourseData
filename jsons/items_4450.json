(Gallatin Building), Rm. 801        Course Description   Many of our modern ideas about art, literature, architecture and its uses, politics, culture, philosophy, gender, and class derive from the brilliantly prolific period of the Renaissance.   During a three-week interdisciplinary program in beautiful and historic Florence, Italy, students will be offered a total immersion and multifaceted learning experience that is an essential beginning to understanding our modern world through the lens of the Italian Renaissance. This course explores the literature, culture, art, and thought of the Renaissance from multiple perspectives.   During their stay, students will develop and present an individualized project based on their academic interests and background and the ways in which the Renaissance has inspired them. As a quintessential Gallatin experience, the course places emphasis on the cultural and historical contexts from which the literature and art of Renaissance Florence emerged.   Readings might include the works of Dante, Pico Della Mirandola, Machiavelli, and selected female writers, as well as art texts such as Vasari's The Lives of the Artists . In addition, students will study the art of Florentine painters such as Botticelli, Giotto, and Michelangelo in the places where these works were created.   Classes are taught in English and meet four days a week. Throughout the course, students will visit museums and churches such as the Uffizi, the Duomo, the church of Santa Maria Novella, and the monastery of San Marco to engage fully with the art and architecture of Renaissance Italy.   Students are required to reside in accommodations arranged by NYU Gallatin.   Note for Gallatin students: This course fulfills 4 credits of the Interdisciplinary Seminar as well as the Humanities and Early Modern foundation requirements.        Eligibility   This course is open to undergraduate and graduate students of all NYU and non-NYU schools.

Bio &amp; Publications           About the Course   This course is a survey of American literature and literary history, from the early colonial period to the eve of the Civil War. Our goal will be to acquire a grasp of the canon of American literature as it is typically conceived and the various logics behind its construction.          Key Topics   Topics to be considered include: the rise of \u201cliterature\u201d as a discipline unto itself; the meaning of American individualism; the conflict between liberty and equality in American social thought; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the relation between history and cultural mythology; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; the American obsession with race; the ideology of domesticity and its link to the sentimental; the aesthetics of American romance; the role of biography in literary criticism and historiography; the nature of the \u201cAmerican Renaissance\u201d; what it means to say \u201cNO in thunder!\u201d and why so many American writers seem to say it; deliberative democracy and cosmopolitanism.

(Gallatin Building), Rm. 801        Course Description   Many of our modern ideas about art, literature, architecture and its uses, politics, culture, philosophy, gender, and class derive from the brilliantly prolific period of the Renaissance.   During a three-week interdisciplinary program in beautiful and historic Florence, Italy, students will be offered a total immersion and multifaceted learning experience that is an essential beginning to understanding our modern world through the lens of the Italian Renaissance. This course explores the literature, culture, art, and thought of the Renaissance from multiple perspectives.   During their stay, students will develop and present an individualized project based on their academic interests and background and the ways in which the Renaissance has inspired them. As a quintessential Gallatin experience, the course places emphasis on the cultural and historical contexts from which the literature and art of Renaissance Florence emerged.   Readings might include the works of Dante, Pico Della Mirandola, Machiavelli, and selected female writers, as well as art texts such as Vasari's The Lives of the Artists . In addition, students will study the art of Florentine painters such as Botticelli, Giotto, and Michelangelo in the places where these works were created.   Classes are taught in English and meet four days a week. Throughout the course, students will visit museums and churches such as the Uffizi, the Duomo, the church of Santa Maria Novella, and the monastery of San Marco to engage fully with the art and architecture of Renaissance Italy.   Students are required to reside in accommodations arranged by NYU Gallatin.

What does literature mean today?\u201d but ask them today undetermined by preexisting \u201cisms,\u201d past the dogmas of recent years, post-Post, as it were. RE-THINKING LITERATURE seeks new, multiple perspectives for the meaning and significance of the cultural construct \u201cliterature\u201d today\u2014and examines how a younger generation of literary thinkers and practitioners deals with it.
