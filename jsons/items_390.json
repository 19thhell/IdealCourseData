These are variously housed in the Classics Department, the Institute of Fine Arts, and the Fales Library (the Special Collections department of Bobst Library). Most of these art objects have been published in the catalogue Classical Antiquities at New York University , edited by Larissa Bonfante and Blair Fowlkes. For a partial online inventory (with texts) of NYU\u2019s papyri, see the Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri . Also, the inscriptions, while not yet fully published, can be accessed via the internet through the US Epigraphy Project .    Library Resources    Together, Bobst Library and the Institute of Fine Art s have extensive holdings of books, journals, and online resources covering all aspects of antiquity. The libraries offer access to standard journal collections such as JSTOR, and participate in cooperative digitizing projects such as the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS). The holdings of NYU\u2019s libraries are particularly strong in archaeology, papyrology, and primary sources. In addition, the Special Collections Department of Bobst Library has a large number of early printed editions of the classics. NYU\u2019s library resources are supplemented by the outstanding collections of the New York Public Library, as well as neighborhood universities, museums, and learned societies."}, {"content": "Program of Study    | Classics | NYU                                                          Back to  previous page                  Program of Study (CAS Bulletin)   Majors Classics (Latin and Ancient Greek) This major requires a total of 40 points (typically ten 4-point courses). Students should note that courses in modern Greek language do not count toward completion of this major. The courses to be counted toward the major must include both ancient Greek and Latin through the intermediate two level (CLASS-UA 10 and CLASS-UA 6, respectively, or the equivalent) and at least one advanced course in both ancient Greek and Latin or two advanced courses in either one of these languages. Classical Civilization This major requires a total of 40 points (typically ten 4-point courses). Students should note that courses in modern Greek language do not count toward completion of this major. The courses to be counted toward the major must include either ancient Greek or Latin through the intermediate two level (CLASS-UA 10 or CLASS-UA 6, respectively, or the equivalent). Students must complete at least two language courses in residence at NYU. Classics and Art History (with Emphasis on Archaeology) This interdepartmental major requires two years of college-level ancient Greek or Latin or the equivalent, and six 4-point courses in classical archaeology and art history to include Archaic and Classical Art: Greek and Etruscan (ARTH-UA 102), Hellenistic and Roman Art (ARTH-UA 103), and four others selected from applicable courses, including those in Egyptian and Near Eastern art. This is a flexible major designed to accommodate special interests and requirements. Advanced-level courses in practical archaeology may be taken for credit. Classical Civilization and Anthropology This interdepartmental major may follow one of two tracks, each requiring 20 points (five 4-point courses) from the Department of Anthropology and 20 points (five 4-point courses) from the Department of Classics. The first track focuses on archaeology and the second track on cultural anthropology. Specific course programs should be devised in consultation with the directors of undergraduate studies in both departments. For more detail and specific requirements, see under Anthropology in this Bulletin. Classical Civilization and Hellenic Studies This joint major offers the possibility of two different tracks. Both tracks require a total of 40 points (ten 4-point courses). For a list of courses in Hellenic studies, see the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies in this Bulletin. Track A requires ancient Greek through the full intermediate level (typically four 4-point courses), two 4-point courses from the offerings in classical civilization (below), and four 4-point courses offered through the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. Track B requires modern Greek through the full intermediate level (typically four 4-point courses), two 4-point courses from the offerings of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies, and four 4-point courses from the offerings in classical civilization (below). (Note: A student already proficient through the first- or second-year level of modern Greek will take two or four courses in place of the first and/or second year of modern Greek, with the consent of the appropriate faculty.)    Minors Latin and Greek This minor requires 20 points (five 4-point courses) to be selected from the offerings of the department. (Courses in elementary languages, modern Greek language, and Hellenic studies do not count toward completion of this minor.) As part of this minor, students must take either Latin or ancient Greek at least through the intermediate two level (CLASS-UA 6 or CLASS-UA 10, respectively). At least two of the required courses in ancient Greek or Latin must be taken in residence at NYU. Classical Civilization This minor requires 20 points (five 4-point courses) to be selected from the department's offerings in Latin, ancient Greek, or classical civilization. (Courses in modern Greek language and Hellenic studies do not count toward completion of this minor.)    Honors Program    Students may receive a degree with honors in classics or classical civilization. Honors recognition requires a 3.65 average overall, an average of 3.65 in all classics courses, participation in an Honors Seminar (normally in the fall of the senior year, CLASS-UA 295), and a completed honors thesis, which is written in the context of the fall seminar and a follow-up independent Senior Honors course (CLASS-UA 297) under the supervision of the student's chosen thesis supervisor.
