Coplan, instructor         This course  reviews various approaches and topic areas in the anthropology of popular culture  and performance studies, and integrates approaches from media and cultural  studies with the study of performance in contemporary anthropology. Theories of  the construction and study of culture are applied to the understanding of  performance, media, and creative processes in global social contexts. A  particular focus is upon the relationships between international movements and  local appropriations in cultural production. Among the forms and media under  examination are mass public ritual, indigenous genres, popular politics, sports  and carnival spectacles, popular performing arts, theatre, photography, film,  the Internet, and ethnography itself as \u201cperformance.\u201d Students learn how to  interpret and analyze systems, processes, events, and works of performance both  in mass culture industries and in the contemporary societies that surround  them.        Youth and Hollywood Cinema    IOART-UT 116 4 units | Haseenah Ebrahim, instructor      This course  explores several different aspects of popular (mainstream) \ufb01lms produced for  children or young people or as \u201cfamily entertainment\u201d: (1) Hollywood\u2019s  reproduction of dominant American ideologies of race, gender, the family, and  individualism in these \ufb01lms; (2) their role in the construction of children as  consumers through the development of \u201cconsumption webs\u201d; and (3) the political  economy of youth-oriented \ufb01lms, such as anime and Hollywood, the  Disney-Dreamworks rivalry, the Pixar-Disney relationship, etc.      Films to be studied  include: Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , Beauty and the Beast , The  Lion King , Antz , Pocahontas , The Little Mermaid , Toy  Story , Aladdin , Harry Potter , Shrek , and High  School Musical. Elementary Zulu Language and Culture    IOART-UT 76 4 units | Muntu Eve Mothibe, instructor      This is an  introductory course designed for students who have no knowledge of IsiZulu. The  course aims to familiarize students with speaking, reading, writing, and  hearing IsiZulu with special emphasis in Zulu culture. An understanding of  grammatical structures is gradually introduced through the close reading of  simple graded texts. Students are taught to function in situations that require  basic knowledge of IsiZulu.        Contemporary South African Theatre    IOART-UT 368 4 units | Greg Homann, instructor      This course  contextualizes contemporary South African theatre practice by considering a  broad range of topics. The objective is to highlight debates across a spectrum  of current critical thinking within post-apartheid South African society. The  course begins by detailing an overview of South African theatre from 1955 to  the present day. A definition of Western theatre traditions and African  performance, both of which underpin current theatre practice in South Africa,  is offered. Key areas of exploration include; narrative and thematic trends,  issues of identity politics, nationalism, democracy, form and content,  adaptation, depictions of violence, and notions of the victim, the perpetrator  and the hero as well as the manner in which play and performance texts serve to  critique, as much as to document, a historical period. Special emphasis is  given to the sociopolitical context in which theatre has been produced. This  includes the State of Emergency (when theatre was being illegally produced  across cultural and racial barriers).        Community-Based Theatre    ITHEA-UT 369 4 units | Sara Matchett, instructor This  course focuses on the theoretical understanding and practical application of  applied drama and theatre processes operating within educational, community and  other site specific settings. Students will engage with Augusto Boal\u2019s Theatre  of the Oppressed (TO) theories and practices in particular, and other  contemporary theatre intervention processes. Theatre of the Oppressed will be  understood as inclusive of Image Theatre, Forum Theatre, Legislative Theatre  and Rainbow of Desire. Students are expected to develop sound theoretical  grounding of Boalian and related intervention modes such as Enhanced Forum  Theatre and Theatre for Development which they are then expected to apply in  practice within formal and/or informal community settings.           The Director and the Mise-en-Scene 4 units | Greg Homann, coordinator Prerequisite: Directing experience or equivalent. This  course focuses on bringing together text, style and the aesthetics of directing  for theatre. The aim of the course is to develop a directorial \u201csignature\u201d with  a particular focus on understanding storytelling techniques. Students will  explore various approaches to directing for non-realist theatre. Reading and research  involves looking at a number of different practitioners and directors, related  to developing students directing skills, widening their directorial vocabulary,  and engaging with the Mise-en-scene. The primary task of the semester is to construct a 10-20 piece of theatre, using acting students as your cast.         *Courses subject to change.
