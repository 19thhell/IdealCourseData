NYUAD Institute has embarked on a multi-year research fellowship program in the Humanities. This program aims to help create an energetic, multi-faceted research environment for the Humanities at NYUAD's campus. To this end, NYUAD is annually inviting applications from distinguished senior scholars as well as from promising junior scholars for residential fellowships at NYUAD\u2019s Institute. Fellows are contributing to NYUAD's intellectual community through research and research-related activities, including sharing their work-in-progress with NYUAD faculty and students and participating in scholarly networks engaged in ongoing research centered at the NYUAD Institute.     While open to scholars working in all areas of the Humanities, the program aims in particular to build a center of outstanding research capacity in areas of the Humanities that are relevant for the study of the Arabic world, its rich intellectual, religious, and scientific history, its cultural and artistic heritage as expressed in traditional and new media, and its interaction with other cultures in the past and present. Scholars of Arabic culture and history will find it enriching to work alongside fellows who conduct research in related and adjacent fields. Scholarship furthered by this program is closely connected to the research profile of NYUAD's faculty in the Arts &amp; Humanities; its Liberal Arts curriculum, with concentrations on History, Literature, Philosophy, the Arab Crossroads program, and Museum Studies; related departments and research centers at NYU New York; and NYUAD's outreach program in the UAE.                               Awards &amp; Facilities   The Institute is hosting up to two senior fellows and up to four junior fellows.         For the period of their fellowships, scholars are offered work/office space at the Institute, full use of NYUAD's library facilities (which are substantial, closely connected as they are to NYU's Main Library in New York), administrative support, housing at NYUAD's campus on Saadiyat Island, a fellowship stipend commensurate with experience, a personal research allowance, support for travel to and from Abu Dhabi. Fellowship recipients are responsible for conforming to tax requirements of their home countries.                               Start Date &amp; Duration   September 1, 2015 or February 1, 2016        Scholars may apply for one- or two-semester fellowships                             Candidate Qualifications   Eligible candidates for the senior fellowships have an outstanding scholarly accomplishment, including an internationally recognized publication record. Mid-career scholars with strong publication records and exceptional scholarly promise may be considered in this category. Eligible candidates for the junior fellowships, which are intended especially for young scholars who wish to turn their doctoral dissertations into book manuscripts publishable with major academic presses, have received their Ph.D. within the previous five years and have a strong record of scholarly accomplishment.   All research fellowships will be offered to scholars who demonstrate interest in playing an active role in the intellectual community of NYUAD, in particular by exchanging ideas with other Institute fellows and with NYU faculty and students. The fellowships are open to scholars of all backgrounds and nationalities.                               Research Community Involvement       Fellows are expected to play an active role in the intellectual life of the NYUAD campus. All fellows are required to participate in the bi-weekly Humanities Research Seminar, a colloquium for the discussion of pre-circulated research papers. In addition to presentations by fellows, the Humanities Research Seminar may feature presentations by NYUAD faculty, other NYU faculty who are in residence at NYUAD, UAE scholars, and other invited speakers. Seminar sessions will also be open to graduate students and a select group of undergraduate students from NYUAD and to UAE-based scholars with relevant expertise. In addition to participating in the Seminar, fellows may be invited to contribute to the Institute's community outreach program, for example by serving as invited speakers in the public evening lecture program or participating in one of the international workshops organized by the Institute. Fellows may also be asked on occasion to serve informally as mentors to scholars engaged in research in areas of their expertise. Junior fellows may request the opportunity to teach a course at NYUAD and may apply for teaching opportunities at NYUAD following their fellowships.

Our Current Fellows                                       Expand all [+] Collapse all [-]                                      J. Andrew Bush            J. Andrew Bush joined NYUAD in September 2014 as a Research Fellow in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. He has conducted ethnographic research with Iraqi Kurds for more than 10 years in the United States and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, spanning topics such as religion, literature, gender and kinship, nationalism, and violence. His abiding interest lies in how textual fragments from religious discourses are received and reworked in the intimate relationships that make up everyday life. His dissertation research focused on the everyday ethics of Muslims in Kurdistan who turn away from pietistic aspirations while at the same time citing Sufi poetry and sustaining intimate relations with more pious Muslims. Building on that work, he is drafting a book manuscript, tentatively titled A Threadbare Prayer Mat: Sufi Poetry and the Texture of Everyday life in Kurdistan, that provides an ethnographic account of poetry\u2019s appearance in ordinary life. The manuscript is itself an experiment in rendering the texture of life in prose that is interspersed with poetry. Engaging theories of religion, ethics, and desire, he argues that everyday life in Kurdistan engenders and sustains a broad range of paradoxes that are not yet acknowledged in studies of religious life.     His interest in the deeper history of poetry\u2019s fragmentation and recontextualization in Kurdistan led him to the epistolary letters (saturated with classical Persian poetry) of Mawlana Khalid Naqshbandi, an early 19th century revivalist figure who inspired a renaissance of Sorani Kurdish poetry. While at NYU Abu Dhabi, he will broaden this historical perspective by examining two further archives that open windows onto the lives of ordinary Muslims in Kurdistan who turn away from pietism. One is the transformation of non-Muslim figures of thought in Sorani Kurdish poetry over the past two centuries. Tracing figures such as Jesus, the Christian boy, the Zoroastrian priest, and the Jewish maiden, he asks how the attraction of their heretical potential changed as new religious discourses emerged in Kurdistan. The second archive was formed around the \u2018jihadi\u2019 Islamist movements that developed in Kurdistan in the second half of the twentieth century. Here he focuses on sermons\u2014poetic texts punctuated with poetry\u2014recorded during a peak of Islamists\u2019 armed struggle in Kurdistan in the 1990\u2019s. Analyzing such discourse in the context of larger processes of secularization and the violence of the Ba\u2019athist regime, he also examines the forms of skepticism and disappointment that discourse engendered among many ordinary Muslims in Kurdistan.   In addition to ethnographic surveys of the Middle East and approaches to critical Muslim intellectual traditions, he has taught courses on Western receptions of Islamicate literature, and on marriage and masculinity in Muslim societies. Inspired by new ethnographic research he conducted in 2014 on marriage and divorce proceedings in Kurdistan, he looks forward to developing courses on the mutual absorptions of everyday life and shari\u2019a, or Islamic \u2018law.\u2019                                Dale Stahl            Dale joined NYUAD in September 2014, as a Research Fellow in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. His scholarly interests center on the history of the Middle East during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Broadly, he is interested in how changes in the environment resulting from both human and non-human action relate to social and political change. His current research deals with water and hydraulic engineering in the Tigris-Euphrates basin during the early and middle part of the twentieth century. The human handling and exploitation of Mesopotamia\u2019s water has had a profound impact on the formation of political communities in the rivers\u2019 basin for millennia, but the period of modern development has received very little attention from historians. In his dissertation, he examined the action of both nature (in the form of floods and droughts) and human hydraulic management to explain how the environment figured into the shift from empire to nation-state and the diverse processes of modern state formation in Iraq, Syria and Turkey. His work has been heavily influenced by research in various fields of social science especially geography. After his fellowship year at NYUAD, he will join the history faculty at the University of Colorado Denver as an Assistant Professor of International Studies.                                 Marcel Kurpershoek            Marcel Kurpershoek will be joining NYUAD in January 2015 as Senior Research Fellow in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. His research subject is Nabati poetry, a traditional art in the Gulf and the Arabian peninsula. Its roots go back to the pre-Islamic classical Arabic poetry of famous bards like Imru \u2018l Qays. His fieldwork started in 1989 in central-Arabia, at the edge of the Empty Quarter, where he found illiterate poets who were great masters of this poetry\u2019s more recent Nabati version, with vernacular elements. These poems he recorded and published with a translation, introductions, and glossaries in five volumes, Oral Poetry &amp; Narratives from Central Arabia (Brill Publishers). He wrote about his fieldwork in Dutch books that were translated into English (Arabia of the Bedouins) and Arabic (al-Badawi al-Akhir, The Last Bedouin both Saqi Books). In Abu Dhabi he will study the links between Nabati poetry in inner Arabia (Najd) and the Gulf litoral. In addition, he will work on tv competitions like the Million\u2019s Poet. He has participated in workshops at NYUAD and contributed some articles on the subject in The National newspaper of Abu Dhabi. He has worked as a Dutch diplomat in Egypt (where he did his PhD on modern Egyptian literature), Syria, Saudi-Arabia, and as Netherlands ambassador in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Turkey, Poland and currently as Dutch special representative for Syria based in Istanbul.     Articles       Ancient Bedouin verse, the \u2018people\u2019s poetry\u2019, has found a new audience (The National - Nov. 7, 2013)       Poetry TV programmes a sign of a new Arab world? (The National - June 27, 2013)      Using poetry to take a stanza (The National - Nov.10, 2012)      The Nabati Poetry of the UAE: a remarkable anthology (The National - March 9, 2012)                                  Marilyn Booth            Marilyn Booth, as a Senior Research Fellow at NYUAD, joined in September 2014, she will be writing a book on early Egyptian/Arab feminism and on women\u2019s contributions to the nahda in the final twenty years of the nineteenth century. The book will focus on the writer Zaynab Fawwaz (c1850-1914), who immigrated from Ottoman Lebanon to Egypt and wrote articles in the press, two novels, and a play. She\u2019s perhaps best known for her massive biographical dictionary of world women, al-Durr al-manthur fi tabaqat rabbat al-khudur (1893-6). Marilyn just wrote a book about that book (Classes of Ladies of Cloistered Lives: Writing Feminist History through Biography in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Egypt, Edinburgh University Press, January 2015). Fascinating, complicated and distinct from most of the early Arab women writers, Fawwaz merits further attention.     For the past five years she holds the Iraq Chair in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Before that, she taught in the Comparative Literature department at the University of Illinois, USA, as well as Brown University (USA) and the American University in Cairo (Egypt). Her year at New York University Abu Dhabi marks another transition: at the end of her fellowship she will be moving to Oxford (UK) as the Khalid b. Abdallah Al Saud Professor of the Study of the Contemporary Arab World, at the Oriental Institute and Magdalen College, University of Oxford. For her, this is also a return, since she wrote her DPhil dissertation at Oxford (St Antony\u2019s College) and was the Joanna McIver Junior Research Fellow there (St Hugh\u2019s College) before moving to Cairo for a job with Project HOPE.     Her areas of interest span gender studies, Arabic literature, auto/biography studies, translation studies and the practice of literary translation, vernacular culture and dialect literatures, and cultural history especially in the context of imperialised societies.  Her previous single-authored books concern Egyptian dialect poetry and popular prose, and intersections of biography, gender debates and feminism. She also translated a dozen or so novels and short story collections from the Arabic. Whilst remaining focused on the Arab region she is increasingly keen to explore linkages historically between Arab societies and those of south Asia, and to think broadly about circulations of texts \u2013 through translation, travel literature, newspaper \u2018borrowings\u2019, and the like \u2013 across subcontinental \u2018divides\u2019. She feels that Abu Dhabi is a perfect site from which to begin exploring.                               Matthew MacLean            Matthew MacLean joined NYUAD in September 2014 as a Research Assistant in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. He will be spending his fourth year in the Joint Program in History and Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at NYUAD. His dissertation research is on the spatial transformation of the Trucial States and United Arab Emirates in the second half of the twentieth century, in particular how the development of the UAE's infrastructure (particularly housing, roads, and ports) made possible the emergence of Emirati national identity. He pays special attention to the emergence of the UAE state and aim to place Emirati history in its wider regional and global contexts. He was a Fulbright student in the UAE in 2006-07 at Zayed University in Dubai while completing his MA thesis on US foreign policy in the Gulf in the 1970s. One of his favorite activities is exploring the rural areas of the UAE, especially in Ras al-Khaimah and Fujairah. Prior to entering graduate school, he taught history at the high school level in Brooklyn, NY for eight years.

Subsequent to her tenure with the NYU Abu Dhabi Research Institute, Anna received an NYU Humanities Initiative Graduate Fellowship to complete her dissertation writing in residence at NYUNY during the 2014-15 academic year.     Anna\u2019s research focuses on the sonic cultures and philosophies of the western Mediterranean, North Africa and the Arab Gulf. Her scholarship combines history, ethnography, theology and queer feminism at the intersection of music and sound studies. In her work, she strives to recognize suffering and courage as fundamental components of human being, and to assert their recognition as crucial to the Humanities endeavor.   The locus of her work is sawt \u2014 an Arabic concept that fuses all forms of acoustical resonance with voice, presence and soundness of being. She is particularly interested in how sawt is deployed within heterodox forms of spiritual practice, and in how sound and human integrity are entangled, neurologically and environmentally, in material bodies that are simultaneously personal and collective.   Her dissertation, \u201c\u1e62awt \u1e6canjah: A Historical Ethnography of Ethics, Acoustics and Civic Life in Modern Tangier,\u201d is an experiment in historical writing that examines sawt through a study of bare life, sonorous matter and technologies of the soul in Tangier, Morocco.     Upon completion of the Ph.D., Anna intends to undertake a long-term study of music, power, gender and sea-lust in the sovereign court of sixteenth-century North African pirate queen Sayyida al-Hurra. To support auxiliary interests in Maghrebi psych rock, urban art musics of the pre-oil Gulf, and early gramophone cultures of the Islamic world more generally, she collects old 45s and 78s produced in the region. Anna was trained as a pianist in the Western classical tradition, holds a B.F.A. in Music History and earned an M.A. in Social Anthropology from Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Northern Ireland.                                 Giuliano Garavini            Giuliano Garavini (Ph.D. University of Florence, 2006) is a FIRB lecturer (Italian Fund for Investment in Basic Research) in the Department of Political Science, Law and International Studies at the University of Padua. He is coordinating the Padua unit of the FIRB &quot;Engines of Growth: for a History of the Conflict Between Fossil and Renewable Energy Sources (1972-1992).&quot;     Giuliano Garavini has published numerous articles on the themes of European integration and of the energy crisis of the 1970s.     His last book is After Empires: European Integration, Decolonization and the Challenge from the Global South, 1957-1986 (OUP, 2012).     Research   The history of oil has mainly been written by historians and journalists from the perspective of oil consumers and multinational oil corporations. The best example of this trend is Daniel Yergin's standard history of oil: The Prize .   Giuliano Garavini is looking at the history of oil through the perspective of oil producing countries with the aim of writing a history of OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) from its origins to the present times. He has conducted research in Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria, in Vienna and is now collecting material and interviews in the Gulf region (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran).                                 Reynolds Richter            Reynolds Richter is a Ph.D. candidate in History at New York University who specializes in modern African history and colonial legal history. His work contributes to ongoing debates about land, ethnicity, and citizenship in Africa by showing how possibilities for unifying Kenya\u2019s plural legal system \u2014 comprised of \u201ccustomary,\u201d Islamic, and English law jurisdictions \u2014 opened and closed during the era of decolonization and independence.   His dissertation, \u201cLaw, Decolonization, and the Re-Making of Property in Coastal Kenya, 1945-1981,\u201d explores how the Kenyan state\u2019s efforts to replace the plurality of forms of land ownership with a single model based on English law created an institutional environment in which, paradoxically, land claims based on social status and local history could thrive. The project analyzes records of land disputes in the coastal hinterland to reveal how the region\u2019s local courts became sites for the continual re-negotiation of generational authority, local belonging, and gendered property relations.     Before coming to NYU, Richter received an M.A. in African Studies from Yale University and a B.A. in International Studies and Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In addition to the NYU Abu Dhabi Humanities Research Fellowship, his research has been funded by the Fulbright-Hayes Doctoral Dissertation Research Award, the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship, and a Mellon Dissertation Fellowship in the Humanities at New York University. His future plans include completing his first book manuscript and embarking on a new project that explores the legal culture of risk in postcolonial East Africa.

NYUAD Institute has embarked on a multi-year research fellowship program in the Humanities. This program aims to help create an energetic, multi-faceted research environment for the Humanities at NYUAD's campus. To this end, NYUAD is annually inviting applications from distinguished senior scholars as well as from promising junior scholars for residential fellowships at NYUAD\u2019s Institute. Fellows are contributing to NYUAD's intellectual community through research and research-related activities, including sharing their work-in-progress with NYUAD faculty and students and participating in scholarly networks engaged in ongoing research centered at the NYUAD Institute.     While open to scholars working in all areas of the Humanities, the program aims in particular to build a center of outstanding research capacity in areas of the Humanities that are relevant for the study of the Arabic world, its rich intellectual, religious, and scientific history, its cultural and artistic heritage as expressed in traditional and new media, and its interaction with other cultures in the past and present. Scholars of Arabic culture and history will find it enriching to work alongside fellows who conduct research in related and adjacent fields. Scholarship furthered by this program is closely connected to the research profile of NYUAD's faculty in the Arts &amp; Humanities; its Liberal Arts curriculum, with concentrations on History, Literature, Philosophy, the Arab Crossroads program, and Museum Studies; related departments and research centers at NYU New York; and NYUAD's outreach program in the UAE.                               Awards &amp; Facilities   The Institute is hosting up to two senior fellows and up to four junior fellows.         For the period of their fellowships, scholars are offered work/office space at the Institute, full use of NYUAD's library facilities (which are substantial, closely connected as they are to NYU's Main Library in New York), administrative support, housing at NYUAD's campus on Saadiyat Island, a fellowship stipend commensurate with experience, a personal research allowance, support for travel to and from Abu Dhabi. Fellowship recipients are responsible for conforming to tax requirements of their home countries.                               Start Date &amp; Duration   September 1, 2015 or February 1, 2016        Scholars may apply for one- or two-semester fellowships                             Candidate Qualifications   Eligible candidates for the senior fellowships have an outstanding scholarly accomplishment, including an internationally recognized publication record. Mid-career scholars with strong publication records and exceptional scholarly promise may be considered in this category. Eligible candidates for the junior fellowships, which are intended especially for young scholars who wish to turn their doctoral dissertations into book manuscripts publishable with major academic presses, have received their Ph.D. within the previous five years and have a strong record of scholarly accomplishment.   All research fellowships will be offered to scholars who demonstrate interest in playing an active role in the intellectual community of NYUAD, in particular by exchanging ideas with other Institute fellows and with NYU faculty and students. The fellowships are open to scholars of all backgrounds and nationalities.

Andrew Bush joined NYUAD in September 2014 as a Research Fellow in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. He has conducted ethnographic research with Iraqi Kurds for more than 10 years in the United States and the Kurdistan region of Iraq, spanning topics such as religion, literature, gender and kinship, nationalism, and violence. His abiding interest lies in how textual fragments from religious discourses are received and reworked in the intimate relationships that make up everyday life. His dissertation research focused on the everyday ethics of Muslims in Kurdistan who turn away from pietistic aspirations while at the same time citing Sufi poetry and sustaining intimate relations with more pious Muslims. Building on that work, he is drafting a book manuscript, tentatively titled A Threadbare Prayer Mat: Sufi Poetry and the Texture of Everyday life in Kurdistan, that provides an ethnographic account of poetry\u2019s appearance in ordinary life. The manuscript is itself an experiment in rendering the texture of life in prose that is interspersed with poetry. Engaging theories of religion, ethics, and desire, he argues that everyday life in Kurdistan engenders and sustains a broad range of paradoxes that are not yet acknowledged in studies of religious life.     His interest in the deeper history of poetry\u2019s fragmentation and recontextualization in Kurdistan led him to the epistolary letters (saturated with classical Persian poetry) of Mawlana Khalid Naqshbandi, an early 19th century revivalist figure who inspired a renaissance of Sorani Kurdish poetry. While at NYU Abu Dhabi, he will broaden this historical perspective by examining two further archives that open windows onto the lives of ordinary Muslims in Kurdistan who turn away from pietism. One is the transformation of non-Muslim figures of thought in Sorani Kurdish poetry over the past two centuries. Tracing figures such as Jesus, the Christian boy, the Zoroastrian priest, and the Jewish maiden, he asks how the attraction of their heretical potential changed as new religious discourses emerged in Kurdistan. The second archive was formed around the \u2018jihadi\u2019 Islamist movements that developed in Kurdistan in the second half of the twentieth century. Here he focuses on sermons\u2014poetic texts punctuated with poetry\u2014recorded during a peak of Islamists\u2019 armed struggle in Kurdistan in the 1990\u2019s. Analyzing such discourse in the context of larger processes of secularization and the violence of the Ba\u2019athist regime, he also examines the forms of skepticism and disappointment that discourse engendered among many ordinary Muslims in Kurdistan.   In addition to ethnographic surveys of the Middle East and approaches to critical Muslim intellectual traditions, he has taught courses on Western receptions of Islamicate literature, and on marriage and masculinity in Muslim societies. Inspired by new ethnographic research he conducted in 2014 on marriage and divorce proceedings in Kurdistan, he looks forward to developing courses on the mutual absorptions of everyday life and shari\u2019a, or Islamic \u2018law.\u2019                                Dale Stahl            Dale joined NYUAD in September 2014, as a Research Fellow in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. His scholarly interests center on the history of the Middle East during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Broadly, he is interested in how changes in the environment resulting from both human and non-human action relate to social and political change. His current research deals with water and hydraulic engineering in the Tigris-Euphrates basin during the early and middle part of the twentieth century. The human handling and exploitation of Mesopotamia\u2019s water has had a profound impact on the formation of political communities in the rivers\u2019 basin for millennia, but the period of modern development has received very little attention from historians. In his dissertation, he examined the action of both nature (in the form of floods and droughts) and human hydraulic management to explain how the environment figured into the shift from empire to nation-state and the diverse processes of modern state formation in Iraq, Syria and Turkey. His work has been heavily influenced by research in various fields of social science especially geography. After his fellowship year at NYUAD, he will join the history faculty at the University of Colorado Denver as an Assistant Professor of International Studies.                                 Marcel Kurpershoek            Marcel Kurpershoek will be joining NYUAD in January 2015 as Senior Research Fellow in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. His research subject is Nabati poetry, a traditional art in the Gulf and the Arabian peninsula. Its roots go back to the pre-Islamic classical Arabic poetry of famous bards like Imru \u2018l Qays. His fieldwork started in 1989 in central-Arabia, at the edge of the Empty Quarter, where he found illiterate poets who were great masters of this poetry\u2019s more recent Nabati version, with vernacular elements. These poems he recorded and published with a translation, introductions, and glossaries in five volumes, Oral Poetry &amp; Narratives from Central Arabia (Brill Publishers). He wrote about his fieldwork in Dutch books that were translated into English (Arabia of the Bedouins) and Arabic (al-Badawi al-Akhir, The Last Bedouin both Saqi Books). In Abu Dhabi he will study the links between Nabati poetry in inner Arabia (Najd) and the Gulf litoral. In addition, he will work on tv competitions like the Million\u2019s Poet. He has participated in workshops at NYUAD and contributed some articles on the subject in The National newspaper of Abu Dhabi. He has worked as a Dutch diplomat in Egypt (where he did his PhD on modern Egyptian literature), Syria, Saudi-Arabia, and as Netherlands ambassador in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Turkey, Poland and currently as Dutch special representative for Syria based in Istanbul.     Articles       Ancient Bedouin verse, the \u2018people\u2019s poetry\u2019, has found a new audience (The National - Nov. 7, 2013)       Poetry TV programmes a sign of a new Arab world? (The National - June 27, 2013)      Using poetry to take a stanza (The National - Nov.10, 2012)      The Nabati Poetry of the UAE: a remarkable anthology (The National - March 9, 2012)                                  Marilyn Booth            Marilyn Booth, as a Senior Research Fellow at NYUAD, joined in September 2014, she will be writing a book on early Egyptian/Arab feminism and on women\u2019s contributions to the nahda in the final twenty years of the nineteenth century. The book will focus on the writer Zaynab Fawwaz (c1850-1914), who immigrated from Ottoman Lebanon to Egypt and wrote articles in the press, two novels, and a play. She\u2019s perhaps best known for her massive biographical dictionary of world women, al-Durr al-manthur fi tabaqat rabbat al-khudur (1893-6). Marilyn just wrote a book about that book (Classes of Ladies of Cloistered Lives: Writing Feminist History through Biography in fin-de-si\u00e8cle Egypt, Edinburgh University Press, January 2015). Fascinating, complicated and distinct from most of the early Arab women writers, Fawwaz merits further attention.     For the past five years she holds the Iraq Chair in Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Before that, she taught in the Comparative Literature department at the University of Illinois, USA, as well as Brown University (USA) and the American University in Cairo (Egypt). Her year at New York University Abu Dhabi marks another transition: at the end of her fellowship she will be moving to Oxford (UK) as the Khalid b. Abdallah Al Saud Professor of the Study of the Contemporary Arab World, at the Oriental Institute and Magdalen College, University of Oxford. For her, this is also a return, since she wrote her DPhil dissertation at Oxford (St Antony\u2019s College) and was the Joanna McIver Junior Research Fellow there (St Hugh\u2019s College) before moving to Cairo for a job with Project HOPE.     Her areas of interest span gender studies, Arabic literature, auto/biography studies, translation studies and the practice of literary translation, vernacular culture and dialect literatures, and cultural history especially in the context of imperialised societies.  Her previous single-authored books concern Egyptian dialect poetry and popular prose, and intersections of biography, gender debates and feminism. She also translated a dozen or so novels and short story collections from the Arabic. Whilst remaining focused on the Arab region she is increasingly keen to explore linkages historically between Arab societies and those of south Asia, and to think broadly about circulations of texts \u2013 through translation, travel literature, newspaper \u2018borrowings\u2019, and the like \u2013 across subcontinental \u2018divides\u2019. She feels that Abu Dhabi is a perfect site from which to begin exploring.                               Matthew MacLean            Matthew MacLean joined NYUAD in September 2014 as a Research Assistant in the Humanities Research Fellowship Program. He will be spending his fourth year in the Joint Program in History and Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies at NYUAD. His dissertation research is on the spatial transformation of the Trucial States and United Arab Emirates in the second half of the twentieth century, in particular how the development of the UAE's infrastructure (particularly housing, roads, and ports) made possible the emergence of Emirati national identity. He pays special attention to the emergence of the UAE state and aim to place Emirati history in its wider regional and global contexts. He was a Fulbright student in the UAE in 2006-07 at Zayed University in Dubai while completing his MA thesis on US foreign policy in the Gulf in the 1970s. One of his favorite activities is exploring the rural areas of the UAE, especially in Ras al-Khaimah and Fujairah. Prior to entering graduate school, he taught history at the high school level in Brooklyn, NY for eight years.

Subsequent to her tenure with the NYU Abu Dhabi Research Institute, Anna received an NYU Humanities Initiative Graduate Fellowship to complete her dissertation writing in residence at NYUNY during the 2014-15 academic year.     Anna\u2019s research focuses on the sonic cultures and philosophies of the western Mediterranean, North Africa and the Arab Gulf. Her scholarship combines history, ethnography, theology and queer feminism at the intersection of music and sound studies. In her work, she strives to recognize suffering and courage as fundamental components of human being, and to assert their recognition as crucial to the Humanities endeavor.   The locus of her work is sawt \u2014 an Arabic concept that fuses all forms of acoustical resonance with voice, presence and soundness of being. She is particularly interested in how sawt is deployed within heterodox forms of spiritual practice, and in how sound and human integrity are entangled, neurologically and environmentally, in material bodies that are simultaneously personal and collective.   Her dissertation, \u201c\u1e62awt \u1e6canjah: A Historical Ethnography of Ethics, Acoustics and Civic Life in Modern Tangier,\u201d is an experiment in historical writing that examines sawt through a study of bare life, sonorous matter and technologies of the soul in Tangier, Morocco.     Upon completion of the Ph.D., Anna intends to undertake a long-term study of music, power, gender and sea-lust in the sovereign court of sixteenth-century North African pirate queen Sayyida al-Hurra. To support auxiliary interests in Maghrebi psych rock, urban art musics of the pre-oil Gulf, and early gramophone cultures of the Islamic world more generally, she collects old 45s and 78s produced in the region. Anna was trained as a pianist in the Western classical tradition, holds a B.F.A. in Music History and earned an M.A. in Social Anthropology from Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Northern Ireland.                                 Giuliano Garavini            Giuliano Garavini (Ph.D. University of Florence, 2006) is a FIRB lecturer (Italian Fund for Investment in Basic Research) in the Department of Political Science, Law and International Studies at the University of Padua. He is coordinating the Padua unit of the FIRB &quot;Engines of Growth: for a History of the Conflict Between Fossil and Renewable Energy Sources (1972-1992).&quot;     Giuliano Garavini has published numerous articles on the themes of European integration and of the energy crisis of the 1970s.     His last book is After Empires: European Integration, Decolonization and the Challenge from the Global South, 1957-1986 (OUP, 2012).     Research   The history of oil has mainly been written by historians and journalists from the perspective of oil consumers and multinational oil corporations. The best example of this trend is Daniel Yergin's standard history of oil: The Prize .   Giuliano Garavini is looking at the history of oil through the perspective of oil producing countries with the aim of writing a history of OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) from its origins to the present times. He has conducted research in Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria, in Vienna and is now collecting material and interviews in the Gulf region (UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iran).                                 Reynolds Richter            Reynolds Richter is a Ph.D. candidate in History at New York University who specializes in modern African history and colonial legal history. His work contributes to ongoing debates about land, ethnicity, and citizenship in Africa by showing how possibilities for unifying Kenya\u2019s plural legal system \u2014 comprised of \u201ccustomary,\u201d Islamic, and English law jurisdictions \u2014 opened and closed during the era of decolonization and independence.   His dissertation, \u201cLaw, Decolonization, and the Re-Making of Property in Coastal Kenya, 1945-1981,\u201d explores how the Kenyan state\u2019s efforts to replace the plurality of forms of land ownership with a single model based on English law created an institutional environment in which, paradoxically, land claims based on social status and local history could thrive. The project analyzes records of land disputes in the coastal hinterland to reveal how the region\u2019s local courts became sites for the continual re-negotiation of generational authority, local belonging, and gendered property relations.     Before coming to NYU, Richter received an M.A. in African Studies from Yale University and a B.A. in International Studies and Political Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In addition to the NYU Abu Dhabi Humanities Research Fellowship, his research has been funded by the Fulbright-Hayes Doctoral Dissertation Research Award, the Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship, and a Mellon Dissertation Fellowship in the Humanities at New York University. His future plans include completing his first book manuscript and embarking on a new project that explores the legal culture of risk in postcolonial East Africa.

The approach taken selects key ethnographies and uses them to explore questions of methodological, theoretical, and substantive nature. This course is designed to introduce students to anthropological investigation and to facilitate understanding of how the discipline engages with and represents the everyday realities, challenges, and concerns of the people with whom anthropologists work.

Beginning with early Western travelers&rsquo; imaginaries of Arabia and ending with a reflection on the role of anthropology in the Arab world (and more globally) today, this course provides an introduction to the anthropological project and to the everyday realities of people living in the region.

This course examines the recent history of the region from the mid-18th century until the Arab uprisings of 2010&ndash;2012. We explore the last Islamic empires, the intrusion of European colonial powers, the modernist, nationalist and Islamic reactions to aggression, the creation of authoritarian systems of power and the multiform protests that have shaken them. The Egyptian, Iranian, Palestinian, and Saudi experiences are examined more closely.

Muslims subsequently developed and expressed their faith in the disciplines of law, theology, and mysticism, even as their religious communities fractured into a variety of Sunni and Shi&rsquo;a groups. This course focuses on primary sources to examine the richness of Islamicate civilization in the pre-modern world, including inter-religious relations as well as political and economic trends.

Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. In this course we investigate the rich and complex history of al-Andalus, focusing on the changing relationships between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish communities.

We learn about Arab seafaring and trade in the Indian Ocean and the creation of the &quot;Arabian Seas.&quot; We read the narratives of Arab merchants, such as Suleiman the Merchant and Abu Hassan al-Sirafi who came to China from the Gulf in the 9th and the 10th centuries, and the great travelogue by Abu Abdallah Ibn Battuta, who traveled to China all the way from North Africa in the 14th century. We study the history of the corresponding periods in Chinese history&mdash;the Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties, and to complement the Arab travelogues, read the narrative of Ma Huan, the Chinese Muslim who sailed from China to Mecca and other cities in the region in the 15th century. The class visits Quanzhou, better known as Zaytoon, a city dominated by Arabs for several centuries, and other port cities in the Yangzi Delta and north in the Grand Canal on the way to Beijing.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ACS-AD 206X Jews in the Muslim World in the Middle Ages                                                                              This course examines the history and culture of the Jews in the medieval Islamic world, beginning with the historiographical debate about this contentious subject. The syllabus moves from the early encounter between Islam and the Jews at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, discussing the Qur&rsquo;an and other foundational texts, to the legal and actual status of the Jews. We will examine how the famous Cairo Geniza documents illuminate Jewish (and Islamic) life, and how changes in the economy affected developments in Jewish law. The course will also examine the organization and functions of the Jewish community and will address the large question of how much autonomy the Jews actually had. We will also read literary sources showing how deeply influenced the Jews were by Arabic culture. Where relevant, comparisons will be drawn with the situation of the Christian minority in the Islamic world and with that of Jews living in Medieval Latin Europe.

Throughout, we will be focusing on gender, class, ethnic, and religious cleavages. Part I will cover late nineteenth-century religious practices as well as social and gender relations. Part II will explore the role of imperialist powers during the Constitutional Revolution and subsequent politics of oil in the Pahlavi period. Part III will turn to the social, cultural, and economic reasons for the emergence of Islamism. Here we concentrate on the links between Islamist and Leftist intellectual discourses during the 1970s, Khomeini&rsquo;s appropriation of these discourses during the Islamic Revolution, and the Islamist state&rsquo;s consolidation of power during the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Part IV will focus on the process whereby, during the 1990s, many leftist Islamists gravitated towards a human rights discourse and declared themselves Muslim Reformists. Here we will give special attention to debates over democratization and human rights, gender/sexuality, and religious/ethnic diversity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Its aim is to present various aspects of Saudi society and politics, from tribes and tribalism to oil, state building, Islamic activism and women. Saudi history has shifted since the 18th century, when a remote polity was confronting the Ottoman Empire and powerful Bedouin tribes. Since the creation of the modern state in 1932 and the discovery of oil in 1937, the country has become an essential albeit poorly understood player on the international scene.

Beginning with the wave of independence and anti-colonial movements in the region, this course will analyze wars and political violence as mediated moments that rely on communicative acts and technologies. Simultaneously, the course will analyze how various media technologies &ndash; including radio, film, satellite TV, and internet &ndash; are formed through moments of war, conflict, and violence.

Attention will be paid to both the construction of the male and female sexes in relation to the notion of the modern, as well as the issue of modern desires and sexual identities, in an attempt to recast the relation between the Arab world and sex from a broader perspective, including imperial and colonial relations. The focus on specific case studies will allow us to reflect critically on Eurocentric theories of gender and sexuality. Major themes under exploration will comprise the question of the veil, the structure of the family, the use of sexual pleasures, the debates around female genital cutting, the conflicts over reproduction, and the politics of sexual identity. Writers include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Ann Laura Stoler, Lisa Pollard, Joseph Massad, Leila Abu-Lughod, Chandra Mohanty, Mehammed Mack, Beatriz Preciado, Joan Wallach Scott, Saba Mahmood, Farha Ghannam, Homa Hoodfar, Afsaneh Najmabadi, Ayan Hirsi Ali, Marcia Inhorn, Madawi al Rasheed, Douglas Northrop, Silvia Federici, and Goran Therborn.    *Note: Former title of this course was &#39;Arabs, Sex, and Modernity&#39;.

ACS-AD 235X Contentious Politics in the Arab World                                             The Arab region currently lives through an intense period of repression. Surveillance and control engulf the daily lives of millions of citizens; political activists are silenced, jailed, tortured, sometimes executed; wars are waged against unruly political movements, regions, even entire countries. This unprecedented level of repression shows the resilience of authoritarianism. It also shows, paradoxically, the vitality and efficiency of political movements in the Arab World. How do citizens organize under surveillance and repression? What resources do they draw on, what strategies do they adopt to propose alternative political projects? Students will study contentious politics in the region since 1945, from Arab nationalism to socialism, unionism, communism, and Islamism. They will explore the making of contention in the various sites where organized action crystallized, from fields, factories, and oilrigs to streets, universities, and mosques. They will analyze the 2011 uprisings and their aftermaths, including the latest episodes of repression and militarization.

The novels are our guides in order to understand the multiple layers of a city, and to build knowledge about the relationship between literature and social life. We read works by Naguib Mahfouz, Sunalla Ibrahim, Huda Barakat, Hanan Al Sheikh, Tawfic Yussuf Awad, Sinan Antoun, and Ghassan Kanafani. We read the novels as both individual and collective experiences, and we discuss how the new literary genre reflected and participated in the process of social change.

Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We begin with the strengths and weaknesses of area studies, and the politics of producing knowledge on a region of global economic and political importance, then turn to specific areas of research that have attracted attention in the fields of history, anthropology, literature, and politics, before exploring the various methodological approaches used by practitioners of these fields.

AHC-AD 114 Translation as Multimedia Practice and Metaphor                                             This course concerns the aesthetics and politics of translation, both as a historically and culturally situated practice and as a rich metaphor for cultural production, cross-cultural encounter, and other types of creation, appropriation, and change. The course emphasizes transformations that occur in cross-media translations, such as when poems are set to music and books are turned into films. In addition to writing a number of short, critical essays on translations broadly conceived, studies create literary and/or cross-media translations of their own. Students perform their translations at the end of the semester.

It traces the history of the various protest movements and the plethora of national experiences with respect to domestic and transnational networks of dissent as well as global imaginaries. Taking into account the aesthetics and performativity of protest, the course examines the role of cultural practices, action repertoires, the media, visual representations, lifestyle and fashion, the politics of memory, and the impact of dissent on political decision-makers and society at large. Course materials draw on the most recent historiography, as well as literature, film, art, music, and oral history.

AHC-AD 126 Age of Warhol                                             At the global art market&#39;s most recent peak in 2007, American Pop artist Andy Warhol (1928-1987) edged out Pablo Picasso to become the world&#39;s highest earning painter at auction. Although he has recently ceded that position to Chinese artists Zhang Daqian (1899-1983) and Qi Baishi (1864-1957), Warhol remains one of the most influential forces in contemporary art worldwide. From his famous Campbell&#39;s soup cans to his enduring aphorism that &quot;In the future, everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes,&quot; Warhol&#39;s art and thinking saturate contemporary culture. This seminar uses his diaries and other writing as a base-line against which we will examine his 25-year career as a painter, filmmaker, publisher and music producer, TV personality, and artistic mentor and collaborator, as well as his legacy in what has been described as our &quot;Warhol economy.&quot; What can Warhol&#39;s output and reception tell us about class, gender and sexuality, religion, and media over the last half century? And how should we understand his role in the making of global culture today?

This global examination of children will discuss common themes and cultural variations. We will consider child labor, children in cities, children and war, and the changing historical nature of the family in America, Europe, and China. We discuss education and health in global perspective, looking at children in the urban world of the 21st century, with field trips to the Shanghai Children&rsquo;s Palace, the Shanghai Children&rsquo;s Hospital, a school, an orphanage. Each student will report to the class on some particular theme of childhood in comparative cultural perspective.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

AHC-AD 129J Memory and the City: Berlin in 20th Century History and Literature                                                        One may well call European and especially German history in the 20th century eventful. As the German capital, Berlin saw the transition of the German Empire to a functioning if turbulent democratic state in 1918. The rise of the Nazis to power and their defeat in WW II led to the notorious division of the city which then belonged to two states. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, German reunification was imminent. The course will engage with Berlin as a city of memory as represented in places and reflected in literature. Visits include: Checkpoint Charlie; the Berlin Wall; the Reichstag; the Olympic stadium and village; the Bauhaus Archive and Museum; and the Gem&auml;ldegalerie.

AHC-AD 130J Miracle of Florence                                             In the 15th and 16th centuries, the city of Florence was a center of immense creativity in every area of human understanding and endeavor. It was the center of that extraordinary moment we call \"the Renaissance\"&mdash;the revolution in art, architecture, politics, philosophy and science that has shaped our view of the world, and the place of human beings in it. In this seminar, we read representative writings from several of the great Florentine thinkers of the period&mdash;Alberti, Machiavelli, Pico, and Galileo. Our goal is twofold: to discover what was original in each, and to grasp how all were connected by a shared set of ideals and beliefs. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to the main cultural monuments of Florence, where we see (among other wonders) the palaces and churches that Alberti designed, the telescope through which Galileo spied the moons of Jupiter, and the tomb where Machiavelli lies.

AHC-AD 131J The Enlightenment and Its Institutions                                             With astonishing speed&mdash;mere decades in the middle of the eighteenth century&mdash;Enlightenment not only transformed how we think about ourselves, through new concepts of individuality and community, liberty and verifiable truth, it also remade Britain&rsquo;s cities and institutions. Imagine London without the British Museum (1759) or the Royal Academy (1768). Imagine our curriculum without Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary (1755) or the Encyclopedia Britannica (1768). 250 years later, we will use the resources of the Global Network University to recover how this revolution in methods, tools, and institutions recast inquiry and enterprise in the West and to consider what we might do with our Enlightenment inheritance now. Behind-the-scenes adventures into London&rsquo;s museums, galleries, and civic societies allow us to add our own tracks to the intellectual map we draw in class.

AHC-AD 132J Prague, Capital of Europe                                             Prague should have been destroyed during the Second World War, like other major cities in Europe, but somehow it wasn't. The remarkable survival of this exquisite city allows us to explore Central European history and culture in the context of a completely preserved inner urban core dating back to the Middle Ages. Drawing upon primary source readings, cartography, musical performances, art and architecture, the course illuminates the way crosscurrents of European culture became focused in Prague between 1400 and the present. In addition to academic encounters with such figures as Mucha, Kafka, Mozart, and Kundera, the course includes walking tours around Prague, trips to museums and concerts, excursions outside the city, and interactions with leading local performers and thinkers.

AHC-AD 133J Idea of the Renaissance in Modern Thought                                             Ever since the late seventeenth century, thinkers calling themselves \"modern\" have sought to establish a sense of their relationship to ancient history and thought. Florence has played a major role in these efforts and in the very idea of what modernity is. First, because Florence has remained intimately associated with the Renaissance, and thus with a literary, aesthetic, and scientific return to the Ancients. And second, because it is seen as a birthplace of modern political thought&mdash;especially republicanism and the theory of the state. In this class we will study the place of Florence in the modern imagination. We follow in the footsteps, both textual and actual, of thinkers who looked back to the past, and even at themselves, through the Florentine lens, and who asked what it means to be modern, to look to &ldquo;the ancients,&rdquo; and to look at the Renaissance as a cultural rebirth, by way of the city and its cultural heroes.

We will listen to a range of women&rsquo;s voices: novelists and poets, including Emily Dickinson, Adrienne Rich, Virginia Woolf, Toni Morrison, and Arundhati Roy; film-makers, including Shawn Slovo (&ldquo;A World Apart&rdquo;) and Haifaa al-Mansour (&ldquo;Wadjda&rdquo;); and scholars, including Martha Nussbaum (The Fragility of Goodness) and Leila Ahmed (Border Passage). Students will be asked to consider how these readings illuminate the human condition or throw light on aspects of human experience that challenge traditional assumptions, including assumptions about women and men.

AHC-AD 135 Reading the Earth: World Literature and the Environment                                                                   This course introduces students to several genres of literature&mdash;drama, the novel, poetry, and the short story&mdash;and to some fundamental categories of literary criticism including Marxism, feminism, post-colonial theory, and eco-criticism. We will be examining conceptions of nature and how &ldquo;the natural&rdquo; is represented in texts, especially after the explosive growth of industrialization in Victorian England and its subsequent global diffusion. Each unit of the course is constructed around a particular problem that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. In an attempt to address a representative range of eco-critical dilemmas, we will examine texts from around the world not only in terms of local and regional issues, but also with an eye towards a more global perspective. In attempting to conceptualize nature and the environment, it has become difficult not to think globally. Thinking about literature is increasingly becoming a parallel kind of exercise and students will be encouraged to explore the connections between a global world of texts and the larger natural environment that both shapes and is, in turn, shaped by them.

Topics will include the contrast afforded by the West; originality and the Chinese copycat phenomenon; the autobiographical impulse; and hybridity. Exercises in cultural psychology and readings and lectures on art, architecture and literature will be supplemented by field trips to a variety of museums, such as the Shanghai Museum, the Shikumen Museum, the Rockbund Art Museum, the Chinese Imperial Examination System Museum, and the Propaganda Poster Art Museum, as well as to the Novartis research lab, where cross-cultural issues affecting scientific research are being addressed through architecture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

AHC-AD 137J Imagining the Renaissance City: Florence and Siena                                             Many institutions central to today&rsquo;s cities &ndash; banks, hospitals, civic governments, museums, communal systems of welfare and sustainability &ndash; had their testing grounds in the small Tuscan towns of medieval and Renaissance Italy. These towns also pioneered recognizably modern artistic, cultural, and engineering practices. Florence and Siena were especially vibrant in this transformation of urban life: the one a powerhouse of culture and industry, the other the Wall Street of Europe as it financed entrepreneurs, popes, and Europe&rsquo;s kings. Our project for our three weeks together is to figure out what made Florence and Siena tick. We&rsquo;ll come to know these cities intimately, visiting seats of government and Renaissance orphanages, climbing towers, exploring the home of a fifteenth-century merchant, and prowling a recently-excavated crypt under Siena&rsquo;s cathedral. We&rsquo;ll also read and study the utopian (and dystopian) visions of these cities &ndash; Lorenzetti&rsquo;s frescoes of Good Government and Dante&rsquo;s Inferno -- along with diaries, letters, and constitutions. And to help you hone your writing skills, we&rsquo;ll read the travelogues of two of Italy&rsquo;s greatest story-tellers: Marco Polo and Italo Calvino.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

We will explore a range of sites of representation and imagination &ndash; in the expressions of visual art, film, and the performativity of political activism &ndash; in studying how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms. While those in the dominant society thought at first that Aboriginal people and their culture would &ldquo;die out&rdquo; and later that they would or could be simply &ldquo;assimilated,&rdquo; we will trace a history of Indigenous people from urban and remote communities intervening on what W.E.H. Stanner called &ldquo;the great Australian silence&rdquo; and asserting their right to a cultural future. This will include assessing the contentious history of debates over the very rights of representation of Aboriginal culture and realities. This course will make use of several museums in Sydney, and a few prominent Indigenous scholars and artists will present their work relevant to the theme.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 1 the student will perfect their knowledge of the Arabic writing/reading system; will learn how to produce accurate and coherent sentences in Arabic; and will utilize a variety of audio-visual material to begin to re-discover, debate, and express some of the key characteristics of Arab culture and identity.

Building on the students&#39; prior knowledge of Modern Standard Arabic, this course introduces the students to the unique aspects that make the Emirati dialect so lively and distinctive. From the heart of the ancient oasis of Al Ain where the course is taught, the course also serves as a gateway to accessing intimate aspects of life, culture, and heritage of the Gulf region. Using a bilingual textbook specifically designed by the course instructors to teach Emirati Arabic in formal and informal settings, students learn and experience the target dialect through direct instruction as well as through exploration of Emirati cultural life in folklore, song, film, art, and literature.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

These courses are designed to help those students master formal Arabic language skills and empower them, as citizens, to become more engaged in their society, culture, and heritage. The series achieves this goal by reactivating the students&rsquo; acquired but dormant knowledge of their native tongue even as it provides new accessible and relevant instruction in the language. In ALH 2 the student will work to perfect their command of Arabic syntax; will learn to produce longer argumentative pieces; will begin to access, assess and taste some of Arabic&rsquo;s key modern literary and cultural products and will continue to debate, and explore various aspects of Arabic culture.

The course includes fourteen modules, twelve already set, and two final modules to be worked out over the semester by two student teams. The modules center on key texts in categories, like language, place, family, and customs, which inform and shape modern Arab identities, civilization(s), and consciousness.    Note: Any NYUAD Colloquial Arabic course will satisfy the Colloquial prerequisite requirement for this course.

Projects may range in form from a creative art project to a theoretical or historical research project. The program consists of a capstone seminar, taken in the first semester of the senior year, and a year-long individualized thesis tutorial. During the capstone seminar, students define the parameters of their projects and begin exploratory work and research. The capstone experience culminates in the public presentation of the project. Students may also elect to participate in a capstone project with other students majoring in the arts. Collaborating students work with a faculty member to define the overall goals of the group Capstone Project, as well as the goals of each participant.

What&rsquo;s the microbiome, and why should you care? How do we know about human migration patterns in ancient times, or the domestication of plants? What can our DNA tell us about heritable diseases? Fueled largely by the Human Genome Project, modern biological science has entered a new, revolutionary era in the 21st century. Genomics and Bioinformatics &ndash; the collection and analysis of vast amounts of sequence and functional data &ndash; are transforming the way we think, enabling us to solve long-standing mysteries and ask new kinds of questions. New scientific discoveries from genome sciences are impacting society, and our every day lives, on all levels: public policy, medicine, health, and the environment. Familiarity with these fields is thus vital for any educated citizen in our globally interconnected world. This course introduces students to fundamental concepts and hot topics in genome science through seminars, critical review of current research articles, student presentations, and interactive discussion. In Spring 2015, Genome Biology will be held as a joint course between New York and Abu Dhabi, enabling students to get to know their peers across the Global Network University.    *Note : (Spring 2015) will be co-taught with an instructor from New York (Manpreet, Katari).

The guiding principal in designing synthetic projects is often derived from a systems level understanding of cellular networks, with metabolic network analyses playing a key role in offering informed hypotheses on how to modify cellular wirings for a desired outcome. This course combines lectures, class discussions, and lab experiments (both wet and computational) to explore applications of advanced genomics and molecular biology tools to alter the metabolic circuits of E. coli . The course engages students in a guided research project to learn advanced molecular techniques, such as gene silencing through CRISPR/Cas or TALEN systems, and systems level analysis of metabolism through pathway and flux balance analysis using integrated computational tools such as PathwayTools. Students will become familiar with engineering concepts such as defining biological components as &ldquo;parts&rdquo; and cataloging them in synthetic biology parts registries. Students will also design novel genetic circuits, assemble new constructs and transform competent cells with in house cloned vectors. In addition, students will develop skills to formulate systems based hypotheses and write scientific research proposals.

This course begins with a thorough review of cells, with a special emphasis on eukaryotes and their different compartments. This is followed by an investigation of the structures and functions of biological macromolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates and lipids. Students gain a deep understanding of information flow in cells via detailed biophysical analysis of replication and gene expression. Ultimately, the principles of biophysics are applied to disease states with an eye toward rational design of therapeutics.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify areas of interest for their own capstone research and develop and write an in-depth research proposal over the course of the semester. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2015-16 all science majors are expected to take this course in their junior year.

Bats fly with great precision in total darkness. Honeybees find their way home using a path they have never seen before. Baby songbirds retain the memory of hearing their father&rsquo;s song for several months before they actually are able to sing that song themselves. All these animals rely on specific mechanisms in their brains to endow them with these remarkable abilities. Understanding these mechanisms can provide deep insights into how all brains, including our own, are shaped by evolution to be fantastic problem solving machines. In this course we will explore the unique worlds of several animals, highlighting first the specific environmental problems that a particular animal must solve, and second, the amazing ways the brains of these animals implement imaginative solutions to these problems. This course does not presume a strong background in biology, but two things help: an appreciation of the beauty of the animals around us and a genuine curiosity about how in the world they are able to do what they do.

In contrast to classical mechanics, which describes the interaction of energy and matter on large bodies, quantum mechanics focuses on the interactions of energy and matter at the atomic and subatomic level. Hence, this course provides detailed insight into modern approaches that explain the structure and spectra of atoms and molecules. After completion of this course, students are able to understand the origins and meanings of key chemical concepts, including wave functions, atomic and molecular orbitals, energy levels, hybridization, atomic and molecular spectra, and electron spin. They are also able to interpret various spectra&mdash; electronic, rotational, infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance&mdash;and to correlate these to the structures of atoms and molecules.

The course introduces the principles and practices of &ldquo;classical&rdquo; physicochemical methods in chemical thermodynamics and kinetics, and continues with modern experimental and computational methods that are widely used in contemporary analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry laboratories. The experiments include thermochemical techniques such as calorimetry to determine the heat exchange during chemical reactions or physical processes, construction and interpretation of phase diagrams of binary and ternary mixtures, measurement and prediction of kinetic rates of chemical reactions, determination of rate constants, characterization of colloids, and measuring the electrochemical properties of matter. The experiments will be supported by computer simulations, and are highly focused on the processes of experimentation, data recording, correct analysis, and meaningful interpretation of the observations. After completion of this course, the students will be able to approach a chemical problem, set up a hypothesis, perform accurate measurement, interpret the results, verify the hypothesis, draw conclusions, and communicate effectively the results orally and in writing.    * 2 credits    *Pre or co-requisites are CHEM-AD 103                                                                       Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Mazin Magzoub , Wael M.

Through the exposure to NYUAD faculty research students identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth chemistry capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year.

This course is designed especially for those beginners who have no previous background in Chinese but would like to learn the language more intensively and more quickly. Unlike the regular Elementary Chinese I course which will teach ten chapters during one semester, this course will cover twenty chapters during the semester. The training that students get will be equal to one academic year of training, and after completing this course, students will be eligible to skip Elementary Chinese II and take Intermediate Chinese I directly.    The course will begin with introducing Pinyin, the phonetic system of Mandarin Chinese. After that, it will introduce radicals, some basic vocabulary, sentence structures, and grammar points. By the end of the semester, students are expected to be able to read Chinese characters with correct tones; write characters in correct stroke order; compose short essays by using the vocabulary and grammar they have learned; understand by listening conversations about some easy topics; and handle certain informal topics that require an exchange of basic information related to study and leisure activities.

We begin by discussing the voice&rsquo;s relationship to the body (both in terms of anatomy and contemporary discourse  on &ldquo;embodiment&rdquo;) and to a number of technologies, from amplification to autotune. In the second half of the course, we focus in on the salience of voice  within the experimental music scene in New York. Perhaps most importantly, we treat our class as an experimental vocal collective, composing and performing together throughout the term. No prior musical experience is necessary, but a willingness to make vocal sounds in public is required.

COREA-AD 02J Idea of the Portrait                                             This course explores the ways in which the portrait has been used as a vehicle for artistic expression, for the construction of social identity, for self-examination, and for the representation of cultural difference. It examines many kinds of portraits and self-portraits in painting and photography from different times and cultures and encourages engagement with a range of major issues that include the nature of personhood, of private and public identities, and of art itself.

COREA-AD 02W Idea of the Portrait                                             The course explores the ways in which the portrait has been used as vehicle for artistic expression, for the construction of social identity, for self-examination, and for the representation of cultural difference. It examines many kinds of portraits and self-portraits in painting and photography from different times and cultures and encourages engagement with a range of major issues that include the nature of personhood, of private and public identities, and of art itself. The course draws upon the rich resources of London&#39;s museums and galleries, especially the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, and the Queen&#39;s Collection.    the portrait as a pivotal human artifact for artistic expression, private identity formation, and public self-fashioning. It traces a series of thematic issues central to the idea of the portrait through history in different cultures, media, and techniques. Themes to study are: image and likeness from antiquity to Facebook; the portrait as real and surrogate presence; portraiture and psychology; the &ldquo;face of power&rdquo;; portraits without a face; the work of art as self portrait; digital identity and the private portrait in the public domain; animal portraits and their owners; masks and casts; the unintended portrait; anthropomorphisms and readymades; the better self: face-lift and Photoshop; after life and afterlife.

COREA-AD 03 Instruments of World Cultures                                             Musical instruments have been created by humans for at least 35,000 years. How do diverse musical cultures view the significance of the sounds and playing techniques of musical instruments? From instrumental story-telling in Siberia, Central Asian shaman-bards, dervish flutes, folk, Gypsy and classical fiddling, dulcimers, psalteries and keyboards to drumming in several parts of the world, the course examines why musical cultures need instruments; how these instruments interact with or take the place of vocal music; where they are connected to dance and where they have evolved far from dance; how diverse cultures attribute positive or negative moral values to different instruments and their players; and how a single musical culture may feel the need to exchange, develop or exclude particular musical instruments over time.

COREA-AD 04J Gardens of Eden                                             The Garden of Eden haunts the history of the peoples of the Book&mdash;Jews, Christians, Muslims&mdash;as primal site of creation, bounty, betrayal, and loss, as spur to repentance and redemption, as preview of heaven and model of earthly Utopia. The exile of Adam and Eve from the garden that God planted for the first man and filled with all the Earth's creatures and plants set their descendants on an infinite quest to find, describe, and recreate it. The course studies the efforts by people of the Abrahamic religions to specify the site, form, and meaning of the first Garden, in theology, literature, visual art, film, and garden design. It seeks convergences and differences among these interpretations across millennia and media, and ask whether the Garden of Eden continues to hold productive meanings today. All students participate in a garden design project. This course includes field trips to gardens in Abu Dhabi and abroad.

Taught by a collaborative artist, the course looks at collaboration as it has emerged from the recent history of art, literature, and science to become an essential method of contemporary social experience. Course projects and materials are based around the use of the iPad. Working with the device on creative, co-authored projects, students gain first-hand experience in considering how collaboration is structured and managed in the production of creative works and how a consideration of collaborative and interactive methods changes the way we think about the nature of the finished creative project.

Spanning several millennia and many continents, our material challenges us to think about gender, family, biology, and faith as manifestations of an attempt to reconcile human needs and desires. We work with ancient texts like the Ramayana, the Upanishads, and the Song of Songs; the poetry of Kalidasa, Rumi, and Neruda; plays by Zeami, Euripides, Shakespeare, Lorca, Tennessee Williams, and Sarah Kane; the music of PJ Harvey, Antony &amp; The Johnsons, and Thom Yorke; the photography of Cindy Sherman; and the films of David Lynch. Students move towards creating their own inventions, employing creative writing, physical improvisations, ensemble performance, and photography.

COREA-AD 10 Scapegoat                                             The scapegoat, however unwillingly, has played a role in human culture since the earliest times. This course examines the phenomena of scapegoating from both a historical and psychological perspective, and examines its treatment in films, literature, music, and new technology. Tracing the origins of scapegoating as a tribal rite and as one of the defining aspects of Greek tragedy, this course ultimately poses the question&mdash;what is it, in the human psyche, that causes us to demonize and dehumanize the &ldquo;other,&rdquo; and demand, in the most extreme cases, witch trials throughout the centuries, mob lynchings, the Holocaust, and the more recent genocide in Rwanda. This course also touches on the technological forms of scapegoating such as cyber-bullying and examines how the Internet itself is often used as a scapegoating device.

Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. No computer programming experience is required; the course starts with the basics of code using the Processing environment.

How have these inventions, such as writing, printing, photography, the telegraph, television, radio, and the internet, influenced human behavior throughout the course of history? What role do they play in shaping our lives today? Toward the end of the course, students will speculate on the future of communication technologies in a connected world by prototyping their own inventions and experiences. Readings and discussion will cover communication theory, technical processes, and creative applications. Writing assignments will be paired with practical assignments where students will be challenged to bring their analysis and ideas to life. We will also utilize the world wide web as a test bed for experiencing and experimenting with various forms of communication both old and new, ranging anywhere from the printing press to the 3D printer and everything in between.

COREA-AD 20 Renaissance Orientations                                             Scholarly approaches to Renaissance art have traditionally focused on what it inherited from the Roman world. What happens to our understanding of the Renaissance when we highlight its relationship to Jerusalem, Constantinople, and other cultural centers in the Eastern Mediterranean? This course investigates the interpretive implications of this shift in orientation, exploring the West&rsquo;s fascination with objects and images produced by Byzantine and Islamic artists, and the complications of identity produced by pilgrimages to the east, both real and imaginary.

COREA-AD 21 Gesture in Speech, Poetry, Music, and Dance                                                        Gesture lies at the interface of the verbal and the non-verbal in human communication and expression. Through bodily movement, intonation, and stress gesture can transcend the distinctions between normal speech, poetry, song, and dance. Gaining a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of gesture in a variety of media across different cultures enables the student to approach fundamental means of human expression, and to learn to recognize constants in human communication within the myriad of culturally specific conventions of language, prosody, music, and dance.

COREA-AD 22 Inventions                                             Inventions have played a pivotal role in the development of history, mankind, and culture. Inventors articulate problems and find creative solutions, often by combining concepts that are not typically linked. This class examines inventions and the process of inventing through case studies. We consider the historical context of inventions and how the use of inventions can change from one culture to another. Some of the inventions we explore are the bow and arrow, the lever, the bicycle, dynamite, the fax machine, and the computer. Students are presented with problems and asked to create prototypes and invent new tools.

COREA-AD 23 Rhythm                                             Rhythm has been described as patterns of events in time and space, and is a prominent feature of life and learning. This interdisciplinary course examines what rhythm is and how it manifests itself in a wide variety of domains that range from music and the visual decorative arts traditions spanning cultures across the globe and throughout history, to how it emerges in, and is informed by, areas such as mathematics, computer science, music theory, music technology, biology, psychology, linguistics, sociology, evolution and human migrations, ethnology, crystallography, nuclear physics, calendar design, radio astronomy, architecture, computer graphics, and the visual arts. Students read from books and journal articles, solve problems, listen to music, drum with their hands on their desks, learn how to use computer software systems to analyze as well as generate rhythms, solve puzzles of musical time patterns, and write on a variety of topics. They complete an individual research project that showcases the application of knowledge in their selected discipline and culture to an open question concerned with rhythm.

COREA-AD 24 Conviction and Doubt                                             Of what can we be certain? The course explores the role of doubt throughout history and in various cultures. It will explore the capacity of doubt to endow human experience and knowledge with complexity and dimension. While belief can provide the scaffolding of a life, a community, and worldview, doubt has, throughout history, and in every part of the world, wrestled firmly held beliefs toward new invention and discovery creating pivotal moments of scientific, cultural, social and personal development. The course also focuses on the role of conviction and doubt in storytelling, examining precepts and dramatic principles that employ conviction and doubt toward a greater plurality. Through our readings and discussion students will examine the role of doubt and conviction in their daily lives. Close readings of select essays, texts, fables, koans, poetry, novels, plays, short stories and films will serve to map this exploration.

COREA-AD 27 Creativity and Innovation                                             This course will probe the heuristics of human innovation as understood by ancient and modern inventors and philosophers. The central question of this course are the following, What are the sources, requirements, and factors that influence human ingenuity? Is creativity a gift or a skill? How does creativity differ from innovation? To address these questions, we consider the earliest human inventions such as spears and simple tools; technological innovations that affected the course of human history; and inventions that shape our modern world. Throughout the course, a strong emphasis will be placed on developing a personal philosophy and methodology for creativity.

COREA-AD 28 Fame                                             Historian Leo Braudy notes that: &ldquo;the history of fame is also the history of the shifting definition of achievement in the social world.&rdquo; We will track early discourses of heroism and immortality from Alexander the Great to today&rsquo;s reality celebrities like Kim Kardashian. Beginning with concepts of fame in antiquity, we investigate Virgil&rsquo;s The Aeneid, The Bible, Homer's The Odyssey, and Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Richard III. The rise of contemporary stars across film, television, and theatre raises questions about the ways in which celebrities help manage historically conditioned categories of classification, such as gender, sexuality, race, class and nationality. Case studies of non-Western celebrities, highlight the formatting of modern stardom in Asia (Jackie Chan and Jet Li), Africa (Fela Kuti), and the Middle East (Umm Kulthum).

COREA-AD 29 Performing Body in History                                             This class examines the representation and theorization of the human body as evident in acting theory and performance practices. We will be particularly attentive to the international circulation of ideas of the body. To what extent are the commentaries of Ibn Rushd (Averroes) on Galen and Plato important to Renaissance Europe&rsquo;s understanding of the performing body? How has Tadashi Suzuki&rsquo;s interest in Noh, Kabuki, and Ancient Greek theatre informed his collaborations with major figures of the European theatre? Authors will include: Ibn Rushd, Plato, Zeami, Shakespeare, Diderot, Coleridge, Leigh Hunt, Brecht, Suzuki.

COREA-AD 30W Representations                                             This course will consider representations of social and historical realities within which notions of cultural identity, citizenship and power are imagined and presented. Using examples from the performing arts, film and photography, we explore formal technologies of creating representations and cultural modes of interpreting them, and compare how reality is abstracted and codified by representations from different parts of the world. Some of the examples are films such as Lawrence of Arabia, Mother India, Xala and Al Za&rsquo;eem; plays such as The Road, Al-Malik huwa I-Malik, and St Joan; photographs by Annie Liebovitz, Brian Duffy and Yousef Karsh. Basic semiotic, materialist and reception theories will offer prisms for our study. Key essays such as Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for the Pastness of India by Dipesh Charkravorty, Fictions of the Pose by Harry Berger, Imperialist Nostalgia by Renato Rosaldo, and Theorizing the Male Gaze by Edward Snow are read side by side videos of performances, films and slides of photographs.

COREA-AD 31W Machine Dreams                                             Machines have provided the means for artists to dream different worlds into existence. Machines impact how we structure our thoughts, our language, and even our bodies. We will examine how writers, visual artists, filmmakers and performers have creatively engaged both obsolete and emerging technologies&mdash;mirrors, camera obscuras, phonographs, photocopiers, projectors, telephones, computers, and satellites &mdash; to communicate shifts in how we perceive time, movement, space, similarity and difference among human beings, and operations of political power. We will study a variety of philosophers, scientists, anthropologists, cultural theorists, visual artists and playwrights including Horace, Euripides, Walter Benjamin, Donna Haraway, Michael Taussig, David Hockey, Ingres, Vermeer, Caravaggio, Chuck Close, films by the Lumiere Brothers and Jean Rouch, Apple Computer television commercials, and web-based performance/installation art by Stelarc, Electronic Disturbance Theatre, Emily Jacir, and Ai Weiwei.

COREA-AD 32 Identity: Text, Image, and Place                                             The course explores how image-based representations, written texts, and aspects of the built environment reflect certain conceptions of identity. The course considers paintings, photographs, video, ego documents, and journals. We will focus on artistic practices that examine and/or demonstrate personal or preconceived notions of identity through acts of self-representation. Our questions include: Why do artists from a particular region privilege certain issues over others? What extenuating circumstances may influence an artist's practice? How do artists consider Identity through examination of place? What role does gender or gendered stereotypes play in the production of art? How do artists represent themselves in order to challenge gender or cultural stereotypes?   \u2028We explore several media and methods of self-representation in artistic practice. Basic visual criticism techniques and theory is introduced in order to understand and differentiate between a wide range of artistic practices and intentions. The course considers artists from the USA, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and includes visits to local galleries and artist studios.

COREA-AD 33 Perception in Music and Sound                                             What is perception and how is it mediated by culture and technology? To what extent do objects of perception look and sound the same across individuals, cultures, and means of representation? How much of music is a function of the way our auditory system works and how much is learned as a part of culture? This class approaches these questions by looking at the scientific literature (to understand the basics of perception), by examining cultural objects such as musical instruments, scales, and performances (for specific examples that bring the ideas into focus) and by contrasting the various technologies for storing and reproducing sound.   * Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 26 May-20 June     Prerequisites : None.

Taking advantage of the multicultural nature of NYUAD, we will explore the cultural and universal mechanisms at play when we listen and understand music.

COREA-AD 35 Lies and Lying                                             Lying is an integral part of human communication. It is only in contrast to lies that we are able to construct the concept of truth and &ldquo;choose&rdquo; our perception of reality. From white lies and exaggerations to advanced techniques of persuasion such as propaganda and brainwashing, this course will examine the psychological, philosophical, ethical and social aspects of several contexts in which lying commonly occurs: Art, Culture, Literature, Science, Politics, Advertising, Journalism, Relationships, Digital World and History. We will discuss and analyze the motives, techniques, technology and outcomes of some of the biggest lies and liars throughout history, from mythological gods in ancient Greece through fake alchemists in the Islamic Golden Age to contemporary schemers. We will study examples of lying in texts, films, biographies, cartography, visual arts, internet, social networking, mass media, advertisement as well as guest liars and lying experts.

COREA-AD 36W Death: Myths, Histories, Metamorphoses                                             Death is a universal fact of human life, powerfully defining the exigencies of our experience. From ancient times until the present, artistic works have registered changing attitudes towards death in the stories they tell. In this seminar, we will examine artistic responses to mortality across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts&mdash;including in the myths of Orpheus and Osiris, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the text of the Ramayana; the poetry of Darwish, Neruda, and Rilke; stories by Tolstoy, Mishima, and Benjamin; and music of Dowland, Wagner, and Adams. Selected films and plays, including the Noh Drama of Japan, also are considered. Students develop a collaborative or individual artistic project and related critical paper demonstrating their engagement with the topic.

COREA-AD 37W Staging the Self                                             This course will examine the representation of personal experience in its biographical and autobiographical forms in the arts with a focus on performance. We pay particular attention to the ways in which personhood is aesthetically, psychologically, and politically theorized in different contexts. What does an individual&rsquo;s experience represent in specific art works? How is the relationship of individual experience to collective experience reconstructed in different arts works? Can individual experience portray collective historical reality? Should we understand an artist&rsquo;s oeuvre in relation to their personal life? In what ways do individual art works bestow human experience with specific epistemologies and with social and historical realities? Texts for the course include works by Irving Goffman, Errol Morris, Erik Erikson, Joseph Roach, Freddie Rokem, Deirdre Heddon, and selected plays, films and museum displays.

COREA-AD 38J Memory                                             Memory is a dynamic process influenced by internal and external factors. Internally, a person&rsquo;s individual memory content is overwritten each and every time something is remembered. Externally, memory is determined by social practices and, not least, our physical environment, shaping what may be called social or collective memory. The stability of the physical environment is a guarantor of an individual&rsquo;s memory and, by implication, identity, to a much greater extent than individual memory itself; it was as early as 2000 years ago that the nexus of the urban space and a stable memory was established (Cicero, Quintilian). The class will focus on theoretical concepts of memory in the fields of the arts, technology and invention in antiquity and the 20th century (Warburg, Halbwachs, Nora), discuss a novel that satirically memoriZes the fall of the Wall (Brussig) and provide numerous field trips that exemplify the concepts of social/collective memory based upon the urban space of Berlin (the replacement of the GDR Palace of the Republic by a reconstructed City Palace, Holocaust Memorial, Sinti and Roma Memorial, Jewish Museum, book burning memorial, Berlin Wall, Berlin Museums, the 3rd Reich Germania project).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREA-AD 39 Tools                                             We are habituated to think of tools as physical objects that facilitate utilitarian actions. Pencils, glassware, and hammers are tools of this type. However, the definition of a tool can be expanded beyond material objects, to include things like storytelling and the internet. Tools can facilitate interpersonal interactions and enable intimate communication, yet have no physical manifestation. This course studies the invention and use of tools across cultures and time. We examine a large number of examples, starting with languages, moving through tools like the wheel and metalwork to modern tools like software and network topologies, asking how our choice of tools changes the way we think about our goals.

COREA-AD 40 Records                                             What drives us to create records of human events or experience? And how has that drive shaped not only the history of human communication but of record-keeping itself? What is the relationship between an event and the records or recordings we make of it? Is there tension between the promise of mimetic or documentary fidelity and new possibilities for art and imagination? When is the memorializing goal better served by invention than recording? This course will examine a series of technological innovations in record-keeping and record-making, from cuneiform to cassette culture, mp3s, and beyond. Readings will address histories and theories of orality and literacy, archives, print, photography, film, sound recording, and other media as we explore fundamental questions about memory, history, technology, and the relationship between art and life.    Please note: Summer 2014 exams will be held on Saturday June 21.

COREA-AD 41 Nomads                                             What can the unique human ecology and worldview that emerges from mobile ways of life teach us about human ingenuity and culture? This course uses the lenses of philosophy, art, and design to examine the history, influence, and cultural underpinnings of nomadism and nomadic dwelling. Paying special attention to kinetic objects and the built environment, we will probe historical and contemporary conceptions of ownership and ecology, transience and permanence, home and homelessness, and citizenship and belonging. We will study writings by Deleuze and Guattari, Walter Benjamin, and Rosi Braidotti, artworks by Andrea Zittel, Lucy Orta, and Krzysztof Wodiczko and cinematic works including Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves. All aspects of mobile dwellings, from familiar vernacular models such as tents and huts to developments in humanitarian design and contemporary art, will be considered. Students will be presented with a series of design challenges and will be asked to solve problems by creating new designs and producing prototypes. No previous background or training in design is required.

COREA-AD 42 Art and Emotion                                             While Aristotle celebrated the capacity of art to elicit emotion, Plato treated it with suspicion. Suspected of irrationality, emotion has continued to hold a contested position in the understanding of art. This course will explore the ways that art both expresses and arouses the emotions and to what value and ends. It asks how stories engage us in prototypical, emotional human situations such as suffering, separation, loss, recognition and reunion. We will think about what aspects of our emotional responses are universal, what are culturally specific, what are gendered, what are individual and personal, and the similarities and differences between art emotions and actual emotions. We will draw on a wide range of artworks from a variety of periods and cultures as case studies, including visual and narrative representations of the Passion of Christ; canonical love stories, like Laila Majnun and Romeo and Juliet; classical and modern tragedy; romantic, popular, and program music; and comic art like The Comedy of Errors and silent film comedy. These studies will be framed by the theories of, among others, Aristotle, Abhinavagupta, Tolstoy, Langer, Bergson, Freud, analytic philosophy (Carroll, Kivy), and cognitive theory (Hogan).

What are the differences between wars in the past and those being waged today and how have the conditions of conflict changed throughout history? Is there an art of war? These questions are central to the purview of this course, which examines artistic responses to war across a wide range of historical and cultural contexts from antiquity to the present. The course explores how the arts, particularly music and musical practices, play a critical role in accompanying the sociological rituals of war from the military marches part of deployment, to the laments and requiems that figure centrally in process of mourning in the aftermath of conflict. Drawing on histories and philosophies of war, we will engage with issues related to propaganda, censorship, detention, internment, torture, heroism, sacrifice, bravery, justice, history, memory, and death and with reference to work by Homer, Thuclydides, Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Tolstoy, Shostakovitch, Britten, Picasso, Dix, Mishima, Wiesel, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and John Lennon, among others.

COREA-AD 44 Time                                             This course explores the multifaceted nature of time, in different historical, social and religious contexts. We will pursue three main strands: 1) changing conceptions of time, time-keeping systems, and states of time consciousness from antiquity to the present; 2) representations of time in works of art that heighten our apprehension of time or aim to escape the rule of time and induce a quality of timeless suspension; and 3) the technologies of time-keeping from sundials to atomic watches, calendars to timelines. Denaturalizing our own conventions of keeping time, we will consider the purposes of time measurement, the history of the hour, the development of the mechanical clock and its impact on society, the relationship between clock time and industrialization, the shift from local to international standard time, and the question whether the human experience of time is common across cultures or is culturally specific and variable.

An assumption which this course will make and explore is that all situations in the real world have a musical potential. This potential is defined and realized by discovering, recording and mapping the many ways in which the physical reality of places are dynamic systems of significant acoustic patterns. This seminar will start with an introduction to mobile sound recording that explores sound as it travels through the air in acoustic space using varieties of microphones and space mapping techniques. The course will also explore using acoustic measurement technologies such as accelerometers and hydrophones to investigate how sound exists within structures, the sea and other types of fluids. This course will start out with a large group sound mapping project about Saadiyat Island and expand to other environments in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. In addition to the group project, students will also be required to develop their own unique soundscape works. The course will cover all aspects of environmental field recording, editing and presentation of the final results.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course examines the role of technologies ranging from print, cave painting, comics, animation, and film, to hypertext, social media, and viral video. In addition to reading and viewing, the assignments will also include creative technological projects and excursions to the Museum of Moving Image, the Museum of Comics Art, and The Moth storytelling theater.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Topics include debates about the listening subject in Western philosophy and media studies; the role of the &lsquo;ethnographic ear&rsquo; in cultural anthropology and ethnomusicology; theories and methods of &lsquo;soundscape research&rsquo; and &lsquo;acoustemology&rsquo;; and aurality as an aspect of culture, explored through case studies ranging from the development of sound reproduction technologies, to deaf culture, to the ethics of sounding and listening in religious practice. Course readings, drawn from a wide range of disciplines, include foundational texts in the emerging interdisciplinary field of &lsquo;sound studies&rsquo;. In addition to engaging critically with a range of ideas and debates through discussion, presentations, and writing, students will try their ears at specialized modes of training and data collection developed by sound-oriented researchers and artists.

COREA-AD 48 Vision                                             This seminar concerns the phenomenon of vision. The sense of vision is closely related to processes of understanding, thought, and linguistic interpretation. Seeing is an activity in which the eye and brain work together, but the imagination also affects vision, for we sometimes imagine what we say we see. We will study the connection of image and language using the example of Hollis Frampton&rsquo;s film Nostalgia, which suggests that vision entails an aspect of imagining. We will approach questions about the nature of vision on the basis of texts, cinematic materials, art works, and experiments we conduct. The texts on which we will work include &ldquo;classical&rdquo; ones by authors such as Charles Baudelaire and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, but also more recent theoretical approaches by Serge Daney, for example. We will also focus on the phenomenon of synaesthesia as it is emphasized as &lsquo;haptic seeing&rsquo; in the work of Lygia Clark.

COREA-AD 49 Collecting                                             What motivates human beings to form collections? How do we select, order, preserve and display information and objects? And, what intellectual processes are involved in these activities? What does the content of these collections say about those who created them? And, what kind of narratives can be traced within the display of these collections? This course surveys the phenomenon of collecting, focusing on key moments in its history, from antiquity up to contemporary times. In the first section of the class, we explore collections of &ldquo;thought,&rdquo; that is, how knowledge has been stored, organized and retrieved &ndash; and some of the tools we have developed to do so &ndash; including mnemonic devices, writing, codices, libraries, information architecture and digital technologies. The second section concerns physical objects, and their collection, classification, organization, and display. Finally, we discuss the work of modern and contemporary artists who incorporate concepts of assemblage and curation. In response to the readings and to the materials covered in class, students will conceive, create, describe and display a collection of their own making.

COREA-AD 50W Identity and Object                                             This course asks how objects from the past obtain meaning long after they were made, and how they have come to express the identity of communities, nations, and religions. We will consider fundamental questions of identity by assessing how objects become imbued with meaning. Who ascribes these objects meaning and why? How do we relate to objects designated to represent us? We will explore object biographies from a range of periods, regions and traditions. We will discuss objects representing contested national and global identities, such as the Cyrus Cylinder from Iraq, and the Koh-i-noor diamond from India, as well as material that facilitates discussion of socially and culturally defined identities. In all of these examples politics plays a constant role. Through case studies of iconic objects from around the world, we will compare significance in the originating society with place and function today to better understand how, why, and by whom identity is constructed.

COREA-AD 51 Wood                                             Wood is inseparably linked to human history and culture. From mankind&rsquo;s earliest use of sticks for shelter, warmth and gathering food, the increasingly complex ways that we have used and understood this material reflect the history of civilization itself. What can wood can teach us about ecology, human history, ingenuity and culture? By examining wood&#39;s role across several diverse cultures, this class will consider our ever evolving relationship to wood through its use in architecture, art and design. We will study the work of artists and designers including Richard Deacon, Koki Tanaka, Louise Bourgeois, Giuseppe Penone, Bill Reid, Charles and Ray Eames, El Anatsui, Henry Moore, and Ai Weiwei. We will also examine the lore and mythology of wood through literary works like the Epic of Gilgamesh, Hermann Hesse&rsquo;s Siddhartha, Shel Silverstein&rsquo;s The Giving Tree, Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce&rsquo;s Flaming Green Tree Trilogy, Betty Smith&rsquo;s A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, the Enchanted Forests of the Brothers Grimm, J.R.R. Tolkien&rsquo;s Lord of the Rings, and Michael Pollan&rsquo;s Botany of Desire. The class will include a practical studio component in which students learn historic and contemporary woodworking techniques, respond to carpentry design challenges, and develop a kinesthetic knowledge and materials understanding through the exploration and manipulation of wood and wood-based materials. No previous background or training is required.

COREA-AD 52 Play                                             We are engaged in play throughout our lives. It socializes and engages us in a deeply meaningful way that serves as an essential component of our education in the world. Beginning with the imaginative and open-ended games of our childhood, and continuing through more structured aspects of play like sport, theatre, board and video games, it serves a vital tool in our development as individuals. It can be collaborative or competitive, open-ended or closed, but always is innately fun. Examining the topic from a variety of perspectives, including psychological, artistic and philosophical, we will engage with multiple levels of playfulness throughout history, from simple childhood escapism to urban scale games facilitated by new technologies . Students will be challenged to create new forms of play by prototyping and designing their own games and frameworks for play throughout the semester.

COREA-AD 53 Abjection                                             How do we build an identity? What is rejected or expelled from us? This fundamental aspect of the human condition underlies the notion of abjection: a detached and degraded state or the act of causing it. The abject, renounced in oneself or cast out of society, takes various forms: from the maternal body and the corpse to social minorities and refugees. It implies some trauma or taboo that disturbs the symbolic order of law and norms. This course asks how abjection occurs on many levels and how it can also catalyze new modes of life and community. We trace it in terms of horror, repulsion, beauty, sexuality, multiculturalism, terrorism, etc., and highlight today&rsquo;s abjection that is generated in global systems and revealed through violence or catastrophe, yet also with positive potential. We explore film (Fassbinder, Sissako, Folman, Eastwood, Von Trier, Sono Shion), literature (Kafka, Genet, Beckett, Yi Sang), art and performance (Bacon, Sherman, Stelarc, Zhu Yu), along with psychoanalysis, feminism, philosophy, aesthetics, and trans-historical material from myths and religions to punk rock and cyber culture.

COREA-AD 56 The Idea of the Garden                                             Gardens are as diverse as cultures, but the idea of the garden is common to various cultures through the ages and across continents. What do gardens tell us about the human condition? How do gardens relate to the individual and the idea of community? How do they reflect philosophical ideas? In which ways do the real and imagined interfere with each other? Is a garden a representation of nature or culture or both? How does a garden relate to spiritual needs and sensual experience (smell, sound, sight, tactile and kinesthetic bodily feeling)? How is the idea of the garden distinguished from but related to the notion of a natural landscape? We will look at Zen-gardens and rooftop gardens, monastic and palace gardens, sculpture and pleasure gardens, mythic gardens in various religious traditions. The course is conceived as neither a historical survey nor typological compilation but chooses diverse examples of gardens and representations of gardens from various cultures and historical periods in order to reflect on the ways in which gardens reflect the human condition.

COREA-AD 57 Touch                                             It is easy to have an idea of the effects of significant loss of vision or hearing by closing our eyes or by wearing earplugs. What about a significant loss of the sense of touch? What would that be like? The answer might not come readily due in part to the subtle, effortless performance of the sense of touch. Far from being just an immediate skin sensation, touching is intimately blended into embodied experiences that are affectionate, expressive, personal and interpersonal. Indeed, the haptic modality is the fundamental mode of access to the physical properties of the world. This course provides a multidisciplinary, cross-cultural introduction to the dynamics and salience of the human sense of touch, and runs a continuous thread for a number of fundamental questions and critical approaches that twenty-first-century haptic scholars embrace. A wide variety of interpretations, disciplines and experiences exploring the symbolic, cultural, ethical, social and technical aspects of haptic communication will be discussed. Topics covered in this course include social and cultural development, memory, learning, digital design, experiences of visual impairment, tactile therapies, human computer interaction, multimodal interaction and sensory substitution, funneling illusion and apparent motion, and privacy and security.

COREI-AD 10 Quantum Theory and Relativity: The Impact of a Scientific Revolution                                             At the beginning of the 20th century, a scientific revolution started that was destined to change radically the way we think about the physical world. Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity completely altered notions of time and space, laying the theoretical foundation for the use of nuclear power. At the same time, a new quantum theory was developed to describe the behavior of atoms and nuclei. It led to great technological advances, with much modern technology crucially exploiting quantum effects. But the revolutionary advent of relativity and quantum mechanics came with significant consequences: Physics became detached from the public&rsquo;s everyday experiences and intuition. Challenging that notion of inaccessibility, this course analyzes some of the basic concepts of relativity and quantum theory.

Issues such as energy consumption, CO2 emissions, climate change, food production, water, and material fluxes are intricately tied together as a global system. The economic trend of this system can be used to project a world in 2050 in which the world&#39;s lifestyle will be approximately equal to that of many developed nations today. Will this projected state of the world be possible, given the environmental issues above? Investigating this topic in Sydney gives us perspective from a developed nation with unique climate, resources, and world famous biodiversity. Substantial portions of this inquiry-based seminar require students to compare environmental issues in Australia to those in their home nations, other developed regions, and the world, in order to look at how conditions and solutions in Australia might be generally applicable to shared challenges.

How do programs (software applications) make computers behave intelligently and allow them to solve problems effectively for a wide range of applications and fields, from art and other media to education, medicine, and the core sciences? How do we use computer programs to process, structure, and manage information, create and manipulate digital media, and search and gather information relevant to any particular topic? How do computer programs operate virtually, creating the World Wide Web of the modern digital age, and how does all of this effect issues related to security and privacy in the wired world we live in today? Students are asked to create innovative programming solutions to a set of problems and develop applications focused on the social good for their final project. The programming language of choice is Python, a relatively easy programming language with powerful visual, text processing, and graphics capabilities. This course is intended for students from different disciplines (outside the sciences); no prerequisite is needed.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

Perhaps such fear is warranted since many human diseases, including cystic fibrosis and cancer, are caused by &ldquo;mutations&rdquo;, which are mere changes in the genetic information in DNA. Starting with basic concepts, this course explores important cellular macromolecules, such as DNA, and proteins as well as their three-dimensional structures that endow them with their specific functions. In fact, understanding how mutations induce alterations to macromolecular structures often sheds light on the characteristic symptoms and prognoses of some human diseases and syndromes. Laboratory projects, which focus on introduction to computer modeling, emphasize visualizing in a three-dimensional environment the normal and altered macromolecules associated with some common but complex human maladies.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 15 Microbes                                             Microbes are tiny organisms that are found on every imaginable surface and habitat. This complex myriad can consist of microbes that are essential to a healthy life, as well as microbes that cause infectious diseases in plants and animals, which may also contribute to many chronic diseases and conditions, such as cancer and environmentally-related diseases. To understand the delicate and complex relationship we have with these different forms of microbes, scientists have looked at their DNA for clues and answers to their causes, developing tools to help with diagnostic tests, and the development of treatments and prevention methods. This information also comes with various social, ethical, and political implications that determine how we use our knowledge of these microbes. This course will introduce students to these issues by first learning the fundamentals of the biological molecules that comprise the cell and through a hands-on research project, students will identify the local microbes through their DNA. Students will also discuss how microbes positively and negatively affect the various policy options that are relevant to the social dilemmas that science created.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

As a result, the world&#39;s natural coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course uses the built and natural environments of coastal cities as laboratories to explain the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas. Using data from multiple coastal cities, student teams use field-based studies and Geographic Information System (GIS) data to examine patterns and processes operating in coastal cities. This course uses the local terrestrial marine, and built environments as a laboratory to address these issues, and team projects requiring field work form a core component of the learning experience. As part of the NYU Global Network University initiative this course is being offered simultaneously in several NYU sites globaly and students are collaborating extensively with students from their sister campuses through the duration of this course.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 17 Domain of Crystals                                             Knowing the three-dimensional structure of a molecule is important for understanding its functional properties. Is it indeed possible to visually analyze a molecule and use the observed experimental data to build a three-dimensional model? This structural information can be obtained using a variety of analytical techniques such as X-ray crystallography, and can lead to significant breakthroughs in pharmaceutics. Students grow crystals of different colors, shapes, and sizes and harvest them for physical and morphological characterization in order to understand the basic principles of atomic structure and theory, chemical bonding and reactions, thermochemistry, periodicity, and solution chemistry.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 19S The Power of Genes                                             Will genetic manipulation ever improve our well-being? When the gene was discovered and our ability to manipulate it became apparent, a whole new era in science began. Scientists wanted to understand the power that hides in the gene and the effects of its manipulation. The Human Genome Project which was completed in 2003 led to the identification of the genes in the Human DNA. This discovery is now leading the way to trying to understand the roles of those genes in our bodies, the diseases that may result from their malfunctioning, and consequently treating those diseases at the gene level. This growing field is known as Gene Therapy. In another endeavor and due to the increase in the human population size and the depletion of our food resources, biologists invested in the ability to Genetically Modify Foods; a matter that has raised concerns in some parts of the world. Also, our desire to understand how life was created has led to Cloning investigations; an issue of huge controversy. This course travels through the world of genetics and examines the Human Genome Project, successful stories and challenges in the field of Gene Therapy, Genetically Modified Foods, and Cloning; all being topics that have fundamental implications on the society that will live in and contribute towards.

COREI-AD 21S Serendipity in Science                                             In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale &ldquo;The Three Princes of Serendip,&rdquo; whose heroes &ldquo;were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.&rdquo; In the ensuing centuries, the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improve our standard of living.

COREI-AD 22S Trust, Risk, and Deception in Cyberspace                                             Cyberspace is playing an increasing role in our lives, and our society is rapidly becoming structured around the 24/7 availability and trustworthiness of information systems. We already entrust cyberspace with our privacy, national security, physical safety, and digital identities. Maintaining an orderly, peaceful, safe, and productive society will increasingly depend on maintaining trust in information systems. However, trust cannot be realized by technology alone. This course adopts the viewpoint that cyberspace is essentially a social system that relies on important technical components. The course will begin with a discussion of trust, risk and deception as developed in the social sciences and examine how traditional notions apply or fail to apply to interactions in cyberspace. In the second part of the course we will examine the technical underpinning of cyberspace and the mechanisms that have been developed to create trustworthy systems. In the third and final part of the course we will examine the interplay between the technical and social aspects and see how better policy and systems can be developed to tackle cybercrime, cyberespionage, cyberwar and cyberterrorism. A computer science or engineering knowledge is not necessary for taking this course.

COREI-AD 23 Copernican Revolution                                  Before Copernicus, the earth was regarded as the stable center of the universe. Coming to accept the earth&rsquo;s rotation and motion around the sun was one of science&rsquo;s greatest shocks to humanity&rsquo;s understanding of our place in the order of things. We investigate the structure of the theories that preceded Copernicus, and the various sorts of arguments&mdash;empirical, conceptual, and even religious&mdash;that were made for and against his account. Our aim is to appreciate how scientific theories of the world are constructed, criticized and defended. Texts include relevant parts of Aristotle and Ptolemy, Galileo&rsquo;s Starry Messenger and On The Two Chief Worlds Systems , Thomas Kuhn &lsquo;s The Copernican Revolution , Bertold Brecht&rsquo;s Galileo , and Paul Feyerabend&rsquo;s Against Method .

COREI-AD 24J Heuristics                                             Many problems in science, business, and politics require heuristics -- problem solving techniques that often work well even if not perfectly. This course teaches heuristics as they have applied in the design of scientific experiments, the solution of problems global power politics, and in the resolution of economic negotiations. While being exposed to heuristic techniques, students work in small teams that compete with one another to design strategies to solve new puzzles better than other teams. You are given computational tools as needed, but the course has no programming prerequisite. To take this course, you should love to think both qualitatively and quantitatively. Among the specific problems we will tackle include the design of currencies, leasing strategies for oil exploration, optimal matchmaking, and efficient experimental design. The intent is to make you better able to face complex problems in any field you choose.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

As a result, Australia&#39;s coastal environments have been substantially modified to suit human needs. This course will use the built and natural environments of Sydney, Australia&#39;s largest city, as a case study to examine the environmental and ecological implications of urban development in coastal areas worldwide. Using Sydney&#39;s terrestrial, marine, and built environments as a natural laboratory for field research, students will collect environmental data throughout the city and use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial patterns of human impacts to Sydney&#39;s environment and to compare their results with patterns observed in other coastal cities.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 27 Evolution: The Incredible Human Journey                                  What we consider modern human society represents a tiny and very peculiar blip in the very long history of human beings on this planet. Whether we consider the 10,000 year history of settled civilization, the 200,000 year history of anatomically modern humans, or the 6 million year history of &ldquo;proto-humans&rdquo; since our divergence from our closest species relatives, to fully understand human society is to consider the incredible journey that has led our species to where we are now. Through an investigation of art, archaeology, psychology, anthropology, and deep history, and with the use of films, myths and scientific research, we explore this epic journey and the legacy that it has left on humanity.

COREI-AD 29J Causality                                             When is it legitimate to conclude that A causes B? In human history, causality was sometimes the province of the gods as in there is lightening because a god is throwing bolts at the earth. The introduction of Aristotelian logic permitted the development of deductive logic and the notion of consistency. Because deduction manipulates knowledge but does not add to it, natural science uses induction in which universal causal laws are believed because of experiments at a few times and places. This course begins with a discussion of the history of the arguments for causality, then it embarks on a detailed discussion of certain great experiments and the conclusions that resulted. In the process, we discuss how the progress of science determines what is accepted as a cause, from the \"taint\" of an ancestral line to the psychological impacts of childhood. Next, we discuss the inference of causality by machine. Students will work on projects involving the construction of experiments (either ones we have discussed or others), the discovery of the laws of a simulated world that the instructor has created, and then playing a game in that world.

COREI-AD 30 The Mind                                             This course explores the perennial question, how does the mind work? We learn how philosophers, computer scientists, neuroscientists, psychologists, and linguists have answered this question. We consider several stimulating but demanding questions about the nature of the mind and try to understand how the mind enables such things as perception, thinking, and behavior. We review the historical and scientific developments the lead to the contemporary consensus that the human mind is fundamentally a computational organ and explores some of the challenges that this view poses to our common sense understanding of certain attributes, like consciousness and free will, that ascribe to ourselves as human beings.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

What principles are preserved? Considering the classical Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, the question of how and to what extent culture determines the paradigms of science is investigated. We begin with formative texts from the Chinese, Indian and Western traditions, including the Rig Veda, the Upanishads (India), the I Jing, Dao De Jing, and the neo-Confucian synthesis (China) and the pre-Socratic Ionian physicists (Western), then turn to the development of modern science. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read in parallel with seminal texts describing the rise of modern science in China and India. The course will conclude with a survey of contemporary cosmological theories to see how some ancient ideas are retained in modern science.

We first consider weather patterns around the globe and ask whether the occurrence of &ldquo;weird weather&rdquo; corresponds to the emergence of worldwide disruption. Then we study physical processes, such as radiation, clouds, and wind, that are at the core of both weather and climate, and discuss how human activities can affect them. Finally, we use this understanding to consider predictions of future climate change,  the impact on different parts of the globe, possible remedies and how they might be implemented.

COREI-AD 33S Snap Judgments                                             Daily experience attests that the briefest of glances at other people often suffices to furnish a wealth of socially relevant information about them. From minimal visual cues, for instance, we can infer group memberships (e.g., sex and age), emotional states, personality traits, and even a person&rsquo;s intentions. The dexterity with which humans deduce such knowledge has fascinated ancient philosophers and contemporary thinkers alike. As a result, much thought has been dedicated towards a process that typically unfolds within less than a second. Based on this work, films, literary texts, and scientific evidence are presented to explore the perceptual, cognitive, and emotional mechanisms that underlie common snap judgments in person evaluation. The accuracy of these judgments, their neural foundation, and the societal consequences of rapidly assessing others are discussed.

COREI-AD 34 From Vision to Visual                                             In 300 BC, Euclid first described Vision as the process by which rays traveled in a straight line from the eye to the object seen. Since ancient times, our curiosity about vision has propelled the invention of tools to enlarge information that could not be perceived with the naked eye and to make sense of the world around us. This course explores the development of optics and its influence on visual communication. How has our understanding of vision been communicated and changed over time? How successful have we been in &ldquo;visualizing&rdquo; the visual network that we are concurrently studying and trying to decipher? As we shed light on the visual code, we will highlight the importance of visualization tools in advancing scientific research. Has film informed or misinformed the science of visual perception and is there such a thing as the &quot;objective eye?&quot;                                                                       Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alexis Gambis                                           -             MW, 11:35-12:50                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Alexis Gambis                                           -             MW, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREI-AD 35 Seven Wonders of the Invisible World                                             &ldquo;In the year of 1657 I discovered very small living creatures in rain water.&rdquo; This quote is attributed to Anton van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch merchant whose skillful use of glass lenses allowed him to peer into a world of microorganisms that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. A special emphasis will be placed on capturing images of seven wonders of the invisible world - natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally-occurring crystals.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 38J Introduction to Imaging Spectroscopy in the Study of Old Master Paintings                                  Works of art, like all objects, absorb, emit and reflect light at specific wavelengths. This gives every object its own unique pattern, known as its spectral signature. Imaging spectroscopy enables us to image these spectral signatures, and the subsequent processing of these images allows the analysis and identification of materials to take place without the need to sample the object. Imaging spectroscopy was developed for the remote sensing of the Earth and more recently Mars, and has in the last decade been applied to the study of works of art in ways not before possible. In this short course students will be introduced by a leading imaging scientist to imaging spectroscopy, and will apply it to study the materials and working methods of medieval and Renaissance painters. Students will be introduced to the fundamentals of the scientific method by examination of several paintings in the Acton Collection at NYU-Florence, Villa la Pietra, will learn about how scientists and conservators work together to interpret the resulting data, and will expand their knowledge of the history of art and artists' materials.

COREI-AD 39S Complexity                                             Underlying the order of natural systems and the simple rules they would appear to follow, is complexity born from the large number of objects under consideration and the functional connections between these objects at hierarchies of scale. The science of complexity, and goal of this course, concerns how to model such systems as connected networks so that we may understand better how the objects of disparate systems become self-organized, robust to disruption, and connected by links that increase in number/length according to common mathematical power laws. Topics for discussion are drawn from physical (e.g., geology, astronomy), biological (e.g., ecology, medicine), and social (e.g., economy, communications) systems. A consideration of the complexity of our own neural network, evincing conscious and unconscious benefits and hindrances to our behavior, will highlight an appreciation for the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon we call creativity, which characterizes our search for new unknowns in science.

COREI-AD 40 Idea of the Cell                                             Proteins and organic compounds came together over three billion years ago to form the first cell. However, we have only been able to see cells for approximately 300 years through the microscope. In the early days of cellular imaging, the cell body was figuratively represented as buzzing cities or mythological realms. Today, the power of electron microscopy and animation reveal more details about the inner life of cells than ever before, and yet subjective and singular interpretations of the cell have persisted. This course explores cellular identity in the context of visual imagery and advances in visualization. Students will express their own ideas of the cell by creating original short films.

These four examples offer excellent learning templates for exploring public health because of their diversity: one has ended (smallpox), one is current near eradication (polio), one is an infectious disease for which no vaccine exists (AIDS) and one is a fully preventable human-manufactured epidemic (tobacco). The course will include a mix of lecture, class exercises, the role of games in health education, CSI-like investigation approaches, guest lectures and site visits based in Washington, DC. Students become familiar with how an epidemic emerges, steps taken to measure an epidemic&#39;s scope and distribution, how epidemiologists-the detectives of public health-go about determining the source of an epidemic, the role research plays in answering questions with respect to source and cure, how public health leaders work to arrest an epidemic and the interplay between society, culture, politics and health.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 42S Uncertainty in Science                                             Science is fundamentally about exploring the unknown, and a major part of being a scientist is learning how to handle uncertainty. Statistical uncertainty, systematic uncertainty, the range of validity of models, approximations, data outliers, competing interpretations: scientists spend most of their time wrestling with these problems. Unfortunately, in classrooms and in popular culture, science is often presented as a series of proven facts. If uncertainty is acknowledged, it is often portrayed as an argument between two groups of experts with opposing views. While science has resulted in some well established facts, and scientists occasionally have clear-cut divisions of opinion, more commonly they have varying degrees of confidence in models and disagree about the significance of a particular measurement or study. In this class, we familiarize ourselves with the language of probability and statistics, explore how it developed historically to become central to the scientific process, and how it is used by different scientific disciplines. We discuss how scientists express their ignorance, and how individuals and policy makers can still make judgments based on incomplete scientific knowledge. We also explore how scientific uncertainty is often misrepresented to support particular political agendas or personal beliefs. Finally, we discuss the limits of scientific knowledge, and how even when exact solutions to problems are not theoretically possible, we can still put limits on our uncertainty.

COREI-AD 43 Behavior                                             Why we behave in a certain way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. So what drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, economics, psychology and philosophy. We will place an emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments that measure behavior in both humans and animals. We will discuss topics as diverse as memory, morality and altruism and examine how being part of small and large groups can affect decision-making and behavior.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.

COREI-AD 44 What is Number?                                             Numbers pervade our lives, so it may seem self-evident what they are. But like languages, technologies or ideologies, numbers have a history, and understanding of them has changed over time and also been surprisingly controversial. Zero was discovered and accepted as a number 1500 years ago; it was considered a dangerous idea in some civilizations. The existence of infinity was fiercely debated by philosophers as well as mathematicians. Understanding numbers requires insights from the liberal arts of the ancient quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry, and astronomy) considered in their unity through their relationships with numbers. Pythagoras, Plato, Al-Kindi, Kepler, Turing, Mandelbrot and others have thought about concepts of measure, order, chaos, harmony, unity, diversity and universality. Reading these authors will help us understand why even today&rsquo;s science has no definitive answer to the apparently simple question about its faithful servants: what is a number?

COREI-AD 45SW Progress in Science                                             Science is a social enterprise, although one traditionally thought to be grounded in facts and reason. Scientists collaborate with each other, undermine one another, and compete for funding of research. Whether a scientific idea ever sees the light of day may depend on these distinctly social factors. So how much of what we call &lsquo;scientific progress&rsquo; is the result of social negotiation, and how much is rational deliberation? That is the big question this course investigates&mdash;the question of the competing roles of rationality and rhetoric in the development of science. Do theoretical pictures change on account of reasoned argument, or rhetorical persuasion? We&#39;ll examine this question through the lens of several important scientific revolutions, particularly the quantum one. Our starting point will be Thomas Kuhn&rsquo;s influential account of scientific progress. Does his picture really fit the historical facts? Several competing models of scientific progress will also be discussed. Along the way, we&rsquo;ll consider why many scientific revolutions occurred in Europe and not elsewhere.

COREI-AD 46S Languages                                                        Our guiding question emerges from the story of Babel: why are there many languages? Should we view linguistic diversity on par with superficial cultural differences, as reflecting essential differences in modes of thinking, or as products of incommensurate world views? This question will be explored across disciplines, from the philosophical discussion of the (im)possibility of translation, through the literary theoretic debate about the connection between speech and writing, to recent discussions in psychology and anthropology about linguistic determinism (language determining thought or culture determining language). These debates across intellectual traditions center around the key question of the source of linguistic universals: do commonalities among languages reflect an innate brain &quot;organ&quot; or do they reflect commonalities in human culture and in general human cognitive capabilities. The linguist&rsquo;s argument for an innate universal grammar invites us to view language history in biblical terms, as the cultural fall from a single original language, fixed by biology, but such biological determinism is also consistent with the idea that the multi-lingual cosmopolitan human has always been our natural state.

COREI-AD 47S Heat and the Universe                                             This course asks what temperature reveals about the past and future of our species, planet and universe. Scientific measurements of temperature only began in the 17th century and the meaning of temperature was not fully understood until the 19th century. We will examine how that understanding developed and how temperature came to provide a key ingredient in the scientific toolbox. Its study will be used as a unifying guide to examine a wide range of phenomena in our natural world, from the cooling of the Universe in the first minutes of its expansion after the Big Bang to the role that temperature fluctuations have played in the Earth&rsquo;s history and the threats posed by global warming. Biological adaptations to different degrees of hot and cold will be examined through the action of heat and cold loving bacteria and through the techniques mammals have adopted for temperature regulation. Readings will be in the history of science and in both primary and secondary sources in physics, astronomy, biology and geology.

COREI-AD 48J Big Data from Gauss to Genomics and Facebook                                             Big Data is the science of large data sets. These sets have appeared in rising volume, variety and velocity during the last decade. The rise of big data is due chiefly to data collection via social networks, E-commerce and web navigation, but other types of data collection, related to phones, medicine or world trade are also involved. How do we get relevant information from these large data sets? For example, based on a very accurate analysis of their own collected data sets, companies as Google, Amazon, Facebook or Netflix manage to get significant hints about what should interest specific customers. Data analysis is also becoming more important in healthcare with personalized medicine. This course takes a cross-disciplinary approach to Big Data, beginning with the sources and applications of Big Data, such as business, genomics, economics, and sociology. Then, we will look at how statistics and computer science (via machine learning) aid the analysis of data sets.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 49J Science in Flux: The Galilean Revolution                                             How does science develop and change? What sorts of considerations are used to assess and evaluate scientific theories, particularly when those theories upend our entire picture of the physical world and our place in it? Are there factors that go beyond the empirical data itself, such as broader conceptual and religious considerations? And are these &lsquo;extra-empirical&rsquo; considerations legitimate constraints on scientific inquiry? This course will examine these big questions about the nature of science in the context of Galileo&rsquo;s groundbreaking theory on the nature of motion&mdash;a theory that laid the groundwork for Newton and the rise of modern science. We will look at the many conflicts in which Galileo became embroiled&mdash;scientific, religious, and personal&mdash;and study the historical developments that eventually led to widespread acceptance of the Galilean worldview. Our aim will be to understand the complicated way in which Galileo&rsquo;s physics emerged, was resisted, and eventually triumphed, and to situate that evolution within a broader narrative about the nature of scientific development and change.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Biomimetics is defined as the structure and function of biological systems as models for the design and engineering of materials.This introductory course reviews the complexities in natural materials following millions of years of evolution and how efficient they are in comparison to standard engineering materials in performing specific tasks. The course will also present students with the basic concepts of engineering materials (metals, ceramics, polymers, semiconductors) and their structure/property relationship and how current manufacturing techniques inspire scientists to recreate nature-like structures to improve current engineering practice. The course is geared to the classroom and experimental laboratory setting where students manipulate materials and explore material properties for biomimetic design.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 52J Computational Tools for Cultural Comparison                                             Different cultures have both unique and common properties. These can be linguistic properties, properties of politeness, of government, of art, of economics, of food, of gender relationships, and even of war. Tools for cross-cultural comparison should allow those who are familiar with only a few cultures to enter properties and values about those cultures and then allow searchers to compare the cultures in various ways. For example, it should be possible to discover the commonalities and differences among pairs of cultures, to cluster many cultures based on their commonalities, and to find cultural rules of the form &quot;if culture has property x, then it has property y&quot;. This course will begin with the discussion of a key cultural notion-- language. You will learn the basics of linguistics and then will interact with a cross-cultural database and analysis platform called Terraling. We will also study data sets that may be useful for cross-cultural analysis mostly from the social sciences, anthropology, and archaeology. After that, you will engage in projects to use Terraling to enter other properties and values about a topic of your choice (e.g. about food, legal structure etc.). Some of that data will come from the data sets others have gathered that are on the web and some will come from data that you yourselves gather. In the process you will learn elements of statistics, machine learning, programming in Python, and experimental design and evaluation.    *All COREI-EDNW courses are replaced with COREX.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

COREI-AD 53 About Mathematics                                             Mathematics takes its problems from the real world and puts order into chaos. It sometimes strongly challenges common sense and produces extraordinary dreams of human history. The course concerns questions and concepts from various areas in mathematics, in particular number theory: the ``alarm clock numbers&#39;&#39; and some of their applications (for example to music) ; irrational numbers and their intimate links with art and geometry as well as the scandal raised by their discovery in ancient Greece ; the Golden Ratio with its surprising mathematical properties, its connections with biology through Fibonacci sequences and art history; prime numbers and their chaos, order and mystery ; the fantastic number &pi;, some of its properties, and messy and beautiful formulae to approach it ; continued fractions, the sum of two-squares theorem ; the five (or three) Platonic solids from prehistory to modern times ; some amazing paradoxes raised by probabilities ; and Poincar&eacute; finite-infinite universe. Through these and other examples we will consider how and why mathematics is a subversive intellectual activity, relying on passion, imagination, and beauty as much as on logic and rigorous argumentation.

We will examine the origin of human diversity, how human diversity is measured and analyzed, and how our perception of diversity has changed through history. Emphasis will be placed on recent progress in genetics and evolution and how this progress affects our daily life and identity. Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments.

Are diseases actors in their own right? What determines who falls sick and who dies? This course explores the complex relationship between disease and society, between the natural and social worlds. Our focus is on understanding how people have explained, argued about, and responded to diseases in different social contexts over time. The course readings consist of books drawn from a range of disciplines.                       This course is writing intensive .

COREI-AD 56S Future of Medicine                                             How will medicine evolve in the future? Will doctors ever be able to prevent disease rather than react to it? And can your DNA sequence be used to develop personalized treatments? Healthcare is arguably the most important place where science meets society, and technical advances in science are raising important ethical issues about healthcare, such as genetic discrimination and designer babies. This course will look at the science, economics and politics behind medicine and healthcare systems, and use medicine as a tool to study the relative roles of the individual and government.

COREI-AD 57 Thinking                                             Thinking is what we do when we solve problems, compare alternatives, and plan for the future. But what is thinking, and how do thoughts form? People throughout history have come to very different answers to this question and have offered different metaphors for thought. The French Philosopher Descartes drew inspiration for his theories of the mind from mechanisms that were powered by pneumatics. Our modern understanding of thinking is shaped by the computer revolution. The class will discuss the underpinnings of the main fields of Psychology (e.g. Behaviorism, Freudian, Cognitive), as well as to how thinking has been viewed in a broader historical and multicultural context. We will explore how thoughts on thinking have shaped our understanding of who we are; and how our metaphors of thought have been inspired by technological developments and shaped by culture.

COREI-AD 58 Words                                             Words, words, words. Words are the basic units of language, but how do they help us communicate our thoughts? How are they internally constructed? And how do they come together to form complex meanings? How are words from different languages similar, and how are they different? Do words reflect or shape our thought? Do they expand or constrain our imagination? This interdisciplinary course explores what words are and how we think of them. The course brings together insights and ideas from a number of fields: linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology, computer science, history, literature, religion and visual arts to help answer these questions. Students will read materials from a variety of books and articles and discuss them in class, and they will engage in solving and creating language puzzles. Students will learn how to analyze words in terms of their form, function and meaning in context. Term projects can range from collection and analysis of linguistic data to multidisciplinary artistic creations.

COREI-AD 60 Concepts and Categories: How We Structure the World                                             Humans have a strong tendency to group and divide objects, people, emotions, and events into different concepts and categories. These seemingly effortless acts pose fundamental questions about our understanding of the self and the nature of the world. In this course, we will read texts from history, literature, philosophy, and scientific sources, and discuss why we conceptualize the world in particular ways, whether any categories are fundamental, and the degree to which concepts and categories are innate or learned. From the conceptual taxonomies proposed as fundamental from thinkers such as Aristotle and Kant, to the findings from psychology and neuroscience that inform us about our predilections for object concepts and social groups, we will reflect on what this knowledge can tell us about the forces that shape self and society.

COREI-AD 61 Modern Drug Discovery                                             Pharmaceuticals are the most important component of modern medicine. Prescription and non-prescription drugs are the primary method used to treat a myriad of maladies: minor headaches, cold and flu symptoms, postoperative pain, bacterial infections, diabetes, cancer, AIDS, heart disease, high blood pressure, and others. Drugs approved for use in humans follow a long pathway from discovery to the market, and every drug has a fascinating human and scientific story of creativity (and in some cases serendipity), diligence, and perseverance. This course examines through case studies the history of drug discovery and the people who engage in it; the scientific breakthroughs made in the course of discovering and developing drugs; the process and ethical dimensions of how drug candidates are identified, evaluated for safety and efficacy, approved for sale, and marketed and distributed globally; the protection of intellectual property; and the consequences for human health and well-being.

COREI-AD 63 The Ethics and Politics of Public Health                                             The media presents a flood of findings and recommendations about public health based on epidemiological studies, some of it contradictory to the last published findings. Then, many of these findings and resultant policies meet with vigorous, and even volatile, opposition from citizen-groups. This course will explore the complex question of: How do historically powerful and enduring cultural influences (such as paternalism, racism, sexism, capitalism, ethnocentricity and &lsquo;causation-ism&rsquo;) contribute to volatile reactions to epidemiological findings and subsequent policy decisions designed to protect citizens in different countries today?&rsquo; Concepts from the fields of ethics, medical history, epidemiology, epistemology, and art will be central to readings, films and discussions focused addressing this core question.

And is this issue still relevant to our interpretation and use of the scientific method? Because of the great wealth of scientific results obtained in the Hellenistic period of ancient Greece, the course will take up such questions starting from that period. We will analyze the works of Euclid and Archimedes and others in Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, and Geography, with a particular focus on very modern, and maybe still undiscovered, contents. The achievements of Hellenistic science and the issues it raised will be compared with some of those appearing in other golden ages of science, such as ancient Babylonia, the Islamic Golden Age, the Renaissance, and our times. The course will not consist of a review of established facts, but rather the exploration of sometimes controversial interpretations.

This course explores this core question by considering disease as a product of complex intersections between the natural and social worlds and local and global forces. Topics to be discussed include: malaria, agriculture, drainage, and war in the Tigris-Euphrates marshlands; respiratory and sexually transmitted diseases, trade, pilgrimage, and quarantine in Hormuz, Mecca, and Dubai; hunger, offerings, and therapeutics in Persian shrines, mosques, and hospitals; pesticides, food production, diabetes, and the kidney market in India and the UAE; infertility, Islam, assisted reproduction, and medical tourism in Egypt and the Gulf states; and oil, migrant labor, Gulf sovereign funds, and the WHO polio eradication campaign. Readings come from history, anthropology, sociology, and literature.

COREP-AD 01 A Thousand and One Nights                                             For centuries The 1001 Nights (or Arabian Nights) has served as a point of encounter between Middle Eastern literary traditions and the cultural politics of Western literary and artistic production and translation. This course examines the much-debated history of the Nights and the cross-cultural exchange that has seen the tales adapted for distinct audiences in medieval Egypt and Syria, modern Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.

Jewish, Christian, Zoroastrian, Muslim and &lsquo;pagan&rsquo; realms co-exist uneasily in the original cycle of tales that often confront their protagonists with such differences as a problem. Even the possession of supernatural powers recurs in the tales in the form of an accusation made against perceived outsiders (the Maghrebi magician, the Jewish professional, the Sapphic witch). The reception of the Nights tales in Europe, Marina Warner contends in Stranger Magic, animated the new sciences of anthropology and psychology, suggesting alternative modes of modernity less strictly beholden to Enlightenment reason. Cultural difference peaked the interest of the translators who brought the Nights to Europe and pioneered travelogues and ethnographies of the Levant, Egypt and Arabia. Their writings would serve as points of departure for seminal works on the engagement with cultural difference and its representation, Appiah&rsquo;s Cosmopolitanism and Said&rsquo;s Orientalism. Texts studied include Galland&rsquo;s history of the coffee trade, folktales, histories, travelogues, ethnographies, polemics, and literary and cinematic retellings.

COREP-AD 02 Discovery and Recognition in Narrative, Film, and Drama                                             Across all cultures, stories are fashioned to withhold information at first, holding our attention through suspense. They then produce disclosures at crucial moments of denouement. For Aristotle, this dynamic movement from ignorance to knowledge is essential, especially when it takes the form of the discovery&mdash;or recognition&mdash;of previously unknown identity. Tracing an arc from the ancient world to the present day, students study how the epistemology of modern storytelling across cultures disturbs the familiar patterns of clear and comforting revelation associated with classic genres. Readings include: Aristotle&rsquo;s Poetics; Oedipus Rex; the Odyssey; the Old Testament; the Gospels of Mark and John; the Qur&rsquo;an; the Arabian Nights; Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear; Naguib Mahfouz; and films from the 1940s to the present.

COREP-AD 03W Journeys                                             The search for knowledge has been linked historically to the traveler&rsquo;s experience of new places and peoples. Travel necessitates the creation of translations that reveal how knowledge of otherness necessarily involves comparison to home and self. Drawing on texts that represent travel in realistic, figurative, and fantastic terms, we explore the idea that a journey entails the discovery, not only of a destination, but also of the self.

Growing scientific evidence of catastrophic&mdash;and anthropogenic&mdash; climate change brings new urgency to an old question: how do we humans conceive of our relationship to &ldquo;nature&rdquo;? This course explores how imaginative writers have situated the human in relation to Earth&rsquo;s many landscapes, plants, climates, and species. How have they depicted meaningful encounters between humans and the other animals? What have they suggested about humans&rsquo; responsibilities to the countless other living beings with whom we share this planet?

COREP-AD 10 Imagined Cities                                             This course examines the ways in which writers have responded to the social complexity of urban life and the difficult task of finding points of connection within the diversity of the city. How do writers narrate both the order and the disorder of urban space? What intellectual frameworks do they call upon to find meaning in unfamiliar settings? How do these assumptions shape what is seen and unseen within the city? And most importantly, what do these city texts reveal about the potential for building new forms of belonging and community within the urban environment? Readings will include philosophical works from ancient Greece, travel accounts of the medieval and early modern world, and fiction from writers such as Zola, Woolf, Mahfouz, Conrad and Pamuk.

Business has its rules and contracts. How do people understand the laws that are as much a part of life as the weather? Literature&mdash;the work of the imagination&mdash;guides our great journey towards understanding. Writers dramatize the relations among law, justice, and freedom. Writers also show the effect of law on the fates, fortunes, and feelings of people. The course explores the power of literature to show us what the law is, what it should not be, and what it might be.

COREP-AD 14 Cosmopolitan Imagination                                             Originating in the idea of the world citizen and conceived in contradistinction to nationalism, cosmopolitanism can be understood as a perspective that regards human difference as an opportunity to be embraced rather than a problem to be solved. Does this perspective lie behind all &quot;great&quot; literature, which asks its readers to experience otherness by opening themselves up to another person&#39;s words and thoughts? This course uses novels, poems, plays, and films to explore the cosmopolitan impulses behind the literary imagination.

COREP-AD 15 Tragedy                                             Tragic drama originated in ancient Greece and it has been central to both the aesthetic and the philosophical traditions of the West. At the same time, many classic works of Western tragic drama have been adapted by cultures all over the world for their own ends. This course examines key works of Greek and Shakespearean tragedy, critical, historical, and philosophical reflections on these works, and versions of some of these works from non-Western cultures, especially in film.

COREP-AD 17 Technophilia and Its Discontents                                             Why must Luke Skywalker turn off his in computer at the climactic moment of George Lucas&rsquo;s iconic film Star Wars (1977)? Star Wars is celebrated in part because it started a revolution in cinematic special-effects, but underlying the film&rsquo;s narrative logic is a deeply rooted anxiety about the right uses of technology. If man, as Hannah Arendt famously put it, is homo faber , the &ldquo;creator,&rdquo; the tool-making animal, then from at least Plato to the present, human beings have been telling stories about how to use tools correctly and about how dangerous they can be. This course investigates the ways philosophical writing, novels, plays, and films have dramatized the vexed relationship between human beings and the technologies they create. What is at stake in the creation of tools and technologies? Why are human beings, perhaps now at the start of the twenty-first century more than ever, sp enamored with technological progress? Why is technophilia , the love of technology, so often accompanied by its opposite, technophobia , the fear of technology? What do the attitudes represented in the texts and films we are reading tell us about the dynamics of human agency and about the relationship between science and religion? Texts and films come from a variety of world cultures and include Alif the Unseen , Arabian Nights , Blade Runner , Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? , The Caves of Steel, Metropolis , Paradise Lost , Phaedrus , R.U.R. (Rossum&rsquo;s Universal Robots) , and Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

COREP-AD 19W Myth, Magic, and Representations of Childhood                                             This course is fueled by two related questions: how have cultural ideas of &ldquo;childhood&rdquo; changed over time, and how have ancient tales of myth and magic found expression in cultures around the world? Almost every culture in the world has some tradition that includes mythical or magical tales; very often these tales include the exploits of a youthful protagonist. What can these tales, and their evolution&mdash;and transmission&mdash;over time and place, reveal to us about our own cultural preoccupations, as well as the cultures where these tales were originally produced? Through an examination of materials including graphic novels, fairy tales, movies, and fiction, we will consider the ways in which representations of childhood reveal ideas about power, politics, and the relationship between the self and society. Readings may include excerpts from The Arabian Nights ; Grimm&rsquo;s fairy tales; various Harry Potter novels; films from Hiyao Miyazaki, Disney, and Pixar, among others.

COREP-AD 20 Speculative Fiction                                             This course uses texts and films to explore the speculative impulse behind narrative. Through the analysis of science fiction, utopian and dystopian narratives, texts from political theory, and even works considered to be &ldquo;realist&rdquo; in their orientation, students consider the ways in which works of fiction present their readers with thought experiments that pose different kinds of &ldquo;what if&rdquo; questions. Is it possible to conceive of speculative fiction as, in fact, the type of all fiction?    *Note: This course is no longer being offered.

The course studies the representation of families&mdash;both biological and symbolic&mdash;as a source of blessings and burdens, bonding and betrayal in literary texts from around the world, starting with the Odyssey and moving on through the Middle Ages to modern writing. The course also investigates modern theories of the family as found in the works of such thinkers as Engels, Freud, and Foucault.

COREP-AD 22 Changing Notions of Race in Literature                                             This course examines a wide variety of literary texts on black-white couples, interracial families, and biracial identity, from classical antiquity to the present. Works studied include romances, novellas, plays, novels, short stories, poems, and non-fiction, as well as some films and examples from the visual arts. Topics for discussion range from interracial genealogies to racial &ldquo;passing,&rdquo; from representations of racial difference to alternative plot resolutions, and from religious and political to legal and scientific contexts for the changing understanding of &ldquo;race.&rdquo;                                                                      Spring 1 2012 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                   Werner Sollors                                           -             UW, 9:55-12:35                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 1 2014 ;             7 Weeks                                                                                                   Werner Sollors                                           -             TR, 10:00-12:30 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREP-AD 23 Doubles and Masks                                             Among the more significant activities of human beings is that of giving shape to fears and desires through art. All cultures participate in this form of emotional exteriorization, including creating &ldquo;doubles&rdquo; and &ldquo;masks&rdquo; through myths, literature, and other media. Concentrating on doubles and masks in several different cultures, we will chart the meaning and impact of the archetypal masked figures of the commedia dell&rsquo;arte in French and British theatre; the obsessive concern with the grotesque (the monstrous mask) in French romanticism and in Haitian magical realism; zombification, carnival figures, and ghostly doubles in Latin American, North American, and African cultural forms. We build a repertory of approaches to interpreting and uncovering the many layers of masking and doubling by reading in anthropology, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, and literary theory.

COREP-AD 24W Contagion                                             How do we respond to news that some among us are ill, and that the illness is, perhaps, contagious? Are the healthy ethically obliged to tend to the sick? What are the relationships between contagious disease and verbal communication: rumors, medical information, stories about the dying and the dead? How has illness literally and metaphorically participated in the reimagination of community, kinship, and sexuality in different times and places? This course examines the intersections of contagious disorder and storytelling in a range of cultures, settings, and forms, from ancient Greece to contemporary South Africa, from the Black Death, influenza, and AIDS to the proliferation of zombies and vampires in global popular culture today.

How do we fashion meaning in history and interpret other civilizations? This course looks for answers to these questions in the first great histories of the known world, Herodotus&rsquo;s Histories and Sima Qian&rsquo;s Records of the Historian . Addressing world history from the vantage point of ancient Greece and Ancient China, these works gave narrative an unprecedented geographical scope and acquired a textual authority previously enjoyed only by epics and chronicles. They also yielded model accounts of cultural difference that have influenced other narrative forms in fiction and non-fiction, textual and visual culture - to this day. In addition to Herodotus and Sima Qian, readings include selections from Homer and early Chinese chronicles, as well as contemporary historical fiction (such as Gore Vidal&rsquo;s Creation ), the films Hero and The Emperor and the Assassin , and journalist Ryszard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski&#39;s memoir and travelogue Travels with Herodotus .

COREP-AD 26 Oceans                                             Oceans spell motion. They have transformed human destiny since the beginning of time. They are rolling spaces of experimentation and exchange, hope and heartbreak, where peoples&rsquo; engagement with each other has unfolded, where humans have tussled with nature and interpreted the divine. Human interactions with oceans have spurred trade, set the boundaries of nations, built empires, redistributed populations, redefined tastes in food, produced new forms of art and music, transmitted diseases, and triggered new ideas and innovations in politics, law, science and technology. Above all, oceans continue to carry &ndash; and all too often thwart &ndash; the dreams of becoming and belonging of humans on the move. This course will explore the ways in which literary works across many genres &ndash; novels, plays, and poetry &ndash; have portrayed human relationships with oceans. It will prompt you to ask: how has the ocean functioned as a metaphor for the individual&rsquo;s connection with nature and society? In what ways do depictions of oceans commemorate or comment upon a panoply of human experiences through time? What affect and emotions do they encode? What identities do they create?

COREP-AD 28 Enchantment                                             The advent of the novel marked a break with a magical way of thinking. &ldquo;A magic curtain, woven of legends, hung before the world,&rdquo; writes Milan Kundera, &ldquo;Cervantes sent Don Quixote journeying and tore the curtain.&rdquo; Is enchantment possible after modernity? And if so, what form might it take? A reenchantment as foreseen by religious cosmography, in which the human realm intersectswith that of jinn or other supernatural beings? Or might the discoveries and technologies of the modern world, including the laws of physics and breakthroughs in science, themselves be conceived as enchanting? This course looks at attempts from various cultural vantage points to reconcile magicand realism in the aftermath of secularism and modernity. Must enchantment survive only as an escape from reason? Or might it be compatiblewith the Enlightenment and scientific inquiry? We will look at responses to the riddle of magic in modern society in the art, theatre, film and fiction of Europe, the Americas, and the Middle East.    *Note: this course is unlikely to be available to students who have already completed LITCW-AD 120 Magic Realism                                                                       Spring 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Paulo Lemos Horta                                           -             TR, 9:55-11:10 AM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Paulo Lemos Horta                                           -             MW, 12:45-2:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREP-AD 30 Mortal and Immortal Questions                                             We will read a wide-ranging selection of works from different cultures and chronological periods that have framed in memorable, though often contradictory, ways some basic questions about what it means to be a human being faced with death. We will examine the attitudes and actions of characters struggling to understand the meaning of death and who must decide whether they believe that death is an evil that harms them or is something they should just ignore. We will also consider the ways in which their views about immortality affect their actions and whether a desire for immortality has beneficial or detrimental affects on their lives and the lives of people around them. More generally, we will be looking at some of the ways that different authors and cultures treat the question of how significant one&rsquo;s death is to the continuing existence of others and what it means in different times and places to say that someone has died. Readings will include Euripides, Plato, Lucretius, Kyokai, Boccaccio, Flaubert, Tolstoy, Marquez, Morrison, Barnes, Salih, Hariharan, and Kanafani.

COREP-AD 31 Nation and Narration                                             The nation is as much cultural concept as political ideology. The formulation &lsquo;nation and narration&rsquo; envisages both the construction of the nation as narration and the imaginings of the nation in narrative (historical and literary). To capture a sense of the wide-ranging connections between nation and narration we track, through a variety of texts across cultures, periods and genres, the spread of the idea of the modern nation from Europe to the rest of the world; the struggles of anti-colonial nationalisms; the birth of postcolonial nation-states; their subsequent trials and tribulations; the rhetoric of nationalism; the critiques of nationalism; the voices of minorities, immigrants and indigenous peoples that disrupt a homogeneous &lsquo;national culture&rsquo;; the phenomena of transnationalism and globalization; and their implications for the future of the nation-state. Readings and films to be studied include: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Half of a Yellow Sun ; Assia Djebar, Fantasia, an Algerian Cavalcade ; Dave Eggers, What is the What ; D.W. Griffith, Birth of the Nation ; Michael Ondaatje, English Patient ; Salman Rushdie, Midnight&rsquo;s Children ; William Shakespeare, King Henry ; and Rabindranath Tagore, Home and the World .

COREP-AD 32 Stigma                                             Societies develop cultural behaviors that indicate the relative value of its members. Social acceptance has been historically dependent on its mutually constitutive term&mdash;ostracism&mdash;as members act on how they perceive and maintain their status in relationship to others. In this class, we will read novels, memoirs and plays that examine and deconstruct how systems of social worth operate, and how the nuances of those systems create and enforce devalued categories of people. Readings focus on works that consider the specific attributes that adhere to the historically stigmatized categories of illness and disability. We will discover how stigma affects feelings of self-worth and mediates engagement with others. Sociologist Erving Goffman observed that stigma creates &ldquo;spoiled identities.&rdquo; Using ideas offered in Goffman&rsquo;s seminal text on stigma, anthropologist Mary Douglas&rsquo;s work on pollution and taboo, our readings will focus on authors who deconstruct experiences of stigma, and who write in order to destabilize, revise, and repair the personal and social damage stigmatizing categories and behaviors inflict.

COREP-AD 33 Quest for Knowledge                                             Humanity&rsquo;s need to make sense of itself and its place in the universe has generated the world&rsquo;s oldest creation stories and its most enduring myths. The quest for knowledge has itself also been a perennial theme of world literature. This course examines the impulse to construct knowledge in a variety of time periods and cultural traditions, raising questions about how human communities around the world have conceived of the nature, conditions, limits, and means of acquiring knowledge. Readings include ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian myths, The Epic of Gilgamesh (Mesopotamia) , The Bhagavad Gita (India) , Plato&rsquo;s &ldquo;Allegory of the Cave&rdquo; (Greece), Farid ud-Din Attar&rsquo;s The Conference of the Birds (Persia) , Murasaki Shikibu&rsquo;s The Tale of Genji (Japan), Cao Xueqin&rsquo;s Dream of the Red Chamber (China), Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dora&rdquo; (Austria), Alberto Mussa&rsquo;s The Riddle of Qaf (Brazil), and short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle (Britain), Jorge Luis Borges (Argentina), and Naguib Mahfouz (Egypt).

COREP-AD 34 Autobiography: Ideas of the Self in a Global World                                             Storytelling is a way for humans to understand the world and their position in it. This is particularly true for those who write to tell their own life stories. In this course, we will explore how these self-narratives allow their authors to comprehend their position in a globally connected world. We will read autobiographies by public figures and private citizens from different traditions and time periods who travel away from home and then write about their experience. Readings include Augustine&rsquo;s Confessions (4th century), Al-Ghazali&rsquo;s Deliverance from Error (11th century), Margery Kempe&rsquo;s memoirs (15th century), Catalina de Erauso&rsquo;s Memoirs of a Basque Lieutenant Nun (17th century), Jean-Jacques Rousseau&rsquo;s Confessions (18th century), Olaudah Equiano&rsquo;s Interesting Narrative (18th century), N.O.

COREP-AD 35 Exile, Diaspora, and Migration                                             Diaspora has also been a recurring feature of human history since the dispersal of Jews from the Middle East, of Africans during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, or of the Irish during the Great Hunger. In the past two centuries, millions have migrated from their homelands to work or find refuge in far-away countries with cultures very different from their own. How do human beings come to terms with such conditions and transformations in their lives? What are the cultural, emotional, and intellectual effects of being exiled from your place of birth? How far can loss be compensated for by the idea that something can also be gained? In this course we consider connections and differences between experiences of exile, diaspora, and migration by examining stories and writing about them in the Bible, the Odyssey , and texts by Plutarch, Ovid, Dante, Byron, Dostoevsky, Conrad, C&eacute;saire, Naipaul, Rhys, Lamming, Carpentier, Darwish, Edward Said, Julia Alvarez and Kiran Desai.

Seemingly heedless of cultural norms, these characters in their many different guises point to the important role of play and disruption in the making of culture. In this course, students will consider rogues, outlaws, and outsiders of various types from around the world and their portrayal in stories, novels, dramas, songs, and films. Building a repertoire of trickster characters, types, and tropes, students examine how these characters&rsquo; dynamic roles relate to central problems of art, creativity, and life.

COREP-AD 38 Money and the Good Life                                             This course examines a variety of cultural conceptions of money and wealth, and the ethical questions that money or wealth allows a writer to probe. Is the value of men measured by the value of their money, or are there other criteria for wealth? Is someone&rsquo;s wealth possible without someone else&rsquo;s poverty? How is human ambition rewarded or punished in the &ldquo;pecuniary culture&rdquo;? The course looks for answers to these and other questions in key works of literature, sociology, economics and other fields, reading classical texts ranging from Aristophanes' Plutus, Ihara Saikaku's \"A dose of what the doctor never orders,\" and William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, to Honor&eacute; de Balzac's P&egrave;re Goriot, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby. Readings will be supplemented by excerpts from works by Ibn Khaldun, Adam Smith, Thorstein Veblen, Max Weber, and Alfred Hirshman.

COREP-AD 39 Bodies in Pain: Literary Representations of Disease and Health                                             As the Arabic saying goes, &ldquo;Health is a crown worn by the healthy and seen only by the ill.&rdquo; Throughout history, literature has staged the human struggle with disease and the related search for a cure. This course depicts the literary representation of pathologies and their medical treatments, ranging from eighteenth-century European treatises on the &ldquo;English Malady&rdquo; to the depiction of tuberculosis and leprosy in twentieth-century Japan. In the attempt to restore health, the relationship between patient and doctor is of central importance and therefore constitutes a thematic focus for this course. Readings will include: George Cheyne&rsquo;s The English Malady, Franz Kafka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Country Doctor,&rdquo; Thomas Mann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Death in Venice,&rdquo; Yahya Hakki&rsquo;s Lamp of Umm Hashim, Bernard Pomerance&rsquo;s The Elephant Man, Albert Camus&rsquo; The Plague, Sigmund Freud&rsquo;s Dora, Charlotte Perkins Gilman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yellow Wallpaper,&rdquo; Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s &ldquo;Indian Camp,&rdquo; Gail Tsukiyama&rsquo;s The Samurai&rsquo;s Garden, and Sanjay Gupta&rsquo;s Monday Mornings.

COREP-AD 41 The Soul                                             The theme of this class will be the discovery and exploration of the concept of the soul in the religious and philosophic traditions of the Mediterranean. We will focus on the great questions about the soul--the conscious self and its identity-- persisting up to and perhaps beyond death: What is it to be a person in a body? Is there something that is our essential self, independent of the body? Is this something conscious? Does it include the mind? Does it survive death? How exactly? Will it be judged, as Plato and Socrates thought and many religions suggest? We will explore these ideas from the Greeks through the Christians and Muslims, reading Homer, Plato, Augustine and Ibn Sina. The class will conclude with a glimpse at the late Renaissance, when the permanence and even presence of human souls became more uncertain, more threatened by death and obliteration, than in the ancient and medieval worlds. In this way, the Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now find our way, whether to faith--or away from it.

COREP-AD 42 Animals                                             Mankind&rsquo;s relationship to animals has always been ambivalent. Animals have been deified and demonised, petted and abused, cherished and exploited. While modern science is increasingly blurring the supposed demarcation line between animals (equalling nature) and humans (equalling reason), literature has allowed for transgressions that have worked both ways: transformations go from human to animal and vice versa. Not only this; throughout history animals have been thought to possess human qualities (and also: vice versa) such as speech and reason and have been represented to act in a way that often seems more human than the way humans behave. The class starts with the earliest literary document of mankind, The Epic of Gilgamesh, looks at texts from Antiquity and the Middle Ages from various civilisations (Aesopus, The Jataka Tales, The Panchatantra, Apuleius, Lucian, The Physiologus, The Journey to the West) and up to modern times (Darwin, Carroll, Kipling, Kafka, Dick) and also one film which especially reflects upon the strained relationship to an animal and man&rsquo;s self-perception in the face of nature (Moby Dick).

COREP-AD 43W Knowledge and Doubt                                             We will explore the relation of knowledge and doubt in a wide variety of texts in different genres, historical periods, and cultural contexts. Some our questions will be about sources of knowledge and evidence, while others will be about the nature of our capacities for knowing things. Questions include: what sources of knowledge can we trust, if any? Are there ways to achieve knowledge by transcending our normal sensory and rational capacities? Might we be systematically deceived about the world and, if so, could we still find happiness in such a condition? Is our knowledge inevitably dependent on others or are our best sources of knowledge found within? How can our knowledge be distorted by strong emotions such as hatred or love? Readings will be from Mo-Tzu, Sophocles, Nagarjuna, Ibn Tufayl, Dante, Montaigne, Cervantes, Descartes, Hume, Rousseau, and Proust.

COREP-AD 44 Laughter                                             Laughter is an essential part of the human experience. Why do we laugh, and what does it mean? How does laughter function within us as individuals, in our local circles, and as a global community? What evokes laughter that transcends culture, and what is culturally specific? In this course students will confront laughter and its capacity to disarm, connect, heal, teach, debunk, humiliate, reform, confront, expose, progress, politicize, humanize, and empower.

COREP-AD 45 Narrative and (Un)knowing                                             The fundamental question we will probe in this course is how narratives represent our coming to know. Ever since the Enlightenment, the West typically assumes knowing to be the achievement of a rational subject moving progressively through lawful space and time&mdash;and figuring things out. Only a lawful world allows the questing subject to arrive at knowledge and self-knowledge. This progressive story serves as a central target of modernist and postcolonial critique. Writers such as Kierkegaard, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Kafka, Freud, Faulkner, and Beckett call into question the narrative of the knowing Western subject. Garcia-Marquez&rsquo;s postcolonial One Hundred Years of Solitude simply dispenses with Western priorities of knowing and self-knowledge.

COREP-AD 46W Extinction                                             Scientists believe that our planet is experiencing its sixth mass extinction (the fifth, caused by a meteor collision, occurred 65 million years ago). Many even have called for the recognition of a new epoch, the Anthropocene, to mark the massive impact of human activities and human-induced extinctions on its biosphere. But how do we make sense of this era&rsquo;s accelerating rate of species death? What is the relationship between the extinction of a species and the extinction of cultures, languages, and lifeways? How have biodiversity loss, language death, the vanishing of &ldquo;savage races&rdquo; and aboriginal populations, genocide, and the specter of self-extinction shaped our understanding of what it means to be human? This course examines the human encounter with biotic, cultural, and metaphorical extinctions in a variety of genres, from Darwin&rsquo;s reflections aboard the Beagle to the preservation of Ishi (&ldquo;the last wild Indian),&rdquo; and from flood narratives to apocalyptic fantasies.

COREP-AD 47 Dreams                                             Dreaming is a trait that human beings share with a lot of other mammals. It was, however, not until Freud&rsquo;s insights into the subjective nature of dreams and especially neuroscience&rsquo;s explorations of the material basis of dreams and their cognitive function, that dreams were considered to belong in the realm of metaphysics. Thus, they served supernatural powers as a vehicle for prophecy and premonition. Literature has made use of these specific qualities in order to reflect on the dreaming persons&rsquo; ethical motivations, impulses to act, finding their identity, being deluded or informed and changing their ways. The class spans texts and one film (Kubrick) that represent dreams, either literally or metaphorically, from Antiquity (Cicero) to the present day (Borges) and across a variety of civilisations.

COREP-AD 48 Humans Deformed and Transformed                                             All cultures attempt to define what it is to be human. In the process, all cultures ponder individuals who do not fit definitions of the human&mdash;individuals who fall short or soar above their peers by commingling human with nonhuman ways and forms of being. Werewolves, wild men, fox women, and bird people test human nature against other natures. Sometimes these creatures find human nature lacking, and supplement the lack by reaching out into other natures; other times their transformations stage confrontations between civilization and chaos. We will survey how poets and narrative artists have imagined the commingling of humanity and non-humanity across several centuries and cultures. What are the attractions of getting beyond, or sinking below, the limits of the human? How do cultures set those limits? What resources does literature offer for thinking about self-definition in relation to social responsibility?

COREP-AD 49 Migration                                             There are more migrants worldwide today than Brazil has inhabitants. China, India, and the Philippines are sending most migrants; the most important host areas are Europe and the United States; and expats make up more than 60% of the total population in Qatar and the UAE. How has migration been represented in and shaped by literature and art? This course reviews exemplary texts, striking images, and important films. Focus is on the United States from around 1880 to World War II and on Europe in the second half of the twentieth century, then opening up toward students&rsquo; examination of cultural work by and about contemporary migrants from around the world. Readings include autobiography, reportage, documentary photography and film as well as fiction and creative visual work. Among the topics for discussion are metaphors and theories of migration (from uprooting and bird-of-passage to expatriate and melting-pot); labor arrangements; scenes of departure, voyage, and arrival; vibrant migrant communities and migrant alienation and pain; negotiation between places of origin and of arrival.

COREP-AD 50 Slavery and Freedom                                             This course draws upon literature, folk tales, films, and paintings to connect and compare the ways in which slavery has been imagined, experienced, narrated, and contested in different parts of the world from antiquity to the present. We will start by charting cross-cultural debates over &ldquo;slave&rdquo; and &ldquo;citizen&rdquo; through the ages, before proceeding to explore texts and images that positioned the &ldquo;slave&rdquo; as subject, and used literacy as a mode of resistance. How did these narratives define &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and shape international abolitionist publics? How might we read them for evidence of slave culture and community, and imaginaries of race, gender, and nation? How do novels and films serve as sites of public memory --or amnesia -- about slavery? What do they tell us about the threshold between history and literature? How does historical context serve to explain fiction? How do novelists and artists both use and challenge the archives to imagine &ldquo;agency&rdquo; in ways that official history writing does not accommodate? Course materials may be drawn from the works of Aristotle, Manu, Kautilya, Bartolom&eacute; de las Casas, George Fitzhugh, Olaudah Equiano, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Toni Morrison, Caryl Phillips, Amitav Ghosh, Rayda Jacob, and Abdurazak Gurnah, as well as the Uncle Remus Tales, and paintings and excerpts from the films Gone with the Wind, Amistad, Beloved, Twelve Years a Slave, Ceddo, Razia Sultan, Rue Cases N&egrave;gres, and Quilombo.

COREP-AD 51 Utopias &amp; Dystopias                                             We all think about wanting to live in the perfect world, but what happens when definitions of &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; conflict with one another? In this Pathways of World Literature course, we will explore the ways that writers and artists have wrestled with the question of &ldquo;utopia&rdquo; and, more particularly, the ways in which utopias always seem to fall short of their ideal. As we examine these failed utopias, we will consider the ways in which these texts explore the increasingly fraught relationship between humanity and technology, and between the community and the individual. Drawing on written and cinematic texts from around the world, this course will consider whether any attempt at utopia is doomed, given the human proclivity for violence and xenophobia. We will also consider why, in recent years, dystopian worlds have become the mainstay of pop culture, from novels to video games and movies. The course may include contemporary work by Hiyao Miyazaki, Chan Koonchung, and Vladimir Sorokin, as well as such classics as Thomas More&rsquo;s Utopia , Charlotte Perkins Gilman&rsquo;s Herland , and Fritz Lang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metropolis.&rdquo;                                                                       Summer 2015                                                                                          Deborah Williams                                           -             UMTWR, 10:00 -12:00 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

COREP-AD 52 Reading the Earth                                              This course introduces students to a wide variety of perspectives on the way that nature and its relation to human agency has been conceived from the industrial revolution onwards. As we face dramatic climate changes and the specter of wholesale annihilation, understanding our conceptions of and relation to nature becomes more pressing. Can we repair the rifts between humans and nature caused by industrialization? How have technological innovations affected attitudes toward the environment? The course will be constructed around a series of discrete problems, including today&rsquo;s most pressing eco-critical dilemmas, that will be contextualized historically through a variety of primary and secondary readings. Readings will include works by Gaskell, Williams, Zola, Stifter, De Tocqueville, Marx, Tekin, Munif, Tolstoy, Sepulveda, Carson and others.

COREP-AD 53 Disability                                             This course considers disability as a cultural concept that describes how human variation matters in the world. How has disability have been understood over time and across cultures? How have disabled bodies been represented and classified? How does disability intersect with other identity formations such as race, class, and gender? Ultimately, we will ask: what new forms of representation might bodily difference produce? Alongside texts that may describe disability as defective or tragic, we will trace other literary possibilities for bodies and minds that resist normative structures, from narratives that theorize ideas of access, cure, and care to fictions that reclaim disability as enlivening identity. Readings for the course range across drama, poetry, novels, essays, and films, including Sophocles, Philoctetes; J.M. Coetzee, Waiting for the Barbarians; Kazuo Ishiguro, Never Let Me Go; William Shakespeare&rsquo;s King Lear; David B., Epileptic; Kaite O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Peeling; Doris Baizley and Victoria Ann Lewis, P.H.*reaks; Octavia Butler, &ldquo;Speech Sounds&rdquo; and more.

COREP-AD 54 Pilgrimage and Enlightenment                                             For much of human history, the West meant India, the source of Buddhism, and a destination for pilgrims in search of enlightenment. This course examines the relationship between pilgrimage and enlightenment. Is pilgrimage a metaphor of a life well lived, or must it be a literal journey in search of a higher state of being? Is the purpose of pilgrimage to reach a destination, or is the journey itself, wherever it leads, more important? When is pilgrimage an individual affair, and when are more communal aspects essential to the journey. We begin our journey in India with Ashvagosha&#39;s Life of the Buddha, and then follow a trail of religious cultural production &ndash; including sutras, mandalas, and records of individual pilgrims &ndash; that culminates in the Chinese literary masterpiece, Journey to the West. The course then turns to &quot;Non Eastern&quot; adaptations of Journey, including Maxine Hong Kingston&#39;s Tripmaster Monkey and such films as The Lost Empire, before closing with comparisons of Buddhist pilgrimage with the Hajj, as well as &ldquo;modern Western&rdquo; journeys to Asia in search of spiritual alternatives to material civilization.

COREP-AD 58 (Dis)placements                                             One of the most significant developments in cultural and literary studies in recent times has been the focus on migration and displacement. The study of globalization further emphasizes detachment from the material world and privileges movement over locale. Consequently this emphasis on migration tends to position mobility and rootedness as opposite poles, often celebrating the former and neglecting or even devaluing the latter. The question is how a sense of place can persist in the face of all this movement and interaction. This course will consist of theoretical and fictional texts which make a case for revisiting the question of a global sense of place. How does the experience of displacement or contact with the outside change our relation to place? Is there a reaction to place that transcends nostalgia for lost origins? If displacement is valued over placement do the experiences of men predominate? The theoretical and fictional readings will center on the shaping force of place in human experience and the primacy of setting and landscape in narratives.

COREP-AD 60 On Violence                                  The ethics of violence, its articulation and resistance, violence as a social problem and violence as social necessity: from the epic, to the novel, to contemporary poetry, literature has been attempting to reckon with the question of violence. This includes violence in the form of divine retribution, to violence as part of the rhetoric of patriarchy, to violence as necessary for anticolonial nationalism. We will consider this both as a theoretical problem as well an aesthetic one. In other words, we will consider the work of philosophers and theorists wrestling with ethical and political implications of violence, while also considering how literary texts drawn from a diverse geographic and historical corpus have attempted to &#39;write&#39; violence as a problem of artistic representation. Some of the texts we may consider include: Euripides&#39; Medea, the epic Mahabharata, Dante&#39;s Inferno, Dostoevsky&#39;s Crime and Punishment, Sorel&#39;s Reflections on Violence, Gandhi&#39;s Hind Swaraj, Simone Weil&#39;s Essay on Force, Franz Fanon&#39;s The Wretched of the Earth, and the poetry of Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Dennis Brutus.

COREP-AD 61 Cultural Memory and Resistance                                             As the Atlantic slave trade forcibly dispersed Africans throughout Europe and the Americas over four centuries, cultural memory became a key component of survival for those who journeyed through the Middle Passage. How did languages incorporate modes of expression &ndash;creole, patois, pidgin&mdash;that connected with scarce-remembered cosmologies and ways of being to allow for resistance to systems of oppression? And how was the traditional music of African peoples reconstructed with new instruments and inflections during this process? We will examine texts ranging from Plato, the Book of Exodus, Ibn Battuta, The Tale of Sundiata , early African slave narratives, the music of the Fisk Jubilee Singers, Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, works by Amiri Baraka, Aim&eacute; C&eacute;saire, Edouard Glissant, Wole Soyinka, Mos Def, Common, Nubian Sisters, Saul Williams, Talib Kweli, Tupac Shakur, and in films such as Sugar Cane Alley , La Haine , Illmatic and Belle to better understand key components of cultural memory and resistance.

Often the call for tolerance is grounded in relativism&mdash;the thought that there isn&rsquo;t a fact of the matter. After all, on what basis could we insist that others share our beliefs if those beliefs are subjective, a function of upbringing or our peculiar tastes and concerns? But should we accept relativism? Can relativism justify tolerance? If not, then how can we justify tolerance?                        This course is writing intensive .

The first reviews theories that place factors of production such as labor and technology as the main cause of cross-country differences in economic wealth. The second part of the course investigates the role of institutions, culture, religion, geography, and luck as deeper causes of comparative development. The main questions addressed throughout the course are: Why are there such large differences in income per capita across countries? Why have some countries developed steadily over the past 200 years while many others have not? Why do some governments adopt policies that promote economic development while others set up barriers to economic activity? These questions are analyzed from a theoretical and empirical perspective.

CORES-AD 05a Relationship of Government and Religion                                                        This course examines the relationship between government and religion. To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: \"Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.   This course extends over two semesters and both CORES-AD 05a and CORES-AD 05b must be completed to secure credit for the course.

To this end, the course concentrates on the interpretation, meaning, application, and wisdom of 16 words from the American Constitution: \"Government shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" These 16 words serve as a starting point for the course because they broadly prohibit government entanglement with religion while simultaneously bestowing government with the responsibility to protect religious freedom. The primary texts of the course are the opinions of the United States Supreme Court, the highest Court in the United States, and final authority on interpretations of the Constitution. Prior knowledge of the subject matter or the United States is not a prerequisite for this class. This course is conducted over two semesters.   Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the political theory field.

We examine how animals are socially or culturally constructed in &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;modern&rdquo; societies, and consider proposals for studying animals as minded social actors.

CORES-AD 10 What is Man?                                             The human sciences, born of the Enlightenment&rsquo;s quest to recreate Man in its image, gave rise to a paradox. In brokering reconfigurations of the essence and boundaries of the human, new models for socio-political organization, and claims to inalienable human rights, they also demarcated and fortified the supposedly &lsquo;natural&rsquo; fault lines between sexes, races, cultures, and peoples. The course provides an interdisciplinary exploration of the nature of cultural distinction and the historical development of the Image of Man in a variety of global case studies, from the eighteenth century to the present.

In this course we trace the history of the relationship of religion and science in Christendom and Islamdom from the Middle Ages to the present day, drawing on primary sources and secondary readings from religious studies, the history of science, and anthropology.

CORES-AD 12 Love, God, and Politics                                             The course grapples with love, a blind spot in social theory, and its relation with religion, transcendence, sacrifice, and faith. On the one hand, sexuality and gender have become objects of intense concern, politicized by religious movements around the world from the fundamentalist Christians in America to Islamists and pietists in the Islamic world. On the other hand, for large numbers of young people in the Western world not only has sexuality become increasingly unhinged from love, but love has become a troubling category, something uncertain and dangerous to believe in. This course examines the relation between love, sex, and religion as they reverberate in both the private and public spheres.

We begin with a historical survey, from the \"traditional\" families that once dominated throughout the world, to the \"modern\" (industrial) and \"post-modern\" (post-industrial) family values that appear today. Then we focus on particular aspects of family life: childhood; dating and courtship; sex and reproduction; husband-wife relations; old age; female-headed and other non-traditional families.

CORES-AD 14 Self-Representation                                             There are many different ways in which human beings represent themselves. I represent myself as a living being, as belonging to a given society and culture, as having a given character, and so on. But do I have a representation of myself as the author of those representations? Exploring this question casts light on central questions of philosophy, for instance the relation between mind and body, the relation between self and other, or the belief that we have freedom of the will. Readings may include selections from Western philosophy and Buddhist philosophy as well as neuroscience, psychology, psychoanalysis, and literary works.

They are spaces for deliberation and collective action. This class explores the reasons why most humans now live in cities, why cities rise and decline, and how they become sites and stakes of political protest. We start by examining the politics of urban development in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and by analyzing three urban protests, in early 1990s Riyadh, in Cairo during the Egyptian revolution, and in New York City during the Occupy Wall Street movement. We then explore the concomitant processes of city making and politicization as analyzed by Plato, Ibn Khaldun, Hegel, Engels, Marx, Weber, Freud, and Simmel. The last part of the course is dedicated to interdisciplinary urban studies, from urban anthropology to the history of urban planning and to subaltern urbanism. In-class sessions are complemented by field visits to Abu Dhabi and Dubai.                       This course is writing intensive .

Yet what we mean by family or by kinship changes dramatically across societies and through time. This course introduces social scientific approaches to and methods for understanding and analyzing this diversity; it therefore asks students to explore the relationship between the universal and what is specific to particular societies and cultures.

CORES-AD 21 Gender and Globalization                                             What does gender as category of analysis indicate? How does gender intersect with other axes of identity such as class, nation, and ethnicity in a globalized world? The course introduces students to select women&rsquo;s issues (e.g. employment, political participation, reproductive rights and healthcare, feminism vs. multiculturalism, gender based violence, and peace building) that have emerged in the global context and the international debates that surround them. In addition, the course looks at the relevance of women&rsquo;s representation to address barriers to gender equality in the &lsquo;democratic process&rsquo; as well as the shortcomings of democratic mechanisms to achieve women&rsquo;s rights and some proposed solutions to these limitations.

Moreover, &ldquo;culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; are often held to be at odds with one another; if modernity can be defined by its claim to universal applicability, then culture(s) mark the disjunctures and discrepancies that repeatedly disrupt this narrative. This course examines the (cross-) cultural politics and imaginaries of &ldquo;modernity&rdquo; to ask: What does it mean to be modern in the global present?

CORES-AD 23 Financial Systems as Social Forms                                             Financial systems direct flows of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. This course compares the theories implicit in the U.S. and UAE financial systems and describes how they work in practice. Whereas credit and interest are central to U.S. banking, Shari&rsquo;ah law forbids interest, so Islamic banking uses profit- and loss-sharing to organize investment. By comparing these two systems, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in a global context.

CORES-AD 24W Landscapes of Memory                                             This course explores the ways in which urban landscapes have traditionally served as fragile repositories for collective memory from the first monuments of Near Eastern civilizations to the modern architecture of contemporary global cities. Some cities seek to preserve their pasts, while others aggressively brush aside older forms and structures to make way for the new. Students examine the &ldquo;politics&rdquo; of urban memory, exploring historical and contemporary debates about the conflicting demands of preservation and modernization in a variety of cities from around the world.

CORES-AD 25 Gift and Exchange                                                        Gift giving occurs in all cultures. A gift can be a material object or money, but it can also be an act of kindness or love. A gift is free but it can also come with the expectation that it will be matched by a return gift. Gift giving is therefore part of a complex structure of economic and social exchange. This course considers gift giving from the perspectives of anthropology, history, and the arts; it explores gift exchange through ethnographies as well as texts on market economies and art, gender, death, altruism, risk, and the impacts of colonialism on traditional exchange societies. Readings will include seminal works on gift exchange by Marcel Mauss, Bronislaw Malinowski, Franz Boas, and others.

CORES-AD 26 Legitimacy                                             What are the foundations of political legitimacy and to what extent do governments abide by them? In this course, we will explore these questions using both classical and contemporary accounts. The first half of the course focuses on political systems in Ancient Greece, Rome, Medieval Europe, and Early Modern Europe through the lens of great thinkers, including Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Montesquieu, Burke, Weber, and Marx, as well as a series of primary source documents. We then proceed to the &ldquo;post-1789&rdquo; world and discuss legitimacy in the context of democratic government. Topics covered include the role of legislators, issue representation, descriptive vs. substantive governance, and the ongoing debate between advocates of majoritarianism and those of proportionalism.

It explores questions of peace and justice, nonviolence, the idea of a &ldquo;just war,&rdquo; as well as notions of peace in international relations, economics, and psychology, examining how those spurred peace activism and the ideology of pacifism. To that end, students analyze literary, visual, and organizational representations of peace across national and cultural boundaries and the emergence of peace and conflict studies as an academic discipline. Readings include works by Laotse, Thucydides, St. Francis of Assisi, Immanuel Kant, Henry David Thoreau, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., A.J.

CORES-AD 29W Property                                             The institution of property describes one of the fundamental relationships between people: the relationship between people as it pertains to things. In this seminar, we explore how understandings of property have been influenced by cultural and ethical norms in different civilizations; how property rights have evolved with technological progress and changes in the demands of the environment; how property is affected by and influences the sphere of individual freedom, the relation between the individual and the state, and the organization of productive activity. As examples, we will look at property in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome; consider the views on property expressed in Christianity and Islam as well as the role that changing views on property played in the Declaration of Independence, the French Revolution, and the Russian Revolution. We will use our insights to debate contemporary issues in property rights of interest to seminar participants. These might include intellectual property rights, rights to genetic material, inheritance, airwaves, financial regulation, the rights of indigenous tribes of the Amazon rainforest, claims on the Arctic, or the trade-off between rights to privacy and freedom of the press.

CORES-AD 34J Polarization                                             Polarization has been a feature of societies around the world since the inception of human civilization. To this day, individuals routinely sort themselves in to groups based on share political, social, religious, or cultural beliefs. In turn, these sorted groups often find themselves at polar extremes from one another, something that has often led to intense, and sometimes violent, conflict. In this course, we will explore the history, emergence, and pervasiveness of various kinds of polarization: ethnic, linguistic, religious, political, and geographic. We will begin the course by defining polarization and looking at examples of it from antiquity to the present. Thereafter, we will look at the consequences of polarization for politics, social interactions, and economics. The course will be taught using classical works by kings and statesmen (e.g., Constantine of Rome, Louis XIV of France, Woodrow Wilson), as well as contemporary scholarship from a diverse group of scholars: historians, demographers, political scientists, biologists, and economists. Special attention will be given to social media and social networking, a pervasive aspect of contemporary social polarization; it will serve as the basis for a course-long project. Prerequisites: None; some familiarity with social networking (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn) and Microsoft Excel would be useful, but not required.   * Please note the duration of this course during summer 2013 is 26 May-12 June.

CORES-AD 35 Hard Choices                                             Life is rife with hard choices. Should you become a doctor or a lawyer? How much should you sacrifice in order to help others? Should you marry and have children? This course examines the phenomenon of hard choices by focusing on two questions: (1) what makes a choice hard? and (2) what should/does one do when faced with a hard choice? We explore answers to these questions from a variety of perspectives &ndash; philosophical, religious, literary, psychological, and neuroscientific.

CORES-AD 36 Ideas of the Sacred                                             The question of God(s) pertains to the existence, manifestations, meaning, and attributes of the sacred. Although conceptions about the sacred are inevitably shaped by history and culture, the fundamental question of God(s) has had an enduring presence throughout human experience. This course takes up this perennial human question from the context of some of the world&rsquo;s major religious traditions including Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Taoism. What similarities do these great traditions share, and how does their understanding of the sacred differ? Additionally, the course explores the relation between reason and faith. How does the empirical verification characteristic of an increasingly pervasive scientific and technological worldview impact on belief in God(s)? Readings for the course are drawn from a variety of disciplines with a focus on primary sources and seminal works.

CORES-AD 37W Slavery and Freedom in Comparative Perspective                                             This course examines slavery in historical and comparative perspective by focusing on Greek and Roman slavery, African and Islamic slavery, and slavery in the American South, Brazil, and the Caribbean. We will examine the nature and centrality of the institution of slavery, the difference between societies in which slavery existed and those which can be thought of as &ldquo;slave societies, &ldquo; asking such questions as how did enslavement occur and who were the people enslaved and in what ways were did they differ from non-slaves? What &ldquo;rights&rdquo; or standing in the law if any did slaves possess? What was the nature and extent of the master&rsquo;s power over their slaves? What were the social, economic and political functions of slavery? These are important questions for understanding slavery. But the study of slavery inevitably involves broader, more fundamental issues concerning freedom, personhood, social inclusion and belonging. As Orlando Patterson put it in the most far-reaching study of slavery, Slavery and Social Death, &ldquo;the idea of freedom and the concept of property were both intimately bound up with the rise of slavery, their very antithesis. Once we understand the dynamics of slavery, we immediately realize why there is nothing in the least anomalous about the fact that an Aristotle or a Jefferson owned slaves.\"                      This course is writing intensive .

This course poses the fundamental questions: &ldquo;What is law?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What is a legal system?; and &ldquo;What is the rule of law?&rdquo; Appreciating that law reflects different cultural and historical facts, the course employs a comparative methodology in order to explore the fundamental questions from the perspective of various legal traditions. This comparative methodology considers jurisprudence from African, Chinese, Hindu, Marxist, Islamic, Southeast Asian, and Western legal traditions. In relation to these diverse legal traditions, the course examines the topics of natural law, legal positivism, interpretivism, legal realism, justice, human rights, critical legal studies, feminist jurisprudence, critical race theory, and post-modernist jurisprudence.

CORES-AD 39W Revolutions and Social Change                                             Revolutions, i.e. the rapid, massive and often violent change in the political and economic arrangements of society, mark the modern epoch starting with England in the 1640s, America in 1776, and France in 1789. Revolutions obviously continue today. But what are revolution&rsquo;s causes, typical course and consequences? Why such passion and energy? A systematic comparison of different revolutions informed by both the classical and contemporary theories of revolution might offer a few startling insights.

CORES-AD 40 Corruption                                             Political corruption exists everywhere, but which countries are most corrupt? Do highly corrupt countries have common characteristics? How much corruption is there? The social costs of political corruption, from stealing public funds to paying bribes to avoid basic safety and healthy regulations, are often extremely high. Why are most attempts to fight corruption unsuccessful? The course is comparative and historical, and as far as possible requires no background knowledge.

CORES-AD 42 Economics of Everyday Life                                             There is the economics of economists, highfalutin and opaque theoretical models, and then there is economic activity as we experience it in our everyday lives and settings. Between the two stands a wall of incomprehension. From work to love, from social networks to family life, consumption, money, witchcraft, slavery, digital economies, slums, and ghettos, these spheres of everyday life ask us hard questions about the nature of the economic realities we inhabit. This course will seek to explore the everyday life of economic experience in a way that can capture its richness, diversity, and complexity. To that end, we will be drawing on a range of sources, from classical philosophy, to journalism, sociology, anthropology, manga, film, history, literature and even economics in search of a few answers.

CORES-AD 43 Ideology                                             What is an ideology? How do a series of sometimes disparate beliefs about issues come together to form an ideology? How do ideologies change and reform over time? In this course, we explore these fundamental questions about beliefs in societies across the globe. We begin by defining ideologies and looking at examples from key intellectual movements of the last millennium (e.g., crusaderism/jihadism, liberalism, communism, fascism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism). In this intellectual journey, we read some of the great thinkers who have shaped the concept of ideology over time, including Robespierre, Burke, Jefferson, Marx, Lenin, Mosca, and (Benedict) Anderson. Thereafter, we look at how to measure ideologies. Students are introduced to quantitative tools for assessing ideologies from both individual-level surveys, voting behavior, and text (e.g., speeches and Twitter). In the last part of the course, we examine how shifting ideologies beliefs have (or might have) consequences for a wide range of human phenomena, ranging from interpersonal interactions to elections and international conflict.

Searching for what anthropologist Mary Douglas called &ldquo;an anthropology of consumption,&rdquo; we will look across history and places, to pre-modern Japan, Renaissance England, the contemporary UAE and North America. We ask about the politics of things and their shifting roles in everyday life. What is the nature of taste? of shopping? How do shifts occur depending on object, place, and time? We will explore the logistics of fashion, the link between goods and geography, production systems, and distribution through retail markets. We stretch theoretically across the political economy of Marx, neo-classical economics, and the more recent cultural-social schemas of Bruno Latour and Howard Becker. For a final project students will focus on a specific object that they research and present to class, based on readings, discussions and original research.

CORES-AD 45 Language and Thought                                             The course is about the nature of language, of thought, and of the relation between them. Among the questions to be asked are: Are there such things as meanings , and if so, what sorts of things are they? How do the meanings of linguistic expressions depend on the speech acts the expressions are used to perform? Is linguistic representation to be explained in terms of mental representation? Vice versa? Or is neither to be explained in terms of the other? How from a finite stock of words is it possible for a language to construct an infinite number of sentences, each with its own meaning? How is it possible for a child to acquire&mdash;in just a few years and without any instruction&mdash;the ability to understand indefinitely many sentences never previously encountered by herself or anyone else? In grappling with these and other questions we will study work in philosophy, theoretical linguistics and cognitive psychology.

CORES-AD 46 Global Population                                             Population is a basic parameter of the society. The size, composition, and distribution of a population may change over time. This course sets out to understand the causes and consequences of population change across the globe, and engage the students in ongoing debates over population policies. Population change takes shape by births, deaths, and migration. These fundamental population processes are influenced by institutions of marriage, education, health care, and the economy. Population change may lead to different cultural phenomena and individual behaviors and varying levels of economic development. It may also have implications for the distribution of human welfare, which may in turn elicit perception of injustice and even political action. We will engage the interdisciplinary scholarship on global population, and contemplate issues faced by different countries. We will emphasize general principles that help us understand global population change, and try to come up with policy solutions to related issues.

CORES-AD 48 Subjectivity                                             Human beings differ from machines, and perhaps also from other animals, in the way we encounter the world&mdash;always from a first-personal perspective, an awareness of oneself in the world and not merely of the world. But what exactly is this peculiarly distinctive way of experiencing the world? What is the essence of our subjectivity? Can it be explained by neuroscience, by finding some particular function of the brain? Has it been better represented in the humanities, in explorations of what is called &ldquo;the human condition&rdquo;? Or perhaps the philosophers, who in every age and culture have reflected on the nature of the self more than any single other topic, have had something important to say. We will study important ancient thinkers from Buddhist, Hindu, Islamic, Greek and Jaina intellectual cultures, and look critically at their appeal to metaphors of light, of mirrors, and of interior spaces; at expressions of contemporary subjectivity in modern novelists and film-makers including Fernando Pessoa and Andrei Tarkovskiy; and at dissenters from Vasubandhu to Simone Weil, who have said that subjectivity is merely an illusion&mdash;or, worse, a deceit.

CORES-AD 49 The Great Divergence                                             In 1500 the economic, social, and political differences between Europe and Asia were small. By the twentieth century, the gaps were enormous. How can we explain this Great Divergence between Europe and Asia? The course will discuss the classical answers to this question given by Weber, Smith, Marx, and Malthus. Has modern research confirmed or contradicted their views? The roles of demography, politics, law, globalization, social structure, science, and technology will be discussed as well as the interconnections between them. The course aims to expose the methods that social scientists and historians use to answer grand questions of social evolution, so that the approaches can be compared, contrasted, and assessed.

CORES-AD 50 Emotions                                             Emotions have been understood since Antiquity to stand at the heart of human motivation and agency, as well as to influence diverse facets of the human condition, from family formation, empathy, and socialization, to choice-making, aggression, and war. Despite this acknowledged ubiquity, emotions were often treated with suspicion as untamable impulses and animalistic drives, threatening reason, morality, gender identity, or social and political equilibrium. This course explores the evolving forms of emotional experience and expression in a variety of global case studies. By investigating diverse interplays of definition and practice of emotions in philosophical and religious systems, medical, pedagogical, and social-engineering projects, and the collusion of emotional and political regimes, it further interrogates the status of emotions as universal constants, beyond determinants of time, space, and cultural context. Course readings include works by Homer, Aristotle, Dharmak\u012brti, Ibn Sina, Abelard and Heloise, Shigesuke, Descartes, Spinoza, Campe, Darwin, and Freud, as well as relevant secondary scholarship.

CORES-AD 51 Shame and Guilt                                             We will read and discuss works of major writers to explore the role that the moral emotions, shame and guilt, have played and still play, in our individual and collective lives. We will ask whether these two emotive forces are parallel or antagonistic in their effects on our behavior. We will apply the concepts of shame and guilt to the understanding of psychology and moral value systems, and of different patterns of culture and politics. We will attempt to understand how shame and guilt can both serve adaptive (life-supporting) as well as maladaptive (life-destroying) functions. Finally, we will ask whether developing the capacity to love can enable us to transcend the destructive outcomes that both shame and guilt, and the ethical systems they motivate, can generate. Authors studied will include Homer, Sophocles, the Bible, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Freud, Ruth Benedict, Pierre Bourdieu, Salman Rushdie and Kanan Makiya.

It will particularly consider various attempts to say what the &lsquo;aim&rsquo; or &lsquo;meaning&rsquo; of life might be. Readings will be from a range of sources, philosophical, scientific, and literary. We begin with biological life (how to distinguish living from non-living entities; the &ldquo;units&rdquo; and &ldquo;levels&rdquo; of life). We then turn to a more &ldquo;biographical&rdquo; notion of life, applying especially to human lives. (Is there a natural or typical structure to &ldquo;a life&rdquo;? Is the unity of a life a matter of degree, and what does it depend on? Is narration the best way to describe or understand a life? ) Finally we turn to the value of life and lives. (Does all life have value, and by virtue of what? Does each human life have absolute value, or is it legitimate to compare and rank the values of different lives?) Readings will include works or extracts by Aristotle, Euripides, Whitman, Darwin, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Sartre, as well as religious texts such as The Bhagavad-Gita, the Diamond Sutra, and the Tao Te Ching.

CORES-AD 53J What is a Religion?                                             Course description: Most English-speaking people can answer the question, &ldquo;What is your religion?&rdquo; &hellip; even if the answer is &ldquo;I am an atheist, so I don&rsquo;t have one.&rdquo; Yet the things we call religions are remarkably diverse. They differ, for example, in whether they address one God, no gods or many; how important they think explicit creeds are; how much attention they give to prayer, fasting and other rituals; and whether adherents are expected to dress or eat or engage in other everyday practices in a distinctive way. In this course we&rsquo;ll discuss the views of a variety of anthropologists, philosophers and sociologists as to what religions are; theories that seek to explain not just what, if anything, these many diverse religions have in common but the moral, social or cognitive purposes they serve. Among our theorists will be some of the founders of modern Western social science&mdash;E. B. Tylor, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim.

CORES-AD 54J Surveillance and Privacy                                             This multidisciplinary course examines the historical, sociological, cultural, and political significance of surveillance, with a particular focus on the relationship between surveillance and privacy. Drawing on a wide range of sources (&shy;including academic research, historical documents, literature, film, and social media), the course explores how developments in the practice and technologies of surveillance have shaped the ways in which we think about privacy, identity, and personal information over the last 3000 years. Among the central questions that animate the course are: What is the relationship between surveillance and governance? How has the emergence of various forms of electronic surveillance changed the ways in which we think about identity and individual privacy? How do we balance a concern for individual freedom with the pursuit of security in a world characterized by increasingly sophisticated and intrusive forms of state and private surveillance? The course will also focus on key historical debates about the appropriate limits of surveillance, paying particular attention to the ways in which certain major events (such as the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States) have shaped how we think about surveillance and its relationship to privacy, security, and democracy.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

CORES-AD 55 Labor                                             How has labor - and our attitude towards it - evolved from subsistence farming and slavery? What happened in the industrial revolution and which changes are brought about in the new digital age? What role have institutions and religions played in attitudes toward labor? How does education affect work/life satisfaction, wages, and mobility? Why do so many people choose not to work &ldquo;in the market&rdquo;, and at the same time, why in happiness surveys is job loss often ranked similar in severity to the death of a close relative or divorce? These are some of the questions we will discuss in this class when we study how the role of and attitude towards labor has changed.

This class will explore human, natural and political boundaries as processes accompanying genetic, linguistic, religious and cultural divergence. It will also investigate changing boundaries over time in various regions to see how these changes explain both socioeconomic and political outcomes today. Students will be exposed to various interdisciplinary literature, and will learn to create their own digital maps using both archival and contemporary resources. They will also work with these novel data to present their own research ideas.

CORES-AD 58 Randomness                                             Does randomness actually exist, or is it a human theoretical construction? How does our understanding of randomness condition our ability to make sense of the world? This course will explore the role of randomness in human experience and agency, probing how our understanding of chance affects how we produce meaning and knowledge. We start by looking at how early cultures thought about and reacted to randomness and also consider later efforts to reify uncertainty with mathematics. Then, we will examine how scientists and artists manipulate chance in their work, and build on those efforts using interactive simulations and course projects.

CORES-AD 60 Colonialism and Post-Colonialism                                             Until very recently much of the world has lived under colonial rule. Major colonial powers shaped social, religious, and institutional life in countries that they controlled. This course explores the legacies of colonial rule. Do some colonial-era institutions and practices tend to persist into the present, while others are likely to disappear? What are the conditions under which persistence of institutions and practices is more likely? What does such persistence mean for the social, political, and economic well-being of former colonies today? We engage with these and related questions through the prism of related literatures in political science, economics, and history. First, we explore the motivations of colonizing powers and their methods. We then consider the colonial experience from the perspective of populations being colonized. Most of the course is dedicated to exploring the impact of colonial institutions and practices on contemporary levels of development, inequality, and conflict in the former colonies.

CORES-AD 62 Money                                             The need to trade goods and services within and across time is a requirement for the basic functioning of any society. When barter systems do not satisfy needs, the ability to engage in such trades requires a peculiar sort of good, namely, money. In this course we begin with the theory of money, why one uses either barter, commodity or fiat monies, and the functions money serves. We trace the history of the development of money and credit across societies to the present day. We explore the centrality of money to various cultures and its representation in the arts. We discuss governmental manipulation of aggregate monetary stocks to spur or dampen trade; or historically to finance conflict by debasing the value represented by this peculiar good. We explore a central truth, that while modern money is intrinsically meaningless, its role in facilitating economic growth in the supply of real goods and services is surprisingly robust, provided policy does not deliver problems when too much money and credit is in circulation.

CORES-AD 64 Justice in Theory and Practice                                              This course invites students to engage with historical and contemporary treatises about a universal concern: justice. To what extent are our social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know? In this course, we explore the ideal of a just society as understood across cultures, communities, and time &ndash; from the earliest recorded histories of the Arabian Peninsula, the Iranian Plateau, the Indian subcontinent, and the European continent to present day works. Through careful reading of primary texts, we consider what place the values of group integrity, liberty and equality occupy in conceptions of what constitutes a just society. We then apply these insights to inquiries into our own local communities and practices.

CORES-AD 68 Religion and Society                                             In this seminar, students explore the diverse and dynamic manifestations of religion in social life&mdash;as a personal and collective experience, an individual and group identity, and a code for moral behavior&mdash;and examine how these social uses of religion impact various spheres of society. After considering classic social theories of religion, we will look at substantive cases from the United States, Egypt, Iran, China, and Venezuela to investigate how and why religious meanings and identities come to matter (or not) in arenas of gender equality, political mobilization, nationstate structures, everyday intergroup interactions, and the law and punishment. Overall, this course aims to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and substantive background necessary to analyze the workings of religion and religious identity in modern societies.

His careful observations gave way to advances in microscopy that have allowed scientists to observe detailed structures of plants, viruses invading cells, intricate crystal lattices, and the seemingly chaotic motion of small particles. In this course, microscopy is explored, first by examining the fundamental optical systems used to magnify objects, and eventually by using sophisticated microscopes to make observations. We explore seven wonders of the invisible world&mdash; natural animate and inanimate phenomena that include micro-animals, plant and animal cells, bacteria and viruses, fungi, proteins and naturally occurring crystals.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

COREX-AD 43 Behavior                                             Why we behave in a certain way is one of the most fascinating and complex questions and one that we often cannot even explain to ourselves. So what drives behavior? How can behavior be measured? And can behavior be changed? This course will examine behavior from the viewpoints of biology, neuroscience, economics, psychology and philosophy. We will place an emphasis on interpreting and designing experiments that measure behavior in both humans and animals. We will discuss topics as diverse as memory, morality and altruism and examine how being part of small and large groups can affect decision-making and behavior.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

We will examine the origin of human diversity, how human diversity is measured and analyzed, and how our perception of diversity has changed through history. Emphasis will be placed on recent progress in genetics and evolution and how this progress affects our daily life and identity. Students will learn how genes can inform us about human history, ancestry and evolution. The laboratory component of the course will demonstrate how data are generated and analyzed, and will explore the difficulty encountered by scientists in inferring processes from observations and experiments. Students will have the option to collect and analyze genetic data from their own genome.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

COREX-AD 60 Observing the Universe                                             Observation is always the first step in the scientific process, usually followed by hypotheses and experimental tests. In astronomy, observation is nearly the only way to get data and test theories. For most of human history, astronomical observations were done using the human eye aided by simple instruments. The early telescopes were also aids to the human eye. It wasn&#39;t until photography was invented in the late 19th century that astronomy began to become independent of an individual observer&#39;s eyes. In this class, we will explore the development of our understanding of the Universe through the historical development of observational tools and techniques. We will start with the instruments of the ancients and progress to the modern era using data from today&#39;s most advanced observatories which are no longer limited to light our eyes can see. However, we are still limited almost exclusively to what the Universe chooses to show us through electromagnetic or other types of radiation, since even our deepest space probes have only barely left the solar system. This course will entail several observations at night.    *All COREI-EDNW courses have been replaced with COREX.

This course introduces students to the foundations of computer science. Students learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs using a high-level programming language. The course covers core programming concepts including basic computation; data structures; control structure; iterative structures; file input/output and exception handling; recursion, sorting, searching, and functions. Students also learn the elements of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), such as objects, classes, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and interface. OOP is a programming paradigm used to solve complex systems. Students produce programs focusing on scientific concepts, graphics, games, and web common gateway interface (CGI) implementation. Students design, test, and develop innovative software applications such as games, interactive websites, and other projects related to different fields. In a final project, they develop a fully functioning, interactive, fun game that employs a clean design, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), simple to moderate strategy, and event-handling techniques.

An algorithm is an effective procedure, expressed as a finite list of precisely defined instructions, for solving problems that arise in applications in any domain of knowledge. All computer programs are translations of algorithms into some programming language. Often the most difficult parts of designing an algorithm are to make sure that when it is programmed in a computer, it runs as fast as possible and does what it was designed to do. This course covers the foundations of the design and analysis of algorithms at an advanced level, focusing on proving the correctness of algorithms, analyzing their computational efficiency, and designing efficient algorithms. The algorithms studied are taken from a variety of applications such as robotics, artificial intelligence, heuristic search, pattern recognition, machine learning, music, bioinformatics, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry.    Prerequistes are CS-AD 103 and CS-AD 116. (CS-AD 103 can be taken as a co-requisite for this course.)    Note: Math-AD 131 has now been changed to CS-AD 116. Students who have already taken MATH-AD 131 have met the prerequiste.

The operating system in a computer is a collection of software functioning as the chief manager that oversees the interactions between the users and the applications, the software and the hardware, and is responsible for scheduling the many tasks involved in an efficient and user-friendly manner. This course covers high-level design of key operating system concepts such as process scheduling and synchronization; concurrency, deadlocks and their prevention; memory management, including (demand) paging and segmentation; and I/O and file systems. Students learn about the design and implementation of the operating systems that run on your personal computers and smartphones. This is a hands-on course where students implement (in C, C++, Java, or C#) operating system components like those found in Windows, UNIX/Linux, and Android.

It can be difficult to instruct by means of languages what we want a computer to do, and it can be easy to write programs that are incomprehensible or even incorrect, leading to disastrous consequences. An ideal computer language makes the difficult problem easy and the easy problem difficult. In this course the student are exposed to the four major categories of programming languages: imperative, object-oriented, functional, and logic languages. Specific languages are chosen for illustration. Topics to be covered include fundamental issues, lambda-calculus, type systems, scoping, concurrency, modularization, control flow, and semantics.

We all use this technology routinely to obtain information about almost anything in our daily lives. A database is a site that stores information or data in an organized way, together with supporting data structures and database languages that permit users to effect operations such as visualizing data, searching data, deleting old data, and inserting new data, in a secure way. In this course students learn the basic techniques for designing and managing databases useful in a variety of applications ranging from websites and banking systems, to video games.

Computer graphics deals with almost everything other than text and sound, and is therefore dominated by the visual aspects of computing. It is concerned with the design of algorithms, programs, graphics languages, graphics data structures, display devices, and systems for creating realistic images, and processing visual inputs such as photographs, drawings, movies, animations, or simulations.

This course teaches students the design and implementation of such Internet-scale networks and networked systems. Students learn about the principles and techniques used to construct large scale networks and systems. Topics include routing protocols, network congestion control, wireless networking, overlay networks and applications, network security, and peer-to-peer systems. Upon completing this course students are able to initiate and critique research ideas, implement their own working systems, and evaluate such systems. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation. The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. Examples are drawn primarily from the Internet.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth computer science capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

It focuses on individual economic decision-makers (households, business firms, and government agencies) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape our economic life. Applications of supply and demand analysis and the role of prices in a market system are explored. Students are also exposed to game theory, the theory of the competitive firm, the idea of market failure, and policy responses. The course relies on cases and examples, and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to shed light on modern economic principles and their application to solving the problems that face the global economy.

The course begins with a discussion of some basic data used to analyze the relationships between macroeconomic aggregates such as production, inflation, and unemployment. Next, determinants of long run growth in national per capita incomes are discussed followed by a discussion of economic booms and recessions. The course concludes with descriptions of the tensions inherent in the formulation of monetary and fiscal macroeconomic policies and the pitfalls and opportunities afforded to nations within the context of an emergent global economy.    *Students NYUNY: This course counts for Societies and Social Sciences (College Core) credit;

The second part of the course covers the role of money and finance in global economic activity. Topics include: the roles of the exchange rate; current and capital accounts as key variables in international economic relations; purchasing power parity and interest rate parity; the international effects of macro policy and government exchange rate policies; the role of oil exports in the world economy; and the role of international economic organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

We study the manner in which consumers, producers and resource owners, acting through markets, determine the prices and output of goods and the allocation of productive resources. Consumers and producers are viewed as agents with well-defined objectives, choosing optimally under constraints on their resources. The price mechanism is viewed as an institution that disseminates information to decision makers&mdash;firms and consumers&mdash;and coordinates their behavior. We will study circumstances under which markets promote an efficient allocation of resources, as well as sources of market failure where the price mechanism can lead to inefficient outcomes.

We contrast the European and American experiences. The course allows students to develop an analytical framework to understand the interactions of the housing market, the credit system, and the labor market.

Similarities and differences between the patterns that have occurred in many of the sub-Saharan economies and those of other countries and in other times will be discussed. Emphasis is given to the range of factors involved: history, politics, demographics, urban planning, climate change, and economics. Accra is a particularly interesting location for this course as Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to become independent following World War II, and its leadership was advised by one of the leading development economists, Nobel Prize winner Arthur Lewis, who gave considerable attention to the role of cities in the development process. The course also considers the important roles played by slavery, the structural adjustment programs, and the colonial urban planning policies drawing out their implications for Ghana&#39;s economic development and its urbanization. A number of site visits to other cities will be included.    Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Since the middle ages, however, it has been surpassed by Europe in economic performance. This course explores this reversal in fortune. Was it due to culture, religion, law, geography, agrarian structure, globalization, or state policy? What attempts have been made to catch up with the West? Which have been successful?

This class will study the various ways that workers and firms interact in labor markets. What factors determine how much labor individuals supply to the market? What determines labor demand by firms? How do firms design contracts to provide the right incentives to their workers? What determines wage inequality in the economy? What can insights from labor economics contribute to debates surrounding policies such as immigration reform, welfare reform, and income taxation? The class will expose students to the basic theoretical models used by economists to tackle these issues. We will also survey evidence from empirical studies on these topics.

In 1908 GDP per capita in Argentina was around 80% of GDP per capita in US, where GDP per capita is the value of production divided by the size of the population. One hundred years later, in 2008, GDP per capita in Argentina was around 35% of GDP per capita in US. In the course we aim to understand why the development of Argentina has been so disastrous focussing on economic factors. We will compare Argentina with other countries in order to gain insight into the crucial factors for economic growth and development. We will first study the history of Argentina with emphasis on its economic development. Next we will go into the mechanisms of growth by studying basic economic theory about supply and demand, production, consumer choice and growth. Using our knowledge about the history of Argentina and economics, we will try to understand some of the main causes of the actual economic development of Argentina. The insights we gain from studying the Argentinian experience will help us understand that economic growth and development are sensitive and delicate phenomena, not just for Argentina but for any country. The course includes excursions to see traces of earlier times and their current impact on Buenos Aires and its culture.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

ECON-AD 221 Understanding Financial Crises                                             The purpose of this course is to understand the key facts and basic mechanisms concerning financial crises and some related topics. The course will first lay down some foundations by studying empirical evidence about crises as well as the basic crisis mechanisms (bank runs, sovereign default decision, currency collapse). The empirical facts will provide a long run perspective on the recurrence of different types of financial crises (banking crises, currency crises, and sovereign debt crises), and will study their causes, their resolutions, and their long run consequences. The crisis mechanisms will be introduced through very simple canonical models, putting the emphasis on intuition and insight over model technicalities. Once the foundations are in place, the course will open up to a series of topics mixing themes &ndash; such as crises and long run growth; inequality and crises; crises, stabilization and reforms &ndash; and in-depth study of major crises episodes &ndash; such as the Great Depression, the US Financial Crises of 2007-2008 and the Euro Crisis.

This course revisits some of the most fundamental assumptions concerning human behavior in economics such as selfishness and individual rationality; discuss evidence illustrating systematic violations of them; and provide explanations for them. Further, it discusses some of the important implications of the new behavioral models for economic policy, finance, marketing, management, and industrial economics. Students will participate in classroom experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the issues at hand. The continuous interplay between economic theory and empirical data throughout the course means that this unit will appeal to anyone with an interest in understanding human behavior.

The course starts with a careful study of the functioning of markets, culminating with the first and second theorem of welfare economics. The next topics cover an introduction to strategic behavior and game theory, and subsequently a study of market failures situations in the case of adverse selection and moral hazard. This course involves more formal analysis than the one used in Intermediate Microeconomics.

Modeling the subtle mixture of strategic interactions across those &ldquo;coalitions&rdquo;, and equitable compromises within coalitions, is the difficult task of cooperative game theory. The course introduces the formal models of cooperative behavior, both from the normative viewpoint of sharing the benefits of cooperation, and the positive analysis of coalition formation. Applications include competitive markets, the provision of local public goods and the emergence of federations, cost sharing of joint ventures, routing games on networks, and more.

It emphasizes accounting as the process through which relevant financial information concerning an economic entity is recorded and communicated to different parties, such as stockholders, creditors, tax authorities, investors, etc. The underlying rationale of accounting principles is discussed, aiming to provide students with a clear understanding of accounting concepts. In this course students learn about the relevance and informativeness of financial statement for decision making, as resource allocation, evaluation and contracting activities. In addition to text-oriented materials, the classes also include cases so that students can discuss applications of basic concepts, actual financial reports, and articles from newspapers.

The course considers market failures; the evaluation of public expenditures; and the incidence, efficiency, and effects of various taxes. The primary purpose is to use economic tools (mainly microeconomic) to study the impact of government policy on the distribution of resources. Topics include: welfare economics; public goods and externalities; public choice; important issues of government expenditure, taxation, and activity (e.g., international public goods and institutions, tax competition and coordination, education, social security and health care); fiscal federalism (including European integration); and mechanisms of political influence (e.g. elections and lobbying).

The system has recently suffered two extraordinary shocks - the collapse of the mortgage finance market and the \"vicious downward cycle\" caused by linkages between bank and sovereign creditworthiness. These shocks, which have thrown the Euro-American economies into a protracted Great Recession, threaten the euro and the European Union, and represent great challenges to US and European governments, financial institutions and their regulators. The German government, based in Berlin is a key decision maker in the efforts to stabilize the euro, the weaker Eurozone member countries and the European banking system, and the European Central Bank, another key player, is not far away in Frankfurt. This course provides a broad ranging exploration of these issues for students with only general knowledge of finance and economics.

We examine these questions through the lens of history, exploring how these societies&mdash;and their schools&mdash;have changed across time. We place special emphasis upon education in the U.A.E., interspersing our classes with site visits to schools, state agencies, and non-governmental organizations. At the end of the course, we ask what other national school systems might learn from the U.A.E.&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, opportunity, and danger.

We explore international peacebuilding, including peacekeeping, institution building, and humanitarian aid. We examine how specific education initiatives such as peace education, education for democracy, Education for All, and citizenship education fit into these strategies. We also examine how education may be used to disrupt peacebuilding. Case studies may include Syria, Afghanistan, Israel/Palestine, Guatemala, UAE, and the United States. Guest speakers are invited from relevant organizations to speak about their responsibilities; students prepare questions to interview the guests.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Although policy makers often regard education as a means to promote greater equality and opportunity, empirical evidence suggests that more often than not, a child&rsquo;s background predicts how well they will perform in school and what types of employment opportunities will be available to them later in life. However, some nations do a better job than others in using education to expand opportunity. Understanding why some nations continue to have schools that struggle in their efforts to serve minorities and the poor children, and why other nations are experiencing greater success in this endeavor is the central aim of this course. We will also consider the ways in which teachers, students, parents and their allies, have used educational settings and the educational process as a focal point for resistance to social and cultural reproduction, and various forms of oppression and discrimination. The role of social identities related to class, race, language and ethnicity in shaping the experiences of students and teachers in the reproduction process, will be a primary focus of the course readings and class discussions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

In course readings and papers, we will examine how the meanings of &ldquo;nation&rdquo; in China shifted across the past century. We will also intersperse our classes with visits to schools and other educational sites, to study contemporary trends and dilemmas in the teaching of nationalism. At the end of the course, we will ask what other national school systems might learn from China&mdash;and vice versa&mdash;in a globalizing world of flux, danger, and opportunity.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Knowledge and understanding of static equilibrium is essential for future study of dynamics, robotics, fluid mechanics, astrodynamics, and vibrations. The methods, techniques, theory, and application of equilibrium in the solution of engineering problems are presented for two-dimensional systems. Students have the opportunity for extensive practice in applying these principles.

This course aims to introduce the students to these laws namely&mdash;the conservation of mass, conservation of force and linear momentum, conservation of torque and angular momentum, conservation of energy, conservation of chemical species, and conservation of charge&mdash;that are derived in integral forms. Selected case studies are used to demonstrate the application of these laws for the simplification of complex engineering problems. In addition, this course also helps the students develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of work and heat.

Students are first introduced to the historical significance of experimental discoveries, the importance of experimental design and measurement. Key examples are discussed. The importance of measurements, errors, uncertainty and its justification will be discussed in detail and students will learn how to estimate, use and report uncertainties.

Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.    The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context. The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of faculty and other professionals.    Capstone Seminar (ENGR-AD-400), Capstone Design Project I (ENGR-AD-401) and Capstone Design Project II (ENGR-AD-402) collectively offer the engineering capstone experience to seniors.

Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.    The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context. The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester.

Writing assignments include both critical analyses and creative exercises.

FILMM-AD 106 The Human Condition: From Script to Screen                                             Human behavior and our relationships form the basis of most narratives and our insatiable need for story. This course will explore human behavior in the context of evolutionary psychology, and develop that into a working screenplay. Readings and film screenings will focus on observing human behaviors and relationships. You will hopefully leave the class with a well-honed short script, anchored to a frank and honest look at our behaviors and relationships, and perhaps some greater questions and thoughts into the human condition.

Topics include theme, character, research, story, conflict, dialogue, and script editing. The course aims to make a connection between the ancient traditions of the oral storyteller and the professional practice of the contemporary screenwriter when pitching to producers. Screenings and discussions focus on classical and contemporary examples of the short film from a variety of genres, traditions, and cultures. All students complete two short screenplays.

FILMM-AD 116J Single Shot Cinema                                             In this hands-on course, we explore the vocabulary of camera movement and the dramatic impact of the long, single take. Single Shot Cinema is a film method that re-interprets film language based on the technical developments and possibilities of filmmaking in the digital age. What was once only possible with cranes and Steadicams is now accessible to the low-budget filmmaker. Students discover how to block actions and characters in a scene and how to choreograph one single shot, using smooth and flexible camera movements that expresses the drama, emotion, and vision of the director.

Through the universal language of lenses and lighting we learn how these play a central role when working with a set. Students develop the skills to use a motion picture camera in order to tell a good story. The class structure reflects a working film set with emphasis on production. Learning to create a mood advances the ultimate goal of a filmmaker. The heart of visual storytelling is composition: camera placement, camera angles, camera movement, and lens choice. Together with the lighting style a film finds its own unique life. In each class we look at selected scenes from popular films and recreate them. We shoot exercises in the classroom or on location.

First, we trace the origin and variations of New Wave films from European through Latin American to East Asian nations. Then, we expand the scope to transnational crossroads including pan-Chinese, Balkan, South Asian, and African regions. Finally, we explore how contemporary cinema reflects sociopolitical and cultural phenomena in the age of globalization. Major trends and directors are introduced with close analysis of key films.

After examining the philosophical underpinnings of the New Wave in philosophical existentialism (Sartre, de Beauvoir) and the movement&rsquo;s theoretical underpinnings in the film criticism of Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, we examine a chronological series of films by Cahiers directors (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rohmer), Left Bank directors (Resnais, Duras, Varda, Marker), and Cin&eacute;ma V&eacute;rit&eacute; (Rouch, Morin). While focusing on the films themselves, we also take a cultural studies approach by seeing the films as part of a broader artistic and mediatic spectrum.

Through the genres of experimental, narrative, and documentary image-making, this course examines the work of women who have pioneered and re-imagined the methods, theories and ideas of the dominant culture. An eclectic and multi-cultural selection of feature length films, shorts, exhibitions, books, and iconic images will be screened and studied. During the semester students will sub-mit written responses and critiques to the work presented. Weekly exercises will help develop the students critical reading, thinking, and writing skills. Students will look to their own cultural milieu to make a final image based project in conjunction with a written essay, and create oral/visual presentations. Field trips outside of class are mandatory.

We will study closely the film style of film directors whose work exemplifies different elements of film style: mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and the long take with static camera (Antonioni, Tsai, Tarr); editing in space, shot/reverse shot cutting, eye-line matches, and point-of-view editing (Hitchcock, Ozu); camera movement (Ophuls, Fellini, Tarkovsky); and sound/image montage (Lang, Bresson, Godard). Based on identical scripts, students (working in groups) will be assigned four practical film-based exercises modeled upon the films of these directors.

Combining close readings of the literary source-texts with close analysis of the films, the course will simultaneously explore the &ldquo;transtextuality&rdquo; theory that treats the complex and mutating relations between any single text and all the other texts, genres, media, and discourses with which it comes into dialogue. Through these contrapuntal analyses, the course will demonstrate the myriad ways that adaptation study can illuminate both media.

It also maps out historically significant films on three broadly thematic stages: mind, society, and culture.

From the Libyan War of 1911-1912 onwards, film has been integral to shaping public consciousness of military events as they unfold and public memory of wars after the guns have fallen silent. The course looks at feature films and non-fiction, with government and clandestine short films shown as well as commercial entertainment films and independent documentaries. Topics to be addressed include how war&rsquo;s many violences are represented; the filmmakers&rsquo; circumstances (censorship, political agendas and pressures, physical danger, the politics of funding); national cinemas; the role of sound; the camera as weapon; the uses of history; and the operation of memory. Case studies may include the two World Wars, civil wars (Spain, Lebanon), anti-colonial wars, the fall of Communism, the war in Iraq, Vietnam, the Israel-Palestinian conflict; and the Egyptian revolution.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The course explores how documentary and fiction are combined throughout history and in different cultures. We will examine the work of ten filmmakers who have merged both formats creating singular hybrid films. Dramatic reconstructions, manipulated imagery or fictional interstitials are frequently incorporated into documentaries to elevate realism. Conversely, fiction occasionally crosses over into documentary to create a sense of authenticity or truthfulness. Lastly, the division is sometimes completely eradicated making it difficult to distinguish the reality from the imaginary. Over the course of the semester, students will create their own docu-fiction short films. They will bring together fiction and non-fiction story elements reflecting on how each form complements the other.

How does it differ from world history? International history? Transnational history? And why has writing global histories become a new intellectual imperative for historians today? This gateway course for the history program provides students with skills to answer these questions. It challenges them to examine when categories like the nation and civilization enhance or inhibit historical understanding, and to consider alternative units of place and space for historical inquiry.

HIST-AD 118J World War I: A Case Study in the Causes and Consequences of War                                                                   The First World War was the seminal event of the 20th century. It left ten million soldiers and six million civilians dead. Under the strain of war and defeat, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire collapsed in revolution. Large portions of France lay in ruins and England&rsquo;s wealth shattered. The war set the stage for the disastrous events of the 20th century. In this course we will examine the broad background to the war: the roles of nationalism, colonialism, and militarism, and the consequences of the decline of the Ottoman Empire. We will analyze the immediate responses to the crisis of 1914, the judgments and misjudgments that started the conflict. We will examine war strategies, the costs and futility of its battles. By looking at diaries, letters, and contemporary writings, we will study its human impact. And we will study the larger outcomes of the war: changes in society, the revolutions, the peace settlements and their consequences.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 120 World War II in Global Perspective                                             The Second World War was the most destructive in human history and has become a touchstone for historical understanding in the postwar period. This course seeks to examine not only the strategic decisions of major belligerent states (Germany, the Soviet Union, Japan, Britain and the United States), but also the transformative power of the war in societies across the globe. Course topics will include the experience of soldiers and civilians, the mobilization of populations within far-flung empires, the use of new weapons and occupation strategies, and the critical social and political consequences of the war on populations across Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Middle East.

How, specifically, did Islam spread in relation to the extension and intensification of agriculture and trade? What diverse forms have Islamic ideas, institutions, practices, and subjectivities taken in this expansive world region? What, additionally, is the relationship between Indian Ocean Muslims&rsquo; beliefs and practices and those of the followers of other religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity? This course addresses these questions by engaging with cutting-edge scholarship from the fields of global, Indian Ocean, and Islamic history, as well as a wide variety of primary source materials. Throughout, students also probe the relationship between power and the production of knowledge about Islam.

Situated at the center of the Indian Ocean world, the Indian subcontinent is currently home to over a billion people, and is the site of richly interconnected histories with regions around the wider Indian Ocean, including the Gulf. The course explores these histories, with a focus on understanding major cultural, political, economic, and environmental connections and changes as they affected ordinary people (including migrant laborers) and shaped the nature of collective identities (ethnic, national, religious, caste, class, gender, regional, and linguistic) over time. In developing an understanding of how collective identities were produced historically, students ultimately acquire valuable tools for appraising and navigating competing models of nationalism, cosmopolitanism, and universalism in the wider Indian Ocean world today.

HIST-AD 130JX Islam in Africa                                                                                          Drawing on both secondary and primary sources, this course begins with an examination of the history of Islam in Africa, focusing primarily on developments in the western Sudan, al-Maghrib, and East Africa. Introduced by merchant activity in the eighth century CE, Islam by the fifteenth century had become the religion of ruling elites throughout much of the western Sudan and along the East African littoral, where it was the foundation for a celebrated urban development. A sustained period of Islamic reform ensued in the western Sudan from the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries, coterminous with the transatlantic slave trade, whose end arguably stimulated slaving activity across the Sahara and Indian Ocean (activity that long antedates that of the Atlantic). By means of these various trades and other mechanisms, many African Muslims were transported into the Americas as well as the Indian Ocean, and the course will follow their experiences as well as their legacies among African-descended populations, concluding with a consideration of their relationship, as well as that of Africa itself, to developments in the broader Muslim world up to the present day.    Note: At this time, it is expected that this course will be offered in Abu Dhabi. However, if circumstances change, it may be relocated to Accra. Decision will be made by October 15.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

HIST-AD 144 Topics in Asia-Pacific History: America&#39;s Wars                                                        Course topics may include: ancient China; the Mongols; food and drugs in Chinese history; Mao Zedong; history of Vietnam; Asian diasporas past and present; Japan in World War II; Pacific Rim history; and others.  America&#39;s Wars, Past and Present:  This is a course taught in wartime &ndash; however invisible -- about wars. We shall begin by considering the post-1945 wars of the 20th century and then move on to discuss the series of wars that have marked the 21st century. The history, political uses, memory and forgetting of the Korean and Vietnam Wars will be the subject of the first part of the course. The ongoing influence of those wars on contemporary politics will occupy the second part of the course. The way Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm) was fought and reported upon was shaped by the specific understanding the administration of George H.W. Bush had of the Vietnam War. The 2nd war in the Gulf (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and the war in Afghanistan were shaped by the outcome of the first Gulf War. But they were also fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies that were used by those who supported and those who opposed the war. The course will examine these analogies with some care. There are two connected questions: can history teach? What does it teach?    *Note: Topic: America&#39;s Wars is crosslisted with Indian Ocean World and Asia-PacificWorld.

We examine the role of food and drugs, especially opium, in Chinese social, cultural, economic, and political history, with an emphasis on the pre-modern period. Topics may include the relationship of health and diet; food in religious and ritual practice, gastronomy, consumption and the material culture of food and drugs, restaurants and catering; famine; imperial dining practices; tobacco smoking; opium smoking, cultivation, and elimination; the Opium Wars; and food, drugs, and identity, including the global association of China with food and with opium.

The goal of the course is to identify the best ways of asking and answering questions about the widespread environmental challenges that are seemingly inherent in China&rsquo;s economic development. Are the challenges new to Chinese history &ndash; particular to modernization &ndash; or are they rooted in long-standing patterns of land use and resource exploitation? How to do we square the history of damage wrought to nature with the equally salient history of &ldquo;Asian&rdquo; notions of &ldquo;living in harmony&rdquo; with nature, exemplified by philosophical Daoism and millennia of poetic and painting traditions extolling the beauty and wonder of nature? Who, moreover, is entitled to do what with and about the environment: what are the roles of the state?; of scientists and engineers?; of humanists? The course doubles as an introduction to the history of China, and to the multidisciplinary field of environmental studies.

This course looks closely at borderlands between China and other sovereign states, and borderlands between upland and lowland peoples in and around the region that some scholars call &ldquo;Zomia,&rdquo; the elevated parts of mainland Southeast Asia that often lie beyond the reach of governments based in lowland population centers. The course readings raise questions about indigeneity, migration, and state-building in what may be the most ethnically diverse part of the world. It tests the heuristic limits of key historical categories like nation, state, and citizenship, and further explores alternative notions of political and cultural community.

Beginning with recordings of oral tradition originating in the early empire of Mali to novels addressing the roles of African colonial intermediaries to music protesting apartheid in South Africa, students will engage with a variety of sources of cultural and artistic nature. The course will focus on historical developments such as the Atlantic and internal slave trades, the process of European colonization, religious practice, decolonization, genocide and migration, urbanization, and AIDS. We will also examine various themes, such as local and imposed notions of race and ethnicity, lived experiences of and Africans&rsquo; responses to colonialism on the continent, issues of gender and class, and political resistance. Our broad goal is to investigate to what extent long-term historical dynamics determine the present. Students will not only watch films, listen to music, and read literature, but also read reflections on the methods of using these sources as a way of studying the history of Africa. Course requirements provide students with a language and historical framework for understanding the dynamic history of the continent.

HIST-AD 164 Urbanism and Modernity: Paris, Istanbul, Berlin                                  This course explores the emergence of the &ldquo;modern city&rdquo; in three significant urban centers (Paris, Istanbul, Berlin) in relation to the demographic, economic, and political pressures of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Attention is given to the foundations of community, the changing uses of public space, the appearance of new strategies of urban planning, and the contested process of defining the &ldquo;modern&rdquo; within a specific local culture.

Which population groups arrived when, and with what political and cultural consequences for themselves and for other groups? How has public and private authority dealt with ethnic and racial diversity in the most conspicuous of the immigrant-receiving nations in the world, and one with egalitarian aspirations? What ideas about diversity and cosmopolitanism have developed in this American context?

HIST-AD 169 From the &quot;Chilean Road to Socialism&quot; to the Pinochet Era: Chile and the Global Cold War                                                         This course explores some of Latin America&rsquo;s most significant social and political events during the Cold War: the democratic election in 1970 of a Marxist president in Chile, his overthrow by a military coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat in 1973, and the installation of a military regime led by General Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1989. During this period, Chile attracted the world&rsquo;s attention for many different reasons. Among them was the experimental nature of its social and political transformations, namely a democratic transition to socialism, as well as the authoritarian implantation of neo-liberal policies.    This course seeks to understand both of these experiments, focusing on their global connections beyond the well-known diplomatic tensions of the Cold War. Along with an analysis of Chile&#39;s social structure, political system, and economic history, this course will highlight the importance of gender roles, subaltern agency, and popular movements. Finally, the course will also address the traumatic dimension of Chile&rsquo;s Cold War experience trough the study of violence, truth, and memory during Pinochet&rsquo;s regime.

It will begin with an overview of the Mongol empire and its legacies in Central Asia and the broader Muslim world. We will compare the emerging post-Mongol Eurasian and Ottoman states through the lenses of law, political legitimacy, succession, and ruling institutions. We will then compare Russian and Ottoman civilizing missions, imperial nationalisms, treatments of sectarianism and ethnic minorities, constitutionalisms, public health policies, responses to Islamic modernism, Marxist and other radical leftist ideas, and women&rsquo;s emancipation. The course will conclude by considering how post-imperial modernization projects transformed identity, gender, and religion in Central Asia and the Middle East.

What picture of the human being emerged with this turn? How did the turn toward the Classics contribute to the development of modern humanism? How was this humanism itself taken up in the Enlightenment and the development of modern education systems, and what remains of humanism today?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

JOUR-AD 114J Food in the Global Kitchen                                             Abu Dhabi contains many worlds, from five-star hotel restaurants to South Asian migrant workers eating on the job. This course uses food to explore the daily life of a global city in the Middle East. The course combines intensive reading and writing assignments with reporting and field trips. With Abu Dhabi as their beat, students explore the role of markets; traditional bedouin cuisine and the rituals of eating it; the hidden lives of food producers and growers; the cuisine of exile; the business of food; edible geography; and other topics drawing on anthropology, economics, culture, politics, and urban studies. Students participate in hands-on experiences like visits to local markets and restaurants. Each student are expected to find, report, and write a feature article about a food-related location in Abu Dhabi. Readings range from medieval Arabic culinary manuals and classics of cultural anthropology to contemporary food reporting and literature, with an emphasis on the Middle East.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 114J Punishment in Politics, Law and Society                                                                              This seminar investigates the state&rsquo;s power to punish. We read foundational works from philosophy, sociology, political science, and law to explore why states punish, how they punish, and whom they punish. We focus on the modern American approach to punishment, including its use of mass incarceration and the death penalty. We analyze U.S. Supreme Court cases in light of the fundamental purposes of punishment, and compare penal practices around the world.

Its subject matter is no longer limited to the &ldquo;foreign relations&rdquo; of nations. International law continues to deal with how states deal with one another. It includes, as it has for centuries, rules on when it is legal for states to go to war against each other as well as how war is conducted, for example. But international law today includes some rules about how a government is expected to behave toward its own citizens as well as towards foreign investors who establish businesses within its territory. It also includes rules that govern non-state actors, such as international organizations like the United Nations, and others that are used by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are devoted to particular causes, such as Amnesty International. Contemporary international law is found not only in the rules that states make with respect to one another (as under treaties). It is also found in some pronouncements made or some actions taken by international organizations and international courts, like the International Court of Justice or the International Criminal Court (both located in The Hague, the Netherlands).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LAW-AD 213 Climate Change Law and Policy                                             Climate change will be a foremost theme that will influence financial activities, and policy and legal framework for years to come. In a noticeably short time span, climate change has become a global challenge calling for collective action. Climate change law is emerging as a new legal discipline. Students in this course will explore how climate change law relates to other areas of law and how climate change has elicited rulemaking process at the international, regional, national and local levels. The course will encourage students to identify the climate change policy issues in state and international laws. Students will also study how international law and international relations influence current national laws and policies. The class will be invited to study the negotiation process, implementation and current status of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, the Copenhagen Accord, the Cancun and Durban Agreements. The class will then proceed to evaluate the various legal tools that are available at national and international level to address climate change, including cap-and-trade, carbon taxation, command-and-control regulation, litigation, securities disclosures, and voluntary actions. The class will also examine energy and climate change nexus and the roles of energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and carbon capture and sequestration. The course will pay special attention to the role of developing countries in the emerging international climate change regime and negotiation strategies of G77+China in Copenhagen, Cancun, Durban, Doha, Warsaw, and upcoming UNFCCC conference in Peru in December 2014.

The changing nature and media of contemporary globalized lawyering, and web-based access to what were traditionally arcane written sources of law, also renders a multi-media approach to the syllabus desirable. Reported cases will be mixed with film, television, and web-based depictions of legal norms. The course will examine the history, philosophy, method and disciplines of civil and common law. The course will provide students with a critical understanding of legal concepts, an introduction to the divisions of legal doctrine and an understanding of the most pressing issues facing the profession and governments today.

This course provides an introduction to the topic through discussion of how social entrepreneurs develop their ideas of social and environmental innovation, how they fund/finance their ventures, the ways in which they overcome the challenges of integrating various levels of economic performance with social/environmental impact, and the types of organizations social entrepreneurs create (for-profit, non-profit, cooperative, hybrid, etc). Through a \"deep dive\" case study of a leading social enterprise, we explore the relevance of social entrepreneurship in a changing world and heighten our understanding of the potential we each hold to be \"change makers.\"                                                                      January 2013                                                                                         Jed Emerson                                          -             T, BD                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

Drawing upon a long history of theoretical approaches, the course considers such questions as: What is literature? What is a text? What does a literary critic or scholar do? What does it mean to read literature in translation? How does language shape meaning? How do we construct meaning from a text&mdash;and why does that meaning matter? And, crucially: What is at stake in why we ask and how we answer these questions? This class will engage these questions by reading widely, from primary theoretical and critical texts to examples from print and digital material, and by exploring particular practices of literary scholarship&mdash;from archival research to work in digital humanities&mdash;that offer necessary skills for effective critical practice.

Its programmatic energy derived from the desire to remember something that seemed to have been obliterated and forgotten in the course of the Middle Ages, i.e. pagan antiquity. Basing their European&mdash;national and transnational&mdash;identities on something much older than Christianity, scholars (poets, painters, architects, composers, and philosophers) revived and developed scientifically the Greek and Roman legacy and laid the founding stones for Enlightenment and Modernity.

The course compares British, Caribbean, Latin American, South Asian, and African texts, including travelogues, whose maps envision fantasies of the other; adaptations and translations of novels, in which mimicry and magical realism reveal how &ldquo;the Empire writes back&rdquo;; and memoirs and short stories, whose fragmentary and experimental forms express how memories of violence, displacement, and exile shape individuals today.

It foregrounds movement and simultaneity, blurring boundaries between &ldquo;real&rdquo; and &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; worlds. Through texts emphasizing home, homelessness, migration, diaspora, transnationalism, tourism, the course examines how literature, film, games, graphic novels, and new media guide readers in this new landscape by charting new concepts of space and place, community, and global citizenship.

We will explore the ways in which authors reflect on their experience of modernity with stories that present mysterious situations, uncanny encounters, and events that defy rationality. Their texts present a discomfort with a reality that is experienced as modern and, therefore, discomforting and threatening. Particular attention will be paid to the specific national and historical setting of each text. This course functions as both an introduction to post-Enlightenment European literature and an in-depth study of the concept of modernity. We will be discussing the following texts, among others: Brothers Grimm, &ldquo;Bluebeard;&rdquo; Coleridge, &ldquo;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner;&rdquo; Hoffmann, &ldquo;The Sandman;&rdquo; Baudelaire, Flowers of Evil ; Dostoyevsky, Notes from Underground ; Stoker, Dracula ; Kafka, The Metamorphosis; and Saramago , The Stone Raft .

During the semester, students will read from a wide variety of literary genres including love poetry, popular epics, travelers&rsquo; accounts, geographical works and sufi mystical treatises from many different regions of the Muslim world, ranging from West Africa to South East Asia. Exploring the movement of people, goods, and ideas within works of literature and tracing the formation, circulation and transformation of Islamicate literary genres, the course focuses on the ways that literary works mediate between local, translocal, and global identities.

Long before print and the coming of the book, every society has told stories to tackle deep questions: about the human place in the world, the origins of natural phenomena, the meaning of love and war, the mystery of death. This form of literature has been called the work of &ldquo;reasoned imagination&rdquo; (Borges). Readings from classic works (Ovid, Apuleius, as well as the above) help inspire original writing projects and tales that draw on the participants&rsquo; own cultures.

It examines the various factors that lead a work to be canonized and the politics of inclusion and exclusion that underlie the cultural mythology of &ldquo;America.&rdquo; Topics to be considered include: colonial and creole identities; the relationship between writing and empire; encounters between Native Americans, Europeans, and Africans in the &ldquo;New World&rdquo;; the nature of the &ldquo;American Renaissance&rdquo;; the meaning of American individualism; the mythology of American exceptionalism; the dialectic of freedom and slavery in American rhetoric; and the American obsession with race.

With the Art of Memory as the organizing principle, our material will include works by Virginia Woolf, E.M. Forster, Joseph Conrad, John Fowles, John Berger, Margaret Atwood and Andre Aciman as well as films directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Pedro Almodovar. The course combines discussion seminars and writing workshops with one-on-one conferences with the professor. Students work on honing their own narrative voices and aim to produce honors level work by the end of the semester.

Better question: Where can we go, and what can we do, as creative writers? Our course begins with the nuts and bolts &mdash; learning the tools, acquiring the skills, understanding the architecture of story telling. Then, together, we build. We&rsquo;ll also play, debate, and experiment: discovering the line between news articles and fiction; creating characters using social media conventions; writing more vividly by unlocking our senses; declaring our manifestos; understanding publishing; examining censorship; and looking over the edge into the abyss with growing confidence. For writing should never be solitary: we&rsquo;ll learn from the works of published writers; more importantly, we&rsquo;ll learn from each other&mdash;not just how to write but why we write. And we&rsquo;ll stride forward with the fictionist&rsquo;s creativity, the journalist&rsquo;s rigor, and the critic&rsquo;s understanding. Fiction, and you, will never be the same.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 131J Performative Literature: Acting Epics, Romances, Ballads and Stories                                                        This course presents narrative literature as a set of springboards to performance, rather than as a series of books simply to be read privately. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach literature as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory, as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and on their language abilities. For their final project, students collaborate in staging and performing a substantial piece of traditional narrative. Works discussed and performed include epics, romances, ballads, and short tales of various kinds, drawn from world literature. In J-term 2015, students will perform from the medieval French Arthurian romance Yvain or the Knight with the Lion by Chretien de Troyes and from the Spanish epic The Song of the Cid . Short works (in a Course Packet) will be taken from the following&mdash;and will thus represent a wide range of kinds of narrative and modes of performance: ballads from Spain and India; tales from Latin ( The Scholar&rsquo;s Guide ), medieval French (various types of tales), Turkish ( The Book of Dede Korkut ), Hebrew ( Tahkemoni ), Arabic ( Kalila and Dimna , 1001 Nights ), and Urdu ( Amir Hamza ). Students will be invited to perform in the original languages wherever possible, and an attempt will be made to include works from the students&rsquo; own traditions.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

LITCW-AD 133J Tales that Travel: Storytelling and Storytellers in Eurasia, 10th-16th c.                                                        Long before modern media sent stories around the world at lightning speed, good tales traveled. This course explores the travel of tales and considers the ways in which a common culture of story and storytelling can be found throughout pre-modern Europe, Middle East, South and East Asia. Drawing on stories and scholarship from many different traditions, it examines the role of storytelling in human culture, discusses the performance and circulation of stories, and reflects on examples of the types of tales that traveled--including tales of origin, of wisdom (and folly), of trickery (and truthfulness), of success (and failure), of youth and age, of love and the battle of the sexes&mdash;and many others.

Twelfth-century geographer al-Idrisi reports that eight Arabs sailed west from Lisbon to discover what lay beyond the &ldquo;Sea of Darkness&rdquo; (the Atlantic ocean), and arrived somewhere in South America. Columbus reportedly had a copy of al-Idrisi&rsquo;s book with him when he embarked on his first voyage in 1492, and he took with him Louis de Torre, a converted Moor, to act as an Arabic interpreter once the expedition reached India. Some of the earliest slave narratives were written in Arabic by literate Muslim captives from West Africa. However, large-scale Arab immigration to the Americas did not begin until the nineteenth century, and since then those immigrants and their descendants have participated in a substantial, though little known, literature in Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. We will examine this tradition within the emergent paradigms of inter-American and hemispheric studies and discuss recent scholarship on the globalization of U.S. American studies and its interface with Latin American and Arabic studies. We will then read a selection of literary works by and about Arab immigrants and their descendants throughout the Americas.

LITCW-AD 139 Early Modern English Drama: Staging the World                                              Doomed lovers, military conquest, imported luxury goods, political treachery, religious conversion, spectacular bodies&mdash;and pirates. These are some of the plot elements that figured stereotypes and represented transnational movement of people, objects, and stories around the globe in English Renaissance drama. This course will read English plays preoccupied with staging otherness&mdash;from the 1580s to the 1640s&mdash;in genres from city comedy to revenge tragedy to ask how these imaginative constructions draw upon the world to consider what it meant to be &ldquo;English.&rdquo; We will examine the intersection of identity and nation as these ideas are insisted upon&mdash;and fractured&mdash;in the popular imagination of the theater. We will ask: how is the self constructed in relation to the world? Which figures of the &ldquo;Other&rdquo; become particularly important to notions of English identity? How is the English body imagined, and what happens to English bodies when they venture elsewhere? Likely texts include Christopher Marlowe, Tamburlaine the Great; William Shakespeare, The Comedy of Errors ; Thomas Dekker, The Shoemaker&rsquo;s Holiday ; Ben Jonson, Volpone ; Thomas Heywood, The English Traveller ; William Rowley, The Birth of Merlin ; Robert Daborne, A Christian Turned Turk ; John Webster, The White Devil ; and Richard Brome, The Antipodes .    *Prerequite: or instructor approval.

The basic spread of subjects treated is poetry and prose narrative; but there will be a nuancing of literary genres and categories (especially of those peculiar to the Arabic tradition). Students will be introduced to main approaches to the study of this broad and deep literary tradition. Texts will include selections from: Pre-Islamic heroic poetry; Umayyad love poetry; Abbasid courtly poetry and its influence on the Andalus; libertine poetry in all its registers from the early Abbasid to the Mamluke period. Prose literature will include The Qur&#39;an; Hadith; Apocrypha of the Prophets; Picaresque Maqamahs; the Arabian Nights; and proto-novels from the 19th century.

Students will write poetry as well as learn terms for critical analysis. Some of the threads of inquiry and inspiration that will run through the workshop include: What is poetry? What does it do? What is the state of poetry now? What does it mean to write and read poems in English if it is not your home or only language? In addition to workshopping peers&rsquo; poetry, participants will learn about the chapbook tradition, make their own small books of between 15 and 25 pages, and organize readings to experiment with various performance-based approaches to poetry.

MATH-AD 101 Mathematical Functions                                             A fundamental understanding of mathematical functions is critical before engaging in the rigors of calculus. This course examines single variable functions, including their algebraic and geometric properties. By necessity, the course begins with a rigorous exploration of the following question: What is a function, and how can it be represented geometrically as a graph? The course delves into standard function manipulations and examines a range of mathematical functions, including polynomial, rational, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Placement into Mathematical Functions is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

MATH-AD 102 Introduction to Vector Mathematics                                             A vector is a mathematical measure of change in magnitude and direction of a physical event. A displacement from one location to another in a two or three-dimensional space, and the quantity and direction of force applied to move an object are examples of vectors. This course studies the algebra of vector addition, subtraction, and the dot product and cross product multiplications. The course further provides an in-depth study of trigonometric functions, trigonometric equations and trigonometric identities, including double angle and half angle formulas and their application. The concepts of average rate of change, limit and derivatives for both scalars and vectors in two and three-dimensional coordinates are discussed and the merits of each are presented. Systems of linear equations are presented using matrices. Finite and infinite sequences are discussed. Some basic properties of real and complex numbers are reviewed and several applications of the algebra of complex numbers are presented to illustrate how to use them in applications.    *Prerequiste: MATH-AD 101 or Math Placement.

All existing results from the three fundamental categories of mathematics -- geometry, algebra, and analysis -- can be formally expressed in terms of set theory, predicates, quantifiers and logical connectives. This course explores the axiomatic method, some elements of logic and formal languages, and set theory. In addition, the system of real numbers and all other fundamental number systems can be firmly established on the ground of natural numbers; therefore, the course introduces elementary arithmetic and the universal method of constructing new objects from already known sets by means of equivalence relations. Abstract concepts are introduced through basic but fundamental and universal examples or problems, carefully chosen as illuminants of broader ideas and sources of new theoretical and practical applications.

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to other disciplines are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly recitation focused on applications. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.

Integration and differentiation of functions of several variables require new concepts and techniques. The course has applications to science and engineering as well as economics. Specific topics include vectors in the plane and space; partial derivatives with applications; double and triple integrals; spherical and cylindrical coordinates; surface and line integrals; and divergence, gradient, and curl. In addition, the theorems of Gauss and Stokes are rigorously introduced.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations.

Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The course studies first- and second-order equations, solutions using infinite series, Laplace transforms, linear systems, numerical methods.    *MATH-AD 116 can be taken as a corequisite.

It is further used in other branches of mathematics, including algebraic geometry and number theory, and also has diverse applications in science and engineering: fluid dynamics, elasticity, nuclear and electrical engineering, to name just a few examples. The geometrical content of analysis in the complex plane is especially appealing. Topics covered include: complex numbers and complex functions; differentiation and the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Cauchy&rsquo;s theorem, and the Cauchy integral formula; singularities, residues, Taylor and Laurent series; fractional linear transformations and conformal mapping; analytic continuation and Riemann theorem (time permitting).    *Prerequistes: MATH-AD 112 and MATH-AD 116, or instructor&#39;s approval.

MATH-AD 331 Topology                                             Topology is a major branch of mathematics, which is concerned with the geometry of sets of points in space of arbitrary dimension. One aspect of the subject deals with the classification of sets based upon their structure, not their specific shape. Topology has applications in physics, biology, and dynamical systems. The material includes metric spaces, topological spaces, compactness, connectedness, covering spaces,                                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Arman Mimar                                           -             MW, 2:10-3:25 pm                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth mathematics capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

MDENV-AD 115 The Global Debate on Green Growth                                              In March 2012, the OECD published its influential Environmental Outlook Report to 2050, confirming that the world is faced with an explosive new cocktail of geopolitical challenges: population explosion, environmental degradation, the failure to stop climate change, and the increased competition over limited natural resources. In response, governments are increasingly turning to renewables and high tech to diversify their energy mix and to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in order to stimulate stagnant economies and create new jobs. Ironically, the transition to a low fossil fuel economy through the use of RES and high tech applications has led to the creation of new global race over limited resources, such as rare earths, and this competition has already given rise to a series of fresh global political and economic realities, tensions, and disputes. We will examine how major industrial powers are approaching the asymmetric threat of climate change; the nature of contemporary resource competition; the way policy decisions are influenced by political rhetoric and public opinion; and the overall economic and political impact of climate change on international relations.

Thinking about how we interface with these tools beyond the mouse and keyboard, we can approach software and electronics as artists and designers and explore new paradigms of interaction with machines and each other. This introductory course will provide students hands-on experience with screen-based and physical interaction design through programming and electronics using microcontrollers, electronics, and writing our own software. Fundamentals of programming and circuit design will supplement readings on human-computer interaction and design theory. Weekly lab exercises encourage students to experiment freely, creating their own novel interfaces and controls for working with machines.

What is media&rsquo;s role in creating culture, influencing political events, forming communities, and archiving? What is ubiquitous computing, embedded computing, physical computing? How is cyberspace merging with physical space and how does participatory media change the face of cultural institutions, historical narratives, and mapping? Students are asked to consider the role of media in their own lives and consider where it both fails and succeeds.

This course studies these technologies through the lens of social, political, and ethical values investigating whether and how technical systems promote or impede values to which we are committed. While we explore concepts and literatures, students form collaborative groups, select projects and apply philosophical and social theories of technology to analyze and, possibly, design, prototype, and build systems. The course welcomes students with a variety of backgrounds and skills, though some prior understanding of and experience with digital technology and media, and computing or social, political, and ethical analysis is recommended.

MDMED-AD 116 Mashups - Creating with Web APIs                                             As the World Wide Web continues to grow and pervade our everyday lives, an ever-increasing amount of data and digital services are becoming accessible to us through public web APIs - Application Programming Interfaces. Common to many web sites, including YouTube, Twitter, Google Maps, Wikipedia and more, these web APIs offer a way to programmatically request and re-purpose endless troves of information. How might we use these available resources to create unique, creative, and compelling web experiences of our own? Subscribing to a process-oriented approach, much of class time will be spent reviewing and writing code, primarily Javascript, for client-side (front-end) web development.

We engage class and contemporary urban questions such as: How does city-living shape our minds and shift our patterns of social interaction? How does the built environment relate to the local ecology and our experience of everyday life? How are civic and political institutions addressing emerging problems related to massive population growth, sprawl, pollution, and polarization? Students should be prepared for rigorous critical thinking and vigorous participation.

MDURB-AD 122J Cities and Consumption                                                                              Consumption of objects, images, and places is central to the culture and economy of modern life. The class addresses three questions: Why do we want things? How do physical places organize our consumer desires? And how does place become an object of consumption? This class explores how the relationship between consumption and cities has developed by examining three key moments: world fairs and the invention of the department store in the late nineteenth century; the rise of malls in the mid-20th century and the contemporary period of digital commerce and the global commodity city. Readings include Thorstein Veblen&rsquo;s Theory of the Leisure Class, Karl Marx&rsquo;s essay on commodity fetishism, Max Weber&rsquo;s essays on economy and society, Georg Simmel&rsquo;s Metropolis and Mental Life and selections from Walter Benjamin&rsquo;s Arcades project. We relate these texts to changing forms of consumption in different settings, from Argentina to China and the United States. Site visits in Buenos Aires help deepen our analysis of cities and consumption, and illuminate our surroundings.

MDURB-AD 123J Nature of Urban Design: a New York Perspective on Resilience                                             This course is an introduction to the role of urban design in global sustainability. The first step is to understand how cities affect climate and how climate affects cities by examining New York as a model. New York is a coastal city faced with the simultaneous requirement to grow its population by a million people yet to improve the quality of its civic life when climate events threaten both its urban fabric and critical infrastructure. How New York uses urban design not just to survive but to thrive is the subject of this course, introducing the people, products, and processes of urban design. The city itself frequently serves as classroom, with students exploring and recording examples of urban design through the neighborhoods they transform.

MDURB-AD 124J Urban Form of Shanghai                                                                   Shanghai has evolved markedly through key stages in the history of urban form, vestiges of which are found within the city today: an old walled \"Chinese city\"; tree-lined boulevards and commercial avenues of 19th and 20th century foreign settlements; and suburban development in Pudong. This class examines each key stage, combining readings with in situ urban inquiry.

MDURB-AD 125J Global City                                             Cities are our most powerful engines of growth and increasingly the economic organizing units of our time. More than half the world&rsquo;s population lives in cities and urban areas, a figure that grow to 70 percent by 2050. We will look in detail at great global cities across the world, giving students the concepts and tools to understand their evolution and the critical roles they play in economic, social, cultural and human development. The course also helps students better understand how their choice of a city to live in can have an indelible impact on their lives and careers.

MDURB-AD 126J Cities, Nations, and Globalization                                             What is globalization and when did it begin? What is the difference between an imperial city and a global capital? Imperial London provides a way to explore this question, and New York, which was not capital of a vast colonial empire, provides a useful comparison case. There is also the question of globalization&rsquo;s impact on the relation between cities and nations? More directly, have global cities outgrown their host nations? Is globalization a new iteration of the world economy, or is it more multi-faceted, with social, political, and cultural implications, including new dimensions of citizenship and social movements? Can one &quot;read&quot; shift from the age of empire to that of globalization in the built environment of the city of London, New York, Jakarta, or Ho Chi Minh City? Assignments includes literary sources and visual analysis as well as social science and humanistic scholarship.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Metropolitan Studies Dept: This course counts for the major and minor                                                                       January 2014                                                                                          Tom Bender                                                                                         Taught in London, England                                          This course appears in...

MDURB-AD 127J Public Space and the Life of Cities                                             Public spaces play an essential role in the life of cities and their residents. Public squares and parks, streets and esplanades&mdash;these are often the signature spaces that constitute a city&rsquo;s distinctive identity. They are also the settings of everyday life, mixing bowls where a city&rsquo;s diverse communities interact, forums for individual as well as collective action and expression. This course explores the nature of public space in cities around the world, with attention to their physical character and design, their history, their pictorial and literary representation, and the political and social practices that activate public space. We will explore three overarching questions. What do we mean by &ldquo;public&rdquo; and &ldquo;public space&rdquo;? What are common characteristics of public spaces and how do people use them? And why are public spaces important to city life? In addition to historical and contemporary squares and streetscapes of Europe and the Middle East, we will draw upon case studies in Sydney as well as the hometowns of our students.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

MUSIC-AD 100 Music Theory Fundamentals                                  This course provides students with essential musical skills and conceptual frameworks that will ready them for future coursework in music theory. These fundamentals are explored in relation not only to canonic Western &quot;classical&quot; music, but also to popular music and musics from around the globe. Topics include Western music notation (reading music), tuning systems, the science of sound, instruments, scales, modes, keys, intervals, chords, jazz/pop/rock chord symbols, figured bass, harmonic analysis using Roman numerals, species counterpoint, basic four-part chorale writing, and common forms and genres. A weekly lab session serves to develop listening skills, basic keyboard skills, sight-singing, and dictation.     Note: Music Theory Fundamentals is a prerequisite for the required music major gateway course, Music Theory &amp; Analysis I. Students can take a placement test to pass out of Music Theory Fundamentals and enroll directly in Music Theory &amp; Analysis I.

We explore approaches to music, stressing historical, documentary, and archival work and contrast these with ethnographic, philosophical, and empirical/scientific modes of investigation. Repertoire varies from year to year, but includes such aspects as Beethoven symphonies, North Indian instrumental music, Middle Eastern song, and new technologies such as auto-tune and new arenas for music such as video games and ring tones.

This course views musical structures and constructs broadly, referencing phenomena from musics around the world. The bulk of the course is devoted to an exploration of melody, harmony, and counterpoint in the music of diatonic tonality through projects in directed composition and analysis. Repertoire is drawn from both &ldquo;classical&rdquo; (common practice period) music and more recent examples of tonality, including popular music. Regular reading and listening assignments place techniques in historical context and expose students to a wide range of musical examples. Weekly lab sections are devoted to skills in musicianship: listening, sight-singing, dictation, and basic keyboard skills. Students may be required to take MUSIC- AD 100 prior to MUSIC-AD 105 upon taking a placement examination. Please contact Instructor or Music Program Head for details.

Today&#39;s Levant, Maghreb and Gulf offer an enormous wealth of cultural diversity and local variation that a strictly political reading fails to recognize. Each year the course focuses on two different regions from among North Africa, the Levant, the Gulf, Turkey and Iran, in order to understand the complex socio-cultural dynamics of the broader region. Focusing on issues of gender, religion and nation, the course pays particular attention to the development of the Maqam system, ritual practices of religious minorities, and the popular musical styles that mobilize social movements.

Depending on the experience and expertise of the instructor, the course might focus on Bach fugues, Mozart opera, Schoenberg&rsquo;s piano music, or the development of electro-acoustic music. While the focus is on issues of how these works create effects, and resultant questions of meaning, we also look at sociological and political issues.    *This course is no longer being offered.

Students work in creative music projects involving original writing/composition, recording, and performance. The course additionally has a historical scope in which students consider how these practices have been addressed at different key moments in history and differed according to national and regional contexts.

Beginning with music in the myths and ancient histories of Sumeria, Egypt, and Greece, the seminar concludes with an examination of music and musical production within emerging global and transnational networks of power, where new technologies of mediation are radically re-orchestrating our engagement with sound and the world. Within the broad scope of this overview, we will examine the historical repertoire that has come to be known as &quot;classical music.&quot; The course explores the idea of a permanent canon of musical masterworks, which as a nineteenth-century invention, expanded gradually to include much earlier music as it became increasingly known. The course is not limited to the European musical tradition and canon but also examines non-Western musical traditions in the Middle East, India, and Asia, which grew out of a complex confluence of established practices.

This course surveys a variety of musics, with a particular emphasis on careful listening and aural analysis. Assigned readings help to contextualize and problematize the listening, shedding light on musical preconceptions and biases. Each student chooses from a diverse array of research topics early in the semester, preparing for a substantial presentation during the final weeks of class.

Students develop artistic collaborative projects involving sound, movement, digital video, lighting, interaction technologies, and telematics, which are presented publicly at the end of the semester. This course requires no skills and is open to anyone willing to establish a collaborative project involving different art forms and other domains.    * Note: The former title of this course was &#39;Collaborating in the Digital Domain&#39;.

MUSIC-AD 214 Global Hip-Hop                                  In the past decades, hip-hop has transformed from a local, economically viable method of musical production in the post-industrial city to the transnational core of the popular music industry. This course will introduce students from any discipline to critical scholarly approaches to hip-hop and its multiple roles worldwide in youth advocacy, community organizing, and political protest. We will examine its roots in New York, West Africa and the Caribbean, and its enormous appeal among urban youth today. This course emphasizes readings that engage critically with migration, class, gender performativity and sociolinguistics, supported by case studies from Europe, Africa and the Middle East. For course essays, students will prepare CD reviews or concert reports for publication in academic journals or the popular press.    *Note: This course number has been changed to MUSIC-AD 114.

MUSIC-AD 260 Intro to Maqam &amp; Usul: Modality, Rhythm &amp; Improvisation in the Art Music of the ME                                                                                                    The central tradition of Middle East art music was based in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, where it achieved its mature form from the early 18th until the beginning of the 20th century, and interacted with the music of major cities such as Aleppo, Baghdad and Cairo, as well as the music of the Byzantine church. This course presents the development of maqam (mode) as both theory and practice, based on classical texts, compositions from the 17th until the 20th centuries, and the music of modern masters, since the advent of sound recording. The principal focus will be on the analysis of 1) modality, intonation and modulation, 2) relations of melody and rhythm (usul) in compositions, 3) non-metrical improvisation (taksim).    *Note: Prerequiste- reading ability of musical notation.    * This course is no longer being offered.

MUSST-AD 113J Shared Cultural Heritage: Policies and Perspectives                                                                                         An intensive trade and shipping network connected many countries around the Indian Ocean with the Far East and Europe. Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

MUSST-AD 114J Museums, Communities, and Public Art                                                                                         While New York City is known for its world class museums and endless array of commercial galleries, the mainstream art world in Manhattan is only half the story. This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

MUSST-AD 214JX Sharing Heritage of the Arabian Trade Routes                                                                                         In the 17th century the Ya&rsquo;rubi dynasty drove the Portuguese from Muscat and East Africa and reinstalled Omani dominance in the region. The Omanis built on the extensive Arabian trade network that for centuries connected Asia, Africa, and Europe. Long-distance trade left behind cultural traces in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, museum collections, and archives. These cultural footprints are now often considered \"shared cultural heritage\". Notably Zanzibar and Kilwa (Tanzania), where Omani once ruled, were named as UNESCO World Heritage sites for their universal and outstanding value. But what do these values mean and for whom? What makes historical remains heritage? What happens if \"universal values\" are not shared but contested? These fundamental questions steer us to understand the principles of heritage production and management. The Arabian trading routes provide an excellent context to explore the multi-layered and multi-vocal aspects of heritage. The course includes a field project in Zanzibar.

MUSST-AD 215J Museums in Global Context                                             This course surveys the history and representational role of museums, from its origins in cabinets of curiosity formed during the age of exploration to the global proliferation of museums today. Our goal is to provide a critical framework to understand how and why museums have evolved and function in a globalized world. We will consider how Enlightment collecting practices led to the development of the &ldquo;universal museum&rdquo; in an era of colonial expansion and examine how this dominant model has expanded &ndash; and been challenged &ndash; over the past century. Among the issues to be discussed are: the organization and display of collections, the language and symbolism of museum architecture, the relationship of museums to their public(s), heritage and repatriation, cultural diversity and the politics of representation, and globalized collecting and exhibiting today. Classroom lectures will be supplemented by field trips drawing on the rich diversity of museums in the New York area.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

The class will focus on the study of conflict, aggression, civil unrest,  violence, and terrorism, based on the idea that understanding the psychological roots of conflict is essential for understanding the means toward achieving peace within and between individuals, and achieving cooperation within and between groups. The class will consider the motives behind conflict, the origins of collective action, perceptions of justice in fueling conflict, the role of emotions, including anger and empathy, the role of ideologies and morality systems, the rationalization and justification of aggression and inequality, and the psychological consequences of conflict. The class will consider evidence relevant to Eastern philosophical approaches to peace and conflict, such as meditation, Buddhism, etc., including their neuropsychological and physiological markers. Finally, the class will critically evaluate attempts at understanding and reducing terrorism, as well as other conflict resolution strategies from a psychological perspective. In general, students will be able to integrate a range of perspectives to evaluate the current state of the science of peace psychology, including its strengths and shortcomings.

PEACE-AD 120 Transitional Justice                                                        How do societies emerging from authoritarian rule and intra-state armed conflict deal with past mass human rights violations? In their attempts to address past gross human rights violations, what types of justice mechanisms do such societies employ? Ruti Teitel first coined the term transitional justice in her book Transitional Justice (2000). Since then the term has circulated widely in scholarly and policy communities to describe a set of mechanisms and approaches to address past violence. This course analyzes the problems facing societies with past human rights violations, the numerous options they have at their disposal to engage these abuses and the political, economic, legal and ethical ramifications of each choice. The course is organized into two sections. The first section introduces theoretical approaches to study of transitional justice. The second section analyzes the most frequently used mechanisms, focusing on their potency in advancing democratization and reconciliation. Case studies include: the prosecutions of Nuremberg and Tokyo; the international tribunals of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda; the hybrid tribunals of Timor Leste, Cambodia, and Sierra Leone.

PEACE-AD 121 International Organizations and Global Governance                                                        The creation of international organizations (IOs) is a crucial moment in historical efforts at structuring and civilizing international affairs. Organizations such as the League of Nations and the  UN have been at the heart of attempts to create a peaceful international order. In today&rsquo;s international system, international organizations perform a huge variety of challenging tasks: they  provide safeguards against the military use of nuclear technology, destroy chemical weapons, convict war criminals, assist developing countries with loans, and deliver food to populations in need. This course will examine international organizations&rsquo; origin, logic and impact within both global and local contexts. It will provide students with a better understanding of both the theory and the practice of international cooperation and global governance. Specifically, it will study why states cooperate in IOs, how member states and international bureaucracies interact, and how IOs contribute to peaceful conflict management and human development in today&rsquo;s international system.

PEACE-AD 122J Truth, Reconciliation and Justice in Post-Conflict Situations                                             The focus will primarily be on the experience of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa, why and how it came into being, how it was structured, how it functioned and its impact on the nation and national development. Sub-themes will include an analysis of four kinds of truth, the problem of denialism, and the difference and relation between restorative and punitive justice. The course will offer comparative reflections on how similar issues have been dealt with in Northern Ireland, Colombia and Sri Lanka.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

PEACE-AD 123 Peacebuilding                                                        This course will help students build an analytical understanding of the potentials and pitfalls of international intervention in conflict-affected societies. Postwar peacebuilding has become a growing, yet highly controversial international activity. The experiences with attempts to promote peace and increase state capacity are sobering, in particular in terrains such as Somalia, the DRC and Afghanistan. How can the international community promote peace in these hard cases? What are the flaws of the existing &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; approach to peacebuilding and what are promising alternatives to it? The course will examine the current debates on peacebuilding and will invite practitioners from international organizations to discuss their approach to promoting peace in some of the world&rsquo;s most challenging regions.

PEACE-AD 124 Causes and Prevention of Violence                                             This course will study violence as a problem in public health and preventive medicine &ndash; indeed, the most important problem, since it could potentially, in this age of nuclear weapons, cause the self-extinction of the human species. To do so, we will review writings that illuminate and illustrate the causes and prevention of violence, including wars and civil wars, inter-ethnic violence, revolutions, genocide, terrorism and structural violence. We will study how the moral emotions, shame and guilt, can motivate as well as inhibit both group and individual violence. We will also examine cognitive causes of violence, including the backlash, in the form of &ldquo;political religions&rdquo; &ndash; Nationalism, Imperialism, Totalitarianism, and most recently, Apocalyptic Fundamentalism -- against the modern scientific world-view and its challenge to the credibility of the traditional sources of moral and political authority. Readings will include the Bible and works by Thucydides, Shakespeare, Buchner, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky, Joseph Conrad, Einstein, Freud, Kafka, Adorno, Frantz Fanon and Hannah Arendt.

Can we think of ourselves as responsible agents while also regarding ourselves as part of the natural order? Some philosophers have argued that if our actions are causally determined, then freedom of the will is impossible. Others have argued that freedom does not depend on the truth or falsity of causal determinism. Is free will possible in a world where every event is causally determined? Are there different kinds of freedom? If so, are all kinds of freedom equally worth having? Must we act freely in order to be responsible for our actions? Do the social institutions of reward and punishment depend for their justification upon the existence of responsible, free agents? We will discuss the nature of persons, action, freedom, and responsibility in an effort to answer these questions.

How could a benevolent and omnipotent God permit the existence of evil and misfortune? Is it ever rational to form beliefs about matters which transcend the realm of the empirical? Is the concept of a specifically religious experience a coherent one? If not, can religious beliefs be supported by other means? Alternatively, is the entire project of evaluating religious discourse as a set of claims about transcendent realities misguided? What should we make of the alternative explanations of religion and religious phenomena offered by philosophers from al-Farabi to Marx and Nietzsche?

This course examines various reasons we might have for holding these views, and various challenges that have been raised against them. Why should we care about knowledge as long as our beliefs prove useful and efficacious? Is truth -- and thus knowledge - more accurately understood as a culturally relative notion, so that what&rsquo;s true for you might not be true for me? It is ever rational to let purely pragmatic reasons for belief trump considerations of truth? And could we ever will (or force) ourselves to believe something? These are some of the questions we&rsquo;ll explore in this course.

PHIL-AD 180 Introduction to Logic                                             All philosophers are wise, and Socrates is a philosopher. Therefore, Socrates is wise. Our topic is the nature of this &ldquo;therefore.&rdquo; Logic is the science of reasoning&mdash;the study of the ways in which statements support or contradict one another. In this course, we investigate and expose the logical structure of everyday language and see how the correctness or incorrectness of reasoning depends on this structure. To aid us, we develop a formal language that makes this underlying structure more perspicuous. With this formal language at our disposal, we are able to construct elaborate proofs and explore the logical relations among the various steps of complex arguments.

Through their work, we will grapple with a range of pressing philosophical questions, including: Is happiness more than a subjective state of consciousness? Is death harmful? Do we have free will? Do we have obligations to others that override the pursuit of our own self-interest? What is the relation between the mind (or the soul) and the body? Since most of the philosophers we will be studying thought that philosophy must be systematic in its approach, we will also try to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of this kind of approach to philosophical questions.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

The Arabic authors were heirs to the entire Greek philosophical legacy and took it in a number of important and innovative directions, some of which have remained with us to the present day. Topics broached include knowledge, certitude, and the rules of rational debate; the metaphysical distinction between essence and existence and the attendant notions of necessity and contingency; the medieval analysis of the soul, the psychic faculties, and moral psychology; and the role of religion in society and the analysis of religious claims within philosophy.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

We focus on six philosophers: Ren&eacute; Descartes, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Immanuel Kant. Through their writings, we trace and study philosophical arguments and debates concerning the possibility and extent of our knowledge of the external world, the nature of the self, the nature of substance and causation, the existence of God, the nature of perception, and the relation between our minds and our bodies.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

In this course we wrestle with some of the most fundamental questions we are capable of posing, such as: What kinds of things exist? Are there minds or material bodies? What, for that matter, is existence? Is change illusory? What is truth? To what extent is reality independent of our thoughts about it? What is the difference between the possible and the actual? Are human actions free or causally determined? What is a person?    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

How is that possible? How do our words manage to pick out or latch onto particular portions of reality, even ones with which we&rsquo;ve never had any contact? How does language enable us to convey thoughts about everything from Abu Dhabi, to the hopes of a friend, to the stars beyond our galaxy? For that matter, what are the thoughts, or the meanings, that our words carry or communicate? We explore these and other philosophical questions about language through a reading of seminal works by twentieth-century thinkers.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

How is the mind related to the brain? Are they identical? How can we know when something has a mind? Could a machine have a mind? Could a machine be conscious? What, for that matter, is consciousness? Can consciousness be reconciled with a scientific view of the world? How do our mental states and attitudes, whatever they are, arise from activity in the brain and cause our actions? The rise of cognitive science has shed new light on many of these old questions. Can philosophers and cognitive scientists learn from each other even as they approach the study of the mind in their different ways? We examine various answers to these questions, drawing readings from classical and contemporary philosophy as well as from cognitive science.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

This course examines various questions concerning the nature and practice of science that arise from this widespread attitude. For example, scientific theories are often thought to be subject to empirical scrutiny in ways that other theories are not. To what extent is this belief well-founded? Is it rational to believe that our best scientific theories are even approximately true? What justifies the claim that different types of evidence lend varying degrees of support to a particular theory, or that a single piece of evidence supports one theory more than another? Similarly, it is often claimed that scientific theories provide us with &ldquo;real&rdquo; explanations of physical phenomena, whereas other theories aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;genuinely explanatory.&rdquo; To what extent is this true? What exactly is a scientific explanation, and how is it different (if at all) from a mere prediction or mathematical derivation? Can false theories provide good explanations? Some familiarity with science would be helpful but is not required.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

How can we reconcile the demands of morality with the personal obligations that spring from friendships and other relationships? Do the ends ever justify the means? We will grapple with these and other questions as we explore three of the most influential theories in Western ethical philosophy: Aristotle&rsquo;s ethics of virtue, Immanuel Kant&rsquo;s moral rationalism, and John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s utilitarianism. We will also encounter one of modern morality&rsquo;s harshest critics: Friedrich Nietzsche.    *Prerequiste: One Introductory Elective in Philosophy (i.e., PHIL-AD 101-119).

What justifies the state&rsquo;s exercise of such authority? Could it be justified because we have at least implicitly given our consent to it? This is only one central question in political philosophy. Others include: What form of government best serves the people? Who are the people, anyway? What is justice? Do we have fundamental rights to property or to free expression? If so, what is the source of these rights? What is freedom, and are there different kinds? What is the proper relation between freedom and equality? Is equality desirable? Can we live in a genuine community that is not a community of equals? As we grapple with such questions, we draw on writings from both classical and contemporary philosophers.

He is the founding father of both logic and biology, and there is nary a field of inquiry that he didn&#39;t touch upon and improve through his insights. By understanding Aristotle, we come to understand the trajectory taken not only by European but also by Arabic intellectual culture and science. This course will begin with an introduction to Aristotle&rsquo;s general approach and methodology. We will then examine the philosopher&rsquo;s investigations into nature, science, zoology, psychology, metaphysics, ethics, politics, rhetoric, and literary theory. Along the way we will track Aristotle&rsquo;s legacy as an influence spanning various cultures.

PHYED-AD 37 Total Fitness                                             Total Fitness describes its strength and conditioning program as &ldquo;constantly varied, high intensity, functional movement&rdquo;. It is a program geared to prepare the body for better fitness by not focusing on any one activity. Rather, Total Fitness wants the body prepared for any and all activities or sports. It focuses on core strengthening and conditioning. It is not the same routine every day, but a regular mixture of activities designed to activate and strengthen various core and major muscle groups from a variety of tasks. Workouts are typically short&mdash;20 minutes or less&mdash;and intense, demanding all-out physical exertion. They combine movements such as sprinting, rowing, jumping rope, climbing rope, flipping tires, weightlifting, and carrying sandbags, kettlebells etc. CrossFit has attracted elite athletes, military personnel, police officers and now regular people who want to achieve higher levels of fitness. The Total Fitness program seeks to achieve this through balance in ten fitness categories: heart and lung endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance and accuracy.

PHYED-AD 43 Corrective Excercise                                             This course is a combination of three corrective exercise methods, namely Trigger Point Therapy, Rehabilitation and Muscle Activation.  Trigger Point Therapy will relieve the muscle tightness and increase range of motion, facilitating efficient blood circulation. This actually increases energy levels, muscle strength and delays fatigue which is invaluable to the competitive athlete. The range of motion will enable you to use the full potential of the muscle and the restored muscle with improved blood supply; will be able to work harder for much longer, without tightening up on you. Essentially what this amounts to is a dramatic Improvement in your sports performance.  Rehabilitation of muscles can bring about reduced pain and accelerated healing of injured tissue, Improved range of motion and muscle mass, Strengthening, conditioning, and weight loss and better overall well-being and improved quality of life.  Muscle activation looks at the body compensations as it loses its ability to engage the prime movers of the body. These compensations reduce the ability of the body to work at its highest effectiveness, and increase the risk of injury.

PHYED-AD 44 Kettlebells                                             Kettlebells are cast iron weights shaped like a ball with a handle for easy gripping. Kettlebells offer a different kind of training using dynamic moves targeting almost every aspect of fitness &ndash; endurance, strength, balance, agility and cardio endurance. Kettlebell exercises are in their nature holistic; therefore they work several muscles simultaneously and may be repeated continuously for several minutes or with short breaks. This combination makes the exercise partially aerobic and more similar to High-intensity interval training rather than to traditional weight lifting.

PHYED-AD 47 Yoga                                             Individuals learn the basic disciplines of yoga, focusing on body awareness, appropriate warm ups, beginning yoga postures, breathing, and relaxation skills. Upon successful completion, students understand and are able to demonstrate the basic components of yoga practice, including safe, stable body alignment and classic yoga postures. Phoenix Rising Yoga (PRY) works on the assumption that the body and mind are not separate, and that physical and emotional issues are profoundly connected. As a body-based, approach to self-awareness, PRY uses assisted yoga postures accompanied by facilitative dialogue that can help you to deepen your connection to your inner experiences and open the doors to greater self-awareness. This, in turn, has the potential to facilitate the identification and practice of the next steps in your life&rsquo;s journey.

PHYED-AD 51 Aikido                                             Aikido is a Japanese martial art based on the philosophy of blending with an opponents power and redirecting their aggressiveness to a mutually safe place rather than trying to counter power with power. It is therefore not dependent on the individual&#39;s size and strength. Elements of classical Japanese sword and staff are incorporated into the empty hand techniques, which consist of throwing and pinning defenses against a wide variety of attacks. The class is open to both beginners and advanced practitioners and people of all fitness levels.  An in-house instructor will teach this course.    *Note : (Spring 2015) make up and catch-up sessions on Thursdays.

PHYS-AD 317 Multi-wavelength Astronomy                                             Multi-wavelength Astronomy is more an observational science than an experimental one. The prime source of our information is light, and until the 20th century, that meant only optical light, but starting with the discovery of cosmic radio waves in 1931, the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum has been opened up to astronomers. Each region of the spectrum (radio, microwave, infrared, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray) requires different detection technologies and analysis techniques. Each waveband tells us about different aspects of astronomical sources and the Universe as a whole. This course will provide an overview of multi-wavelength astronomy: the telescopes, techniques, emission mechanisms, sources, and primary science questions relevant to each observing band. A good understanding of basic physics will be assumed, but no specialized knowledge in astronomy or advanced physics topics is required.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar series so that students can begin the Capstone Project in the fall semester of their senior year. Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

Topics include: the basics of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory; basic solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and the core; and the extensions of these solutions to dynamic games and situations of incomplete information. Students are exposed to a variety of simple games with varied and useful applications: zero-sum games; the Prisoner&rsquo;s Dilemma; coordination games; the Battle of the Sexes; repeated games; and elementary signaling games. The course relies on a wide array of example applications of game theory in the social sciences.    Students who have a strong mathematical background but who do not have the required Calculus pre-requisite are encouraged to contact Professor Chacon for a possible pre-requisite waiver.

The course is divided into two parts. Part 1 studies non-cooperative game theory: Nash equilibrium in static games; extensions such as subgame perfection for dynamic games of complete information; Bayesian Nash equilibrium for static games with incomplete information; and sequential equilibrium (with refinements) for dynamic games with incomplete information. Applications to the social sciences include strategic choice of electoral platforms, collusion, lobbying, bargaining, and signaling. Part 2 studies cooperative game theory, including common solution concepts such as the core and the stable set, as well as hybrid topics such as coalition and network formation, or mechanism design. Applications include: political party formation; dynamic agenda-setting; the construction and implementation of voting rules; and the study of social networks.

This course offers an accessible introduction to the principles of social scientific experimentation and its uses. All types of social science experiments are explored: laboratory experiments, survey experiments, field experiments, and the new use of &quot;lab-in-the-field&quot; experiments. The course will discuss the issues of validity and artificiality in experimentation as well as the ethical concerns involved in experimental research. Students will have the opportunity to create and design their own experiment as part of the class.

The course focuses on individual decision makers in the world of politics (citizens, voters, legislators, executives, judges) and explores how they are linked together and how their decisions shape political outcomes. Students study the formal modeling of political behavior and analyze the theories of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action). The course also explores how political institutions, such as electoral rules or the design of legislatures, can structure the interactions of these actors. The course relies on cases and examples and incorporates readings from classical and contemporary sources to illustrate how these models of political behavior and institutions can shed light on current political events.

In this course we will draw on both theory and evidence to investigate the interplay between voters&rsquo; preferences and electoral processes. We will focus on the current academic literature as well as elections that have taken place recently. Each week we will discuss and analyze a current election. Each semester the course will also involve an in depth examination of an election taking place during the semester, taking a class trip to meet individuals involved in the election process in that country. In Spring 2016 we will study and visit the Philippines which will be having a general election in early May and also discuss the presidential nomination process which will be taking place in the United States during the semester as well.

This makes the political economy of development a central area of research. While a student with an introductory background to political economy will have familiarity with theories based on voting, this course stresses a variety of other factors, such as the security of property rights, the creation of market and non-market institutions, lobbying and rent-seeking, collective action, social conflict, corruption, and the political economy of redistribution. Examples from historical experience as well as modern developing countries are used throughout the course.

Particular emphasis is placed on the United States, although international comparisons are also present. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.

Eckstein considers the political culture approach as \"one of the two still viable general approaches to political theory and explanation&hellip;the other still being political rational choice theory.\" This course examines major approaches to political culture and their relationship to democratic development. We discuss questions of how to define political culture, how political culture can be studied, and how it relates to democratic politics and political performance. The pros and cons of the political culture approach will be discussed in the concluding session.

This class involves a careful reading and analysis of his masterpiece, The Prince, in its historical context, with a focus on its principal theme, namely how and why political leaders gain and lose power. Students also study selected portions of The Discourses. In order to understand the nature of Machiavelli&rsquo;s &quot;republicanism&quot; and how it relates to the advice and warnings he gave to princes. Our readings and discussions are supplemented by visits to Machiavelli&rsquo;s tomb in Santa Croce; the David of Verrocchio in the Bargello (a statue that Machiavelli saw every day on his way to his office); and the estate at Sant&rsquo;Andrea in Percussina, near San Casciano in Val di Pesa, where Machiavelli retired to write The Prince.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 141X Ibn Khaldun and Political Theory                                                                                         Written by the Maghrebian Muslim historian Ibn Khaldun and usually dated around 1377, the Muqaddimah is often described as the founding text of the philosophy of history and the history of civilizations. Its themes include the secular and religious sources of social solidarity, why individuals identify with their group and subordinate their interests to its norms, why they accept the authority of their political leaders, the tensions between nomadic and sedentary or desert and urban societies, organizational and tactical factors in military success, the division of labor and the economic transition from subsistence to surplus, demographic expansion and collapse, luxury and the decay of tribal solidarity in urban conglomerations, and the social conditions of scientific and artistic flourishing. The course involves a close reading of six chapters of the Muqaddimah (on general social theory, the theory of Bedouin society, the theory of political authority, the theory of urban society, the theory of economic development, and the sociology of science) and draws upon Western political and social theorists, such as Adam Smith and Emile Durkheim, for clarification and perspective.

In John Rawls&rsquo;s words, justice &ldquo;is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient or well-&shy;\u2010arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.&rdquo; To what extent are our contemporary social, political, and economic institutions just? How would we know?  In this course, we explore three fundamental questions about the ideal of a just society and what place the values of liberty and equality occupy in such a society:  1. Which liberties must a just society protect? Liberty of expression? Liberty of religion? Sexual liberty? Economic liberty? Political liberty?  2. What sorts of equality should a just society ensure? Equality of opportunity? Of economic outcome? Political equality? Equality for different religious and cultural groups?  3. Can a society ensure both liberty and equality? Or are these warring political values?

Following an overview session about global and regional patterns, each of the subsequent weeks will tackle a series of key gender and politics topics in turn. The course goes beyond gender inequality in the labor market to explore patterns of violence and political participation, among others. Lastly, the course provides basis for research, practical action and policy formulation and for evaluating directions and strategies for social change from a gender perspective.

POLSC-AD 150 Introduction to Comparative Politics                                             This course introduces students to the study of comparative politics and the study of domestic political institutions around the world. The course emphasizes the use of theory and evidence to generate and test hypotheses about both the causes and the consequences of the observed variation in domestic political institutions. For example, the course investigates the factors that lead some countries to democratize, and others to institute authoritarian governments, as well as the consequences of those institutional choices for policy outcomes. The course also looks at the variations in institutional arrangements within both democratic and non-democratic governments.

For decades the Arab Middle East has been largely impervious to the process of democratization. This had led to a widespread academic and journalistic perception of &quot;Arab exceptionalism&quot;. This course explores the dynamics of authoritarianism and democracy in the Arab region, the weight of its professional and entrepreneurial middle classes, and the role of youth and the unemployed in maintaining or challenging the regime. We examine the organization of the state, including the military and the intelligence services, the interrelation of political organization with economic change, and the distribution of wealth. The course seeks to link the Arab Middle East to broader questions of political organization and accountability.    Recommended Prerequisites: Introduction to Comparative Politics (POLSC-AD 150).

These are some of the questions that this course addresses, with a primary focus on India and a secondary focus on Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Burma, and Bhutan. Although students learn a vast number of facts about the history and politics of the region, the primary purpose of the course is to identify overarching patterns that characterize the politics of these regions&mdash;and to teach students to think analytically and comparatively about these patterns.

With regard to the EU, classical governance issues of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making are both sharply drawn and the subject of explicit agreements between states. These same issues were explicitly confronted in the recent past by those involved in democratization and democratic consolidation central and eastern Europe. Western Europe is the intellectual \"home\" to many of the classical models of popular representation and accountable elite decision-making, yet all countries, and especially smaller countries, are now forced to adapt these models in a setting where the traditional notion of the \"stand alone\" nation-state is becoming ever less relevant.

POLSC-AD 159X Public Policy Challenges in the Middle East                                                                                         Public policy is a major facet of the political economy of states and societies. It comprises the instruments by which public authorities shape incentives to push and prod their societies and economies in desired directions. This course has two main objectives: to introduce students to major policy issues that face virtually all political systems and to understand them through the prism of Arab politics and society. Successful political systems are those that adjust best and most quickly to unexpected reactions to specific incentives. In the Arab Middle East political authorities in several regimes have relied on implicit social contracts to hold their populations politically inactive. Since the winter of 2011 social contract incentives have broken down, and no Arab regime has successfully coped with the break down. This course considers the subsequent public policy challenges.

POLSC-AD 160J Social Media and Political Participation                                                        In recent years, social media usage (Facebook, Twitter, Linked In, Tumbler, etc.) has exploded to such an extent that it is impossible to believe it does not have an effect on the political behavior of citizens. The question remains, though, of how exactly does it matter? This is the focus of our course. In the morning sessions, student are first introduced to the most important topics of political behavior&mdash;voting, turnout, partisanship, public opinion formation, and protests and social movements&mdash;and then to the much newer literature on the usage of social media. In the afternoon sessions, students both visit social media companies located in New York City, and are taught the necessary tools to work on their own original research projects. These research projects are conducted in conjunction with NYU&rsquo;s new Social Media and Political Participation laboratory (smapp.nyu.edu).    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 161 Comparative Politics of Africa                                             The goal of this course is to introduce participants to the study of African politics from multiple methodological approaches and in a number of African contexts. The course begins with the historical roots of contemporary African politics, exploring how pre-colonial institutions and colonialism shaped African politics at independence. Then, we survey the political and economic strategies of leaders post-independence and the factors shaping those strategies. We examine the causes and consequences of poor governance, and evaluate the recent patterns of redemocratization on the continent. The course closes with a discussion of present-day challenges: electoral malfeasance, public health crises, the &ldquo;new&rdquo; populism, and China in Africa.    * Recommended prerequisite: POLSC-AD 150.

We are especially concerned with analytically exploring major issues in international politics, such as the causes of war, the emergence of cooperative trade relations between states, the origins and functioning of international organizations such as the United Nations, and the political determinants of financial crises. The focus of the course is neither historical nor descriptive; rather, it requires students to exercise skills in logic and to think of imaginative ways to apply subtle techniques to gain a clearer grasp of the above political issues.

This is a matter, not of morality, but of national security. Thanks to globalization, the poisons which brew inside weak or failing states can now infect neighbors, or countries halfway across the globe; the terrorist attacks of 9/11 reinforced this lesson with terrible force. But is it really possible for outsiders to help build solid economic and political structures in fragile states? Is &quot;democracy promotion&quot; a contradiction in terms? Experience in places like Afghanistan or Haiti is hardly encouraging. The class asks what can be done, and by whom, and in what kind of setting. We visit UN officials in New York and government officials in Washington, as well as experts in both places.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 177 Civil Wars and International Intervention                                                                   Civil war continues to be one of the most vexing problems in comparative and international politics. Why do civil wars break out? Aside from the obvious physical destruction caused by civil conflict what are the effects of civil conflict on society? How can the international community help end civil conflicts? We address these questions in this course. The course is broken into two parts starting with the causes of civil conflict, then moving on to what, if anything, the international community can do to ameliorate this problem.

How do insurgencies arise? Why do people join insurgent movements? What strategies do insurgent movements pursue? What can states do to address insurgent movements most effectively? This course addresses these questions. It begins with a review of the scholarly literature on insurgency. Students then travel to Kathmandu, Nepal to meet with participants in Nepal's 10-year civil war from 1996 to 2006 and learn their perspectives on these questions obtained from their experiences.

We will study how political conflicts impact economic development, using examples from Latin America&rsquo;s rich political and economic history to better understand the conflict-development relationship. The course will follow a seminar format and students will be encouraged to compare the conflict-development relationship in Latin America with that of their own country, and come up with explanations for differences between the two. The course will include multiple field trips to significant sites for Argentina&rsquo;s political conflicts.    *Note: Students in the NYUNY Politics Dept: This course counts for Politics in the Comparative Politics Politics field                                                                       January 2014                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                                      January 2015                                                                                         Shanker Satyanath                                                                                        Taught in Buenos Aires, Argentina                                          This course appears in...

The industrial revolution initially occurred in locations where coal was available. The discovery of oil, which provided a more transportable and more powerful source of energy, launched international competition for control of sources of oil. Oil cartels and powerful transnational oil companies have played vital roles in the politics, economics, and international policies of developed and developing nations, and access to oil has shaped the relationship of the Middle East to the world from the early 20th century to the present. This course explores these historical developments and considers how the need for energy has defined domestic politics and world developments over the past two centuries. Taking advantage of our location in Abu Dhabi, the course explores the relationship of an oil-producing region to the rest of the world.

The course will consider the emerging &quot;market&quot; or economic discussion, reviewing what academics, the press, financial institutions, etc., mean when they speak of these countries, with acronyms such as BRICs, BRICS, MINT, and others. What is the key factor: size, growth, novelty, potential or promise? Which of all of these questions is truly relevant and important? The second part of the class will examine regional, geopolitical issues: are these countries important actors in their regions? Why or why not, and how does their economic performance influence their regional political action (domestic ideological and institutional issues would also be rapidly addressed here)? The third part of the class will turn to international and multilateral factors: are &quot;emerging powers&quot; truly powers? Are they all the same? Do others see them as powers? How do they express their economic success or geographic and demographic clout in the international arena?    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

POLSC-AD 184 UN: Negotiation towards A New Binding &amp; Universal Agreement on Climate Change in Paris in Dec 2015                                                                   The United Nations (UN) provides the forum where states come together to discuss mutual problems. In our rapidly globalized world, the enormous and complex challenges to humankind are making UN indispensable. This course will provide an overview of the various UN departments and programs encompassed within it and treaty negotiation process. The main concentration of this course will remain climate change negotiations. We will take climate change as a case study and consider many aspects of international policy response to this environmental and social crisis. The purpose of this course is to provide students with a general understanding of how climate change issues have been addressed at the UN. The class will be invited to study ongoing process of the new climate change agreement, which will be adopted in Paris in December 2015, at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21). The meeting will mark a decisive stage in negotiations on the future international agreement on a post-2020 regime. The course will closely investigate the pertinent challenges currently facing diplomats and international decision makers in making progress with what is currently on the negotiating table. We will try to seek the answer of the following questions: Will all the nations of the world, including the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases, be bound by a universal agreement on climate change for the first time in over 20 years of UN negotiations? Will it take the form of a protocol, another legal instrument or &#39;an agreed outcome with legal force&#39;, and will it be applicable to all Parties including US and China? In a treaty negotiation simulation, the students will play the roles of major green house gas emitting nations and will negotiate proposals to reduce emissions. The in-class negotiation exercise will be modeled on the real negotiations under the UNFCCC.

Students learn to manage and analyze such data and to deploy statistical techniques that are common in these applications, with an emphasis on how to translate social science theory into empirical research. Topics include review of basic regression analysis, building multivariate analytical models, and regression analysis with limited dependent variables. The course emphasizes practical training in these skills as well as evaluation, replication, and critical analysis of research conducted in the social science literature. The course assumes knowledge of the material covered in Statistics for Social and Behavioral Sciences and is designed as alternative for students in the social sciences who are not taking Introduction to Econometrics.

PSYCH-AD 100 Introduction to Linguistics                                             This course offers an introduction to linguistics, the scientific study of language. The focus of linguistics within the cognitive sciences is to understand how it is that humans are able to speak and understand natural language, how they acquire this ability, and how they put it to use. The ability to speak and understand language is unique to humans and universally represented within the species. It affords us, together with other faculties of the mind, the ability to achieve levels of abstract thinking as well as social organization, which is unprecedented in the animal kingdom. Language is therefore one of the most characteristic features that we have as a species, and its study is of central importance to understanding what it is to be human.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

This course provides a better understanding of how we humans perceive and think about ourselves and about the world. This is relevant to psychology because our perception and thought processes are fraught with biases that nonetheless routinely inform human actions. Knowing about these biases and understanding their effects is crucial in a world in which human societies are becoming increasingly more interconnected. The course covers perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision-making, while emphasizing how psychologists use experiments to learn about the structure of the human mind, including how the mind and human thinking works, with all its successes and pitfalls.

It focuses on developmental processes and milestones from infancy through adolescence. Lectures interweave theory, methods, and findings about how we develop as perceiving, thinking, and feeling beings. The course covers physical development, cognitive processes, social and emotional development, language development, family contexts, risk and resilience, and nature/nurture issues. The course will explore the origins and development of human knowledge in the individual child with a focus on two core domains: knowledge of the physical world and knowledge of the social world. Within each domain, the course focuses on experimental data from developmental psychology but also draws on evidence from other disciplines, including comparative psychology, behavioral ecology, and cultural anthropology.

Because humans are fundamentally social animals, understanding social psychology is important for understanding human psychology more generally. This course provides a comprehensive survey of research and theory in the psychology of social behaviors, emotions, motivations, and cognitions of individuals, including the study of perceiving others, attitude formation, decision making, group processes, altruism and helping, aggression, social influence, the self, attraction, affiliation, moral thought and action, and intergroup relations.

Through exposure to NYUAD faculty research, students will identify potential areas of interest for their own capstone research, and over the course of the semester develop and put into writing an in-depth biology capstone proposal. The final capstone proposal is due at the end of the seminar so that students can begin the Capstone Project by the fall semester of their senior year.    Beginning in 2014-15 all science majors are expected to take this course in the junior year; it will be offered every semester.

We will begin with Freud&rsquo;s discovery of the psychoanalytic method in Studies on Hysteria and Piaget&rsquo;s classical essay on methods in The Child&rsquo;s Conception of the World. We will then read contemporary reflections on the challenges of psychological inquiry, including what modes of listening create trust, how to address the complexity of people&rsquo;s inner lives, and the cultural context of research. Research begins with a question, and the students will be asked to pose a &ldquo;real question,&rdquo; meaning something they don&rsquo;t know but want to know, and to conduct an interview with someone who might help them to answer their question. The Listening Guide method will be taught to illustrate a way of listening for and analyzing the psychological logic of an interview transcript or text.    * Note: This course is available for all students but will not count towards the Psychology major or Concentration.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

In physics, disturbances generate waves that are associated with the transmission of light and sound. These same waves generate responses in living organisms as sensory systems detect them, including nerves in some species. Electromagnetic waves, interactions among light, matter, and living systems are examined. Change during the growth of cells is explored at the molecular level as well. Laboratory exercises fuse physics, chemistry, and biology as students engage in projects related to recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning, and protein synthesis and characterization.

This is embodied in physics and chemistry in quantum theory and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. But living systems provide countless examples of oscillatory events that possess inherent uncertainty when scientists try to predict outcomes. Indeed, this final chapter in Foundations of Science challenges students to consider the very nature of studying complex problems and systems and assessing the uncertainty associated with the scientific method. The laboratory exercises involve collaborative projects in which teams of students must apply their acquired knowledge and skills to design experiments focused on answering a question or solving a problem, keeping uncertainty in mind as they report their results and discuss additional data that would be need to provide a better answer or solution.

SOCSC-AD 101 Mathematics for Social Sciences I                                                                   This course provides an introduction to topics in mathematics immediately relevant for social scientists beginning their studies in Economics, Political Science, or Social Research and Public Policy. Beginning with a review of sets and functions, the course covers key topics in univariate calculus and introduces the notation associated with basic linear algebra. The course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course provides an introduction to mathematics as the lingua franca of modern social sciences, and focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences.    *Note: This course is only open to students who started before 2015.

SOCSC-AD 113 Statistics and Probability for the Social Sciences                                                                                                                  The fundamental concepts of probability and the theoretical underpinnings of statistical inference form the foundation for data analysis in the social sciences. To this end, this course is designed to give students a rigorous foundation to both classical/Frequentist and Bayesian approaches to both probability and inference. We begin the semester with the axioms of probability, from which we develop the notions of distributions, random variables, random samples, and large sample theory. After this, we look at both Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian approaches to point/interval estimation and hypothesis testing. The course will end with an inference-based look at linear regression.    *Prerequisites: Calculus (MATH-AD 110) or Calculus with Applications (MATH-AD 111) or Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101)    *Required for Economics majors in the theory track; other students with a focus on quantitative analysis are encouraged to take SOCSC-AD 113 instead of Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences (SOCSC-AD 110). This can be used as a substitute for SOCSC-AD 110.

SOCSC-AD 201 Mathematics for Social Sciences II                                                        Building on Calculus or Mathematics for Social Scientists I, this course provides a further reaching study of mathematics immediately relevant for social science majors. Beginning with a review of univariate calculus and optimization, the discussion moves to the basics of linear algebra, multivariate calculus and tools related to the constrained optimization of functions. The last set of topics includes introductions to comparative statics and discrete-time dynamic optimization. Note that this course is not a study of pure mathematics and so results are presented without rigorous proofs. Instead, the course focuses on employing mathematics to formulate and communicate theories within the social sciences, and illustrates the usefulness of mathematical results directly in terms of applications to models of optimizing agents.   *Prerequisites: Mathematics for Social Scientists I (SOCSC-AD 101) or Calculus (MATH-AD 110 ) or Calculus with Applications 1 (MATH-AD 111)                                                                      Fall 2013 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Maximilian Mihm                                           -             TR, 9:55-11:10 AM                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Pablo Hernandez-Lagos                                           -             MW, 2:35-3:50 PM (Sem1)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 1:10-2:25 PM (Sem2)                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2014 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 3:35-4:50                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 9:15-10:30 am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Spring 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Jonathan Rogers                                           -             TR, 10:40-11:55 am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                                      Fall 2015 ;             14 Weeks                                                                                                   Olivier Bochet                                           -             MW, 9:15-10:30 am                                                                                Taught in Abu Dhabi                                          This course appears in...

This course surveys (a) the history of the capitalist system from Dutch and British hegemony through the American 20th century, the growth of corporations, various approaches to economic development, and the current opening up of the world to new economic powers, and (b) the related political history of European colonialism, nationalism, postcolonial societies, the Cold War, and the emerging multipolar world of today. It considers the nature of crises and social change, efforts to establish stability in the face of conflicts and disruptions, and possible futures open to the contemporary world.

They are perceived as &lsquo;social problems&rsquo; and divide public opinion about the appropriate ways to protect society from their deleterious effects. Lectures first focus on sociological perspectives on social problems and examine the role of social structure and social processes in their production and reproduction. Subsequent lectures focus on exploring selected social problems such as: suicide, suicide terrorism, euthanasia, aging, genocide, incest, genomics, and religious fundamentalism. The selected social problems are examined in a global perspective, focusing on contemporary industrialized societies.

After critically examining what might be meant by Islam and Muslims in the first place, students will use social scientific case studies to investigate how Islam does (or does not) come to matter in various sectors of society, including government and the state, the legal system, politics and social movements, gender relations, sexuality, education, the economy, popular culture, and everyday life. By the end of this course, students will be able to critically analyze the ways that religious and cultural Islam can impact society and social life.

How can education be used as a tool to promote global social justice and prosperity? This course explores these questions by first examining various theoretical perspectives on globalization, then analyzing several major themes associated with globalization and education. Case studies from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and North America provide concrete examples of how global forces are changing the content and context of education internationally.

SRPP-AD 114 Global Ghetto: from Venice to Gaza                                  This seminar traces the birth and spread of the ghetto as a social form and as an idea from the early modern era to the present. It begins in Venice with the first community to carry that name, and ends with Gaza, a place which the United Nations Special Rapporteur for the Situation of Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories has argued evokes the worst historic memories of ghettoization. Along the way we explore the early modern Jewish ghettos of Frankfurt, Prague and Rome; Nazi-controlled ghettos in Poland during World War II; Jewish immigrant ghettos of early 20th-century New York and Chicago; and Black ghettos in northern U.S. cities from World War II to the present. Efforts to generalize to gay communities, Chinatowns, and barrios are also considered. As we trace the spread of the ghetto idea across history, we ask: what is it about this 16th century concept, coined for a now obsolete Jewish residential area, that continues to concern and captivate us?

This course provides an introduction to the major discoveries in the field of social networks, particularly advances during the last decade. It also provides students with an introduction to the methods and software used to analyze and visualize social networks. Topics include the small-world puzzle (six degrees of separation), the strength of weak ties, centrality, complexity, thresholds (&lsquo;tipping points&rsquo;), and the spread of diseases and fads. Case studies used in the course include topics such as the contagion of suicides, social influence on musical taste, sexual relationships among adolescents, interorganizational networks, and the network structure of the internet. Course readings are an engaging blend of popular social science texts, journal articles, and scientific papers.

What social theories better explain these exuberant, extraordinary events? How did the revolutionaries, their strategies, and programs evolve during the modern epoch? What typically happened after taking power? Why are there so many wars and revolutionary dictatorships? This course introduces the recent theoretical advances in understanding contentious mass politics in relation to the formation of modern states, democratization, socialism, and nationalism. Empirical examples include: the American Independence of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1789; the communist revolutions in Russia and China; the anti-colonial movements of the 20th century in India, South Africa and Cuba; and the youth revolts of 1968 in the West, 1979 in Iran, 1989 in the Soviet bloc, and the newest rebellions of the 2010s in the Middle East.

SRPP-AD 117 Religion and Society                                             In this seminar, students explore the diverse and dynamic manifestations of religion in social life&mdash;as a personal and collective experience, an individual and group identity, and a code for moral behavior&mdash;and examine how these social uses of religion impact various spheres of society. After considering classic social theories of religion, we will look at substantive cases from the United States, Egypt, Iran, China, and Venezuela to investigate how and why religious meanings and identities come to matter (or not) in arenas of gender equality, political mobilization, nation-state structures, everyday intergroup interactions, and the law and punishment. Overall, this course aims to provide students with the theoretical frameworks and substantive background necessary to analyze the workings of religion and religious identity in modern societies.

The course is practice oriented: we will use a lot of examples, you will create your own survey design, and we will spend more than a quarter of the course learning Stata. At the end of this course you will be able to design and implement your own, high quality survey. Moreover, you will question much of the data that is collected by others because you know all the things that can go wrong in the process. For this course I assume that you are comfortable with basic statistics. This course may be substituted with a Methods Elective course.    Prerequisites: SOCSC-AD 112 and (SOCSC-AD 110 or SOCSC-AD 113 or MATH-AD 150).

While there is no uniform consensus yet, most sociologists emphasize the social constructedness of race and the dynamism of ethnicity. Sociologists question whether either term captures any objective or enduring reality, and choose instead to highlight historical and geographic variations in how the concepts play out in real life. Much social science research lends considerable empirical support to our notions about the dynamic nature and social constructedness of both ideas. In this course, we will focus on the socio-political development of early as well as reigning ideas about race AND the racialization uses to which ethnic differences have been put by those vested in creating and maintaining racial orders. This course is inherently comparative, but will draw most extensively from research and theories derived from the study of those societies in which racialization has been key to national development. This course connects ideas about race and ethnicity to patterns of assimilation, citizenship, class formation, state formation, empire, economic development, and stratification.

The first part of the seminar introduces the classical and contemporary writings on the rise of entrepreneurial capitalism in the West and the global diffusion of modern entrepreneurial spirit and firm. Classical approaches pioneered the study of modern entrepreneurship in its rational  orientation to profit-making through innovative activity. Contemporary approaches shift the emphasis away from analysis of individual attributes and agency to focus on examining the role of social networks, organizational forms, and institutional environment in facilitating entrepreneurial activity. In the part of the seminar, we focus on research on entrepreneurship using secondary sources and data available through the internet.

SRPP-AD 123 Science and Society                                             Social scientists who study science often make a simple, but controversial claim: that science is fundamentally shaped by social forces. This premise challenges contemporary understanding of science as producing true, objective knowledge that is independent of culture and social structure. We study debates about the nature of science versus religion, Western versus non-Western knowledge, and the physical versus social sciences in order to form our own conclusions about the relationship between science and society.

However, how gender is organized varies between societies and across time. This course draws upon research from sociology, economics, psychology, and anthropology to examine gender, providing information on how gender is organized in various parts of the world. Topics include how male and female children are socialized, women&rsquo;s and men&rsquo;s roles in the family, trends in women&rsquo;s education and employment, the sex gap in pay, and how gender is affected by public policies.

Using New York City as our laboratory, we explore some of the ways in which wealth and power are created and maintained, as well as examining some of the social consequences of high levels of inequality for families and communities. Readings and lectures explore the social and political economy of inequality through the work of contemporary social science. We will deepen our understanding of key issues through field trips, films, guest lectures, and meetings with key leaders in the world of finance and business, government, and nongovernmental groups working to alleviate some of the most serious consequences of poverty and inequality in New York.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

Human rights have a history that is national, regional, and international. Part I of the course presents an overview of the theory, history, and legal frameworks of the international human rights movement. Part II will explore these themes through the lens of the Argentinian experience. Students will study human rights violations during the Dirty War and national and international responses that sought to expose abuses, marshal human rights institutions to take action against them. We also will examine efforts within Argentina over the last 30 years to balance reconciliation and accountability for past abuses. In Part III, we will examine current human rights challenges facing governments, civil society groups, international organizations, and businesses today. The course will include field trips around Buenos Aires and guest speakers with direct experience in the human rights movement in Argentina.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

But in the Middle East states and national cultures are at the same time ancient and recently created.

The first section of the course provides a philosophical foundation for debates about women, work, and difference based on feminist theories. In particular, we will explore postcolonial perspectives on feminism and difference, feminist Marxist critiques of capitalism, and feminist Islamist critiques of modernity. The second part of the course provides an overview of how women in the Gulf feature in contemporary discourses as participants in &ldquo;globally competitive&rdquo; economies, mothers of &ldquo;future generations of citizens&rdquo;, and symbols of &ldquo;tradition and culture&rdquo;. The third part of the course provides an overview of the public policy and legal frameworks shaping women&rsquo;s work. In particular, this section of the course explores how different categories of &ldquo;women&rdquo; are produced through public policy programs such as workforce nationalization, education policy, social policy, and the interplay of national and international laws governing domestic work, human trafficking, and domestic abuse. The course will host a number of academics, activists, and policymakers involved in policies shaping women&rsquo;s work experiences in the Gulf.

It begins with an exploration of theoretical and conceptual perspectives on urbanization and welfare state policies, then moves on to examine illustrative cases from global north and south cities that challenge and complicate reigning theories and concepts. The course begins with an historical and contemporary analysis of urban poverty in Global North cities (New York, Paris and London), then moves on to an examination of emergent urban poverty patterns and cases in rapidly-changing &ldquo;semi-peripheral&rdquo; regions (China, for example), and finally explores urban poverty in a wide variety of Global South cities (spanning Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia). The course will use examples from the U.S. to explore certain key topics/concepts for debate, such as &ldquo;underclass,&rdquo; &ldquo;informality,&rdquo; &ldquo;feminization of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;culture of poverty,&rdquo; &ldquo;prison industrial complex,&rdquo; and &ldquo;neo-liberal welfare state retrenchment.&rdquo; Students will be asked to compare and contrast historical and contemporary patterns of urban poverty across global north and south regions, with a focus on the limits and possibilities of social policies (state- and non-state-sponsored) for addressing urban distress.

This course focuses on two major and interrelated themes: climate change and energy. The class will look at implications of new climate change and renewable energy mandates for the electric power sector. Energy is considered a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty alleviation. Electricity demand almost doubled from 1990 to 2011, and is projected to grow 81% from 2011 to 2035 in the existing policies scenario. Over 70% of the increased energy demand is from developing countries. At this time some two billion people (one third of world&rsquo;s population) have no access to electricity. Population growth (United Nations predicts world population growth from 6.7 billion in 2011 to 8.7 billion by 2035) and increasing standards of living (the UN Population Division projects 70 % people will be living in urban areas by 2050) for many people in developing countries will cause enormous growth in energy demand. Many poorer countries lack this essential capacity. Meeting the energy needs of developing countries without compromising the environment is a challenge. Advancement of innovative energy solutions and implementation of smart policies to make the transition to clean energy in ways that fulfill growing needs and improve economy without hurting environment is very much needed. This introductory level course on renewable energy examines the historical and legal origins of energy regulations and emerging policies. The course provides an introduction to the renewable sources and basic terms and concepts, regulatory trends and other emerging issues. The primary focus of the course will be on renewable energy policies and laws of the developing countries. We will spend considerable time with Africa, Small Island States, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and examples from other countries. The centerpiece of this course is to focus on a specific renewable energy project (in a developing country) completed with international cooperation and assistance. The course will also focus on global institutions and policymaking, the divide between industrialized countries and developing countries, the nexus between global climate change and renewable energy, sustainable energy sources, and challenges that global policymakers will face in future. The course will look at the wide variety of local and regional laws, regulatory techniques, and policy objects. The class will embark on a week- long trip to a developing country to study renewable energy project and to get hands-on experience of power generation from a renewable energy facility.    * Note: This course will be counted towards a Political Science elective (International Politics) only for Spring 2015.

What we eat, how we recycle, or when we disclose personal information on the internet are all examples of choices largely determined by public policies. This course is an introduction to public policy, why it is important, and how it involves simultaneous ethical, political, and problem-solving processes. The course introduces students to the ways in which a variety actors and institutions at the national and transnational levels interactively contribute to public policy. The course is divided into two parts. The first part provides an overview of the basic concepts underlying the public policy process and the second part provides critical perspectives on public policy-making in theory and practice.

This course introduces students to the main concepts of the public health field and the critical links between global health and social and economic development. Lectures explore major themes in global health, including the social determinants of health, the global distribution of disease burden and risk factors, key measures to address the disease burden in cost-effective ways, and the role of health systems and diverse global actors in responding to the health needs of populations worldwide. The course is global in coverage, but with a focus on low- and middle-income countries and on the health of the poor.

Acting and performance are central to the process, but so is the recognition that a performance takes place in a space that has to be invested with rules and conventions before it can tell a story. Exploring the possibilities offered by these rules and conventions is key to understanding the potential for theater as a means of expression and mode of knowledge. Combining the tools and techniques of Aristotle, Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, Brecht, Grotowski, Brook, and Bogart, students work in groups to devise and stage silent stories as well as textual scenes to explore what it means to create a theatrical experience. All students participate as directors, actors, designers, and audience, and discuss each other&rsquo;s work in order to develop a clearer and more objective relationship to their own.

The course introduces key terms and methodologies for understanding performance as an object of analysis and a means of expressive behavior. We explore how particular theories of drama emerge at historical moments and why; we do so by looking at those theories embodiment on the stage, in dramatic literature, in public, and in everyday life. The aim of this class is to provide a performance vocabulary that will serve as a foundation and framework for advanced studies. Although this is not a survey of theatre history, the course will draw from a wide variety of historical plays and performances to elucidate the critical concerns of the field.

We engage the body as an expressive tool in support of artistic craft and technique and build confidence in our ability to translate creative impulses through physical action. The course guides the student through awareness of and release from habitual tensions and into body alignment, breathing, resonators, sound and movement, group interaction, and the exploration of individual and group creativity. We focus on the kinetic application of movement in the art-making process, using core energy, dynamics, breath connection, strength, flexibility, range of motion, stamina, and relaxation techniques in order to strengthen our creative output. The goal is a free voice in a free body and the ability to express thought and emotion with openness and truth.

THEAT-AD 115 Directing the Actor                                                                                         A course for theater directors, filmmakers, actors, and visual artists. Students build a directorial vocabulary for translating impulse and imagination into compelling narrative and non-narrative staged moments. Using techniques from Brecht, Brook, Grotowski, and Bogart, students learn to articulate ideas to actors in compelling and inspiring ways. Students explore physical exercises to increase their range as directors; tools with which to fuel actors physically and emotionally; and theories of collaboration and ensemble. The core of the class is the exploration of directing as a physical collaboration with actors within a landscape of thought, emotion, openness, and truth.

THEAT-AD 134JX Theater in the Arab World                                                                                         This class examines recent trends in contemporary Arab theatre, contextualizing these within a broader history of Arab performance including film. Particular attention is given to how experimental practitioners have explored issues of human rights and the control of territories under the modern state. Strategies addressed include: the conflation of past and present as a means of exploring the persistence of the colonial power structure in the modern Arab world (Wannus&rsquo;s Historical Miniatures, &lsquo;Udwan&rsquo;s The Trial of the Man Who Didn&rsquo;t Fight); the use of parable to speak truth to power (Wannus&rsquo;s The Elephant, Diyab&rsquo;s Strangers Don&rsquo;t Drink the Coffee); the incorporation of populist entertainment forms that directly engage the audience (a-Sadiki&rsquo;s use of the halqa and Wannus&rsquo; inclusion of hekoatee); and the use of familiar tales to explore new political realities (Wannus&rsquo;s and Farag&rsquo;s use of the Arabian Nights Tales, Al-Hakim&rsquo;s use of pharaonic myth, Al-Hakim and Salim&rsquo;s use of Greek myth).

From a variety of critical theoretical discourses, our discussions focus on the theatrical practices demanded by the texts, along with the intersections and divergences of structures and topics shared by continental plays, such as blackness and race, exile, colonialism and post-colonialism, violence, gender inequality, family, moral and social values, interraciality, religion, and political resistance. The plays from North Africa that align with the Arab world will serve as a bridge to introduce noteworthy works from the African diaspora, with plays written by Africans or those of African ancestry living in the Middle East, Europe, and the United States.

THEAT-AD 152 Art, Performance, and Social Practice                                                        How do we begin to know each other differently from the way in which dominant social systems and communicative technologies structure our daily interactions? This question drives art and performance&rsquo;s &ldquo;social turn&rdquo; to real-world collaborations between artists and performers who act in the role of instigators or catalysts with the communities around them. The social turn explicitly rejects the artist&rsquo;s more traditional role as the producer of a consumable aesthetic object or theatrical performance and instead proposes that the conscious processes of collaborative engagement -- activist, participatory, coauthored &ndash; must be understood and valued as art. In this intertwining of art with performance, cooperative processes are foregrounded as frameworks to understand and shift the impact of political and social policy, architecture, art history, urban planning, and new media on our lives. The social practice of art proposes that in making encounters where artists engage with the members of communities as &ldquo;expert participants,&rdquo; we might construct more livable alternatives through social cooperation. Art as social practice also insists that this process is an aesthetic practice. In this course we will read recent critical theories and histories of the aesthetics and politics of the social practice of art, explore case studies of &ldquo;relational art,&rdquo; and collaborate on our own &ldquo;living as form&rdquo; project.

We&rsquo;ll critique the plays as both literature and dramatic texts intended for production. What is clearly evident in African women playwrights&rsquo; writing is its focus on women&rsquo;s agency; generational legacies; tradition, colonialism, and modernism; tribal and national identities; family relationships; intimacy and commitment; the spirit world of rituals, polytheism, and monotheism; the challenging coexistence between Christianity and Islam; the impact of the global diaspora on African identity; and the intersecting issues of blackness, Africanness, and womanhood. The course will address these various foci through the works of Andiah Kisia (Kenya), Nathalie Etoke, Werewere Liking (Cameroon), Tsitsi Dangarembga (Zimbabwe), Fatima Gallaire (Algeria), Penina Mlama, Amadina Lihamba (Tanzania), Ama Ata Aidoo, Efua Sutherland (Ghana), Osonye Tess Onwueme, Zulu Sofola, Julie Okoh (Nigeria), Sindiwe Magona, Malika Ndlovu, Gcina Mhlope (South Africa), Violet Barungi, and Deborah Asiimwe (Uganda). The foundational critical theories for the course are postcolonialism, feminism, critical race theory, and diasporic studies. We will also engage the new plays by African women that are produced at the 2nd Annual Kampala International Theatre Festival (Nov 25-29, 2015) through the assistance of award-winning Ugandan playwright, Deborah Asiimwe, who is co-director of this East African theatre festival (as well as the representative for the Sundance Institute East Africa).

Training exercises are used to develop kinesthetic awareness, focus, listening, character, action, creativity, imagination, and collaboration. Through a holistic approach connected to recent findings in cognitive science, students build technical craft as well as begin to remove obstructive physical, vocal and mental habits, so as to release the full potential of the responsiveness, expressivity, and presence of their actor/performer instruments: the body-mind.    *Prerequisites are: THEAT-AD 110 Fundamentals of Acting OR THEAT-AD 111 Body at Work: Voice and Movement for the Artist    Students in the NYUNY Drama Dept: This course counts as an elective credit towards the major .

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required.

It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.

VISAR-AD 110 Drawing By Seeing                                                                              This workshop class is open to all levels of artistic experience. The premise is that customary perception (drawing what you &ldquo;know&rdquo;) is in conflict with aesthetic perception (drawing what you actually &ldquo;see&rdquo;). Each exercise reinforces an essential principle such as: &ldquo;the whole is greater than the sum of its parts&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic perception results in an integrated, dynamic drawing.&rdquo; Students learn how to maintain a unified drawing while at the same time articulate detail. Later sessions address how to apply this experience to individual artistic goals. There are PowerPoint discussions of relevant examples of drawing from the history of drawing.

The course begins with the origins of the medium in France, England, and the U.S. in the 1830s, and proceeds to a broader look at photography throughout the world. Photography is considered as art, medium of communication, formulator of political and propaganda concepts, advertising tool, and aspect of popular culture, and students produce a portfolio of their photographs.

Our goal is to help students develop the skills of painting and experience it as an art form rich in possibilities for the direct expression of feelings, perceptions and ideas.

VISAR-AD 118 Types of Art: From Calligraphy and Stone Carving to Digital Type                                                                              Type Design is the art and craft of designing typefaces. From calligraphy and stone carving to digital type, the history of type recounts the discoveries and technological progress made through human inventions. While some typefaces are insignificant and forgotten, others will survive mankind, such as Futura engraved on the Apollo 11 plaque, left on the Moon. Some of typefaces were revolutionary, others reactionary. But behind each of them there was an inventor. Students will follow the &#39;traces&#39; and the stories of the type masters who shaped our visual typographical landscapes. Western and Arabic versions of typefaces will be examined and students will learn to identify and combine fonts on real visual design layouts. We will see how typefaces can become visual metaphors of towns and nations - Johnston Underground is London - or marketing tools for the advertising industry. Typography and type design in the digital age will be investigated via practical exercises and printing workshops. The course will include calligraphy classes with the U.A.E. State calligrapher Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi.    Monday March 3 to Monday April 14 (6 classes during term time) will consist of a Calligraphy Course with Mohammed Mandi at the National Theater Art Workshop, Abu Dhabi from 5-8pm. This will replace the usual Monday class.

The course will examine contemporary art from the lens of conceptual art focusing on key works by international artists. Student will examine the definition/s of &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo; and the current debates around the modern and contemporary in relation to Western and non-Western art.

VISAR-AD 125 Finding The Way: Wayfinding and Graphic Design in the Built Environment                                                                   Wayfinding encompasses all of the ways in which people orient themselves via the organization and usage of sensory cues from the external environment. In visual communication studies nowadays - informed by the constant advance of technologies, the demand for sustainable models and the inputs from cognitive scientists - the concept of wayfinding has grown to the point that it has become a broad field of research in its own, encompassing interdisciplinary relationship with architecture and design.  The course will explore the visual design component of wayfinding, and include lab classes and workshops around the Saadyat Campus signage system, with specific attention to multilingual display and accessible design for people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Students will study and compare sign systems implemented in western capitals and elaborate on the application (and misapplications) of these system in the U.A.E.

VISAR-AD 126 Interventions: Three-Dimensional Thinking                                                        In this seminar we will study the new NYU Campus in Abu Dhabi and use the campus grounds as a site to develop temporary sculptural interventions in this public or semipublic space. We will begin by coming to terms with conceptualisations of sculpture since the 1960s that have understood the physical location of the work of art as a integral to our perception of it. The evolution of context-related sculpture since the 1960s led in the 1980s and 1990s to the need to distinguish between site-dominating, site-adapted, site-specific, and site-determined approaches. We will discuss the differences between them in class and ask how the interventions developed in class relate to the architectural, institutional, social, and cultural circumstances of the campus. This includes questioning what sort of public a sculptural intervention should take into account and how this public differs from the audience at an art gallery. What qualities does public space have that are distinct from those of private space and what characterizes a semipublic space? Over the course of the seminar, we will work out the basic conditions within which we will be allowed to make sculptural interventions on campus. The selected sites will be analyzed in detail.

VISAR-AD 165J Gardens of Eden in the History of Art                                                                              The garden is one of the oldest modes of human intervention in the environment. This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qu&rsquo;ran where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational figure in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the peoples of the book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and the seminar examines both. We will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline. The seminar includes field trips to gardens and collections in the UAE and India, and concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.    *Note: This course number has now been changed to VISAR-AD 102.

The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

VISAR-AD 174 Modernism: An Art Historical Introduction                                  The term modernism encompasses the activities and creations of those who have felt since the late nineteenth century that traditional forms of art, architecture, literature, religious habit, social organization and ways of living are inadequate to the realities of an industrialized world. Such activities and creations have sought to initiate an understanding of the world that would ultimately lead to new cultural, economic, social, and political environments. This has involved experimentation and, the creation of an awareness of possibilities never thought of before, as well as a sense of constant change and competition, especially in the arts. The course will provide an art historical survey from the late 19th century to the late 1960s. It will focus primarily on Europe and the United States and will explore art movements, ideas and exemplary individual artworks, but also the dynamics of art historical development as a whole.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.    *Note this course has now been changed to VISAR-AD 104.    *There are no prerequisites for this course, but VISAR-AD 166 ( now changed to VISAR-AD 102) Foundations of Art History I is recommended.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social, and cultural. Students are given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for artworks to &ldquo;read&rdquo; and how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure allows students to explore ideas of limits and how the limit or horizon of what is possible can be elaborated and expanded on in art. Students engage in group and one-on-one discussions of projects made in response to readings and assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration and consistency in a creative practice.    *Prerequistes: VISAR-AD 112, or, VISAR-AD 122, or, VISAR-AD 123, or VISAR-AD 124.

It examines in detail works of art that reflect upon tradition, aesthetic experience and art practice in complex ways and does so by situating these examinations in rich historical and theoretical frameworks. The course is open to anyone who has completed either Foundations of Art History I or II and at least one Art History elective but it is designed with Art History juniors especially in mind because the course is, in part, a useful preparation for Capstone work in the senior year. The course is a requirement for all students pursuing the Art History track.

WRIT-AD 111X Analysis and Expression: Contemporary Debates about Islam                                                        Scarcely a day goes by without some controversy or critical comment about &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; -- Muslims -- and its role and significance in the 21st century. Yet trying to make sense of the sheer volume of information and diversity of opinions about what constitutes &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;, who speaks for it, what it represents for the modern era, and how it relates to the non-Muslim world can&mdash;to the unsuspecting observer&mdash;seem an almost impossible task. To complicate matters further, what tends to pass as &lsquo;informed&rsquo; commentary on &lsquo;Islam&rsquo; often turns out to be colored by competing agendas, experiences, and narratives within and beyond the realms of &lsquo;Islam&rsquo;. With these challenges in mind, this course will revisit some of the key debates about the culture, society, and institutions of Islam, and invite students to form and defend their opinions on a range of controversial issues.    A significant feature of the course will be the focus on in-class writing as well as discussions and debate about written and audio-visual media. Over the duration of the semester, students will complete four major assignments: three persuasive essays, all with an extensive drafting process, and a final oral presentation on the subject matter of Essay 3.

WRIT-AD 130 Analysis and Expression II: Ideas of the Tragic                                             A man pokes his eyes out upon realizing he has killed his father and slept with his mother. A king returning from war finds his adulterous wife in a murdering mood, and before long he is dead. A wife betrayed by her philandering husband slaughters her two children as revenge. Tragedies portray human actions and emotions at their most extreme. What have these performances of suffering offered audiences for millennia? What social function does tragedy have? What cultural anxieties are revealed or exorcised by these spectacular representations of acute passion, rage, and pain? We begin by examining Aeschylus&rsquo;s Agamemnon and Shakespeare&rsquo;s Hamlet in a philosophical context by engaging Aristotle&rsquo;s, Hegel&rsquo;s, and George Steiner&rsquo;s philosophies of tragedy. We next explore what modern tragedy might look like through an analysis of Nuri Bilge Ceylan&rsquo;s award-winning Once Upon a Time in Anatolia, a meditation on loss, sin, and inheritance. For the research paper, students select a contemporary cultural artifact and make an argument about how it represents tragedy in the post 9/11 world. Possible topics range from online communities of mourning or the debate over how to commemorate the attacks and their consequences to the continuing influence of classical tragedy on contemporary culture in The Wire or Lars von Trier&rsquo;s Melancholia.

With the recent rise of ISIS, the emergence of the Arab Spring, and the never-ending conflict in Israel-Palestine there is every reason to believe that worldwide attention on Islam, Arabs and Muslims is likely to continue unabated. Building on &lsquo;Contemporary Debates about Islam&rsquo; this course will continue to visit some of the controversial social, political, and cultural topics of the day with particular focus on the Middle East.

WRIT-AD 210 Advanced Analysis and Expression                                             This course builds upon the skills from Analysis and Expression and the Writing-Intensive Core courses to prepare students for advanced writing across the curriculum. The course calls upon students to be creative, critical, and curious, as they rigorously practice their written and spoken expression. Students engage with a variety of texts and research topics to gain greater self-awareness and confidence with their writing. Each major assignment is the result of a progression of exercises with an emphasis on drafting and revision strategies.
