We develop a theoretical description for the spin and valley edge textures in the two phases, and the implied evolution in the nature of edge modes through the transition. In particular, we show that the CAF has gapless neutral modes in the bulk, but supports gapped charged edge modes constructed by the binding of a vortex (meron) in the bulk state to a spin twist at the edge. The energy gap of this edge mode is therefore dictated by the bulk spin stiffness. At the transition to the FM state where the latter vanishes, the charged edge modes become gapless and are smoothly connected to the helical edge modes of the FM state. We further discuss possible experimental consequences.                                              April 29, 2015 Wednesday 10:00 AM   +         Meyer 5th Fl.

Multiple copies of you might exist elsewhere in space, in time, or on other branches of the wave function. Such duplication is inevitable the Everett (Many-Worlds) formulation of quantum mechanics, and has a beneficial effect: it leads to a simple derivation of the Born Rule for quantum probabilities. Duplication can be a bad thing in cosmology, where it leads to Boltzmann Brains and the cosmological measure problem. An improved understanding of quantum fluctuations shows that Boltzmann Brains can be easily avoided if they dont correspond to decoherent branches of the wave function.

One of the key predictions of inflation is a spectrum of primordial density fluctuations that remains nearly scale-invariant over 15-25 decades in distance scale. The near scale-invariance of primordial perturbations over the roughly 3 decades over which the spectrum has been measured so far remains one of the theory's greatest successes. Still, it is interesting to think whether that spectrum can be measured over the remaining 12-22 decades, all of it at distance scales smaller than those that can be probed by the cosmic microwave background or galaxy surveys. I will discuss some ideas for accessing these smaller scales.                                          May 1, 2015 Friday 2:00 PM   +         Meyer 5th Fl.

Helioseismic data have also allowed us to study properties of stellar matter. NASA's Kepler mission has allowed us to undertake seismic studies of other stars. While the field is not yet fully developed and we are still learning the best way to analyze the data, asteroseismic studies of stars has already produced exciting results. In this talk I shall review what asteroseismology is, how we interpret asteroseismic data, and then talk about some of the exciting results obtained with data from Kepler.

While some of the questions regarding the beginning and end of the universe are well known and publicized, what it is not commonly recognized that asking fundamental questions at or above the atomic level have lead to major scientific revolutions. I will describe in this talk how condensed matter physics at sizes approaching atomic dimensions (\u201cnanostructures\u201d) is revolutionizing basic concepts in physics, chemistry and biology. When the size of a material approaches that of an atom its properties change radically. I will describe several exciting and new directions in the field of oxides, spintronics, and organic materials. The new physics evolving from this research may lead to novel applications which cannot be predicted at present, but which surely will revolutionize electronics, medicine, and engineering. This colloquium, accessible to non-experts, will be dedicated to highlighting the recent scientific advances in the field and possible new directions.

Optical properties of semiconductor microcavities are governed by bosonic quasi-particles named cavity polaritons, which are light-matter mixed states. Cavity polaritons propagate like photons, but interact strongly with their environment via their matter component. Patterning of semiconductor microcavities on a micron scale allows confining polaritons in photonic circuits or in lattices.      After a general introduction on cavity polaritons, I will illustrate the diversity of physical problems that can be addressed in this non-linear photonic system using patterned microstructures.I will show that taking advantage of the giant non-linearities induced by polariton interaction it is possible to realize photonic circuits in which coherent polaritons are propagated and optically manipulated.     The second part of the talk will be dedicated to the physics of polaritons in lattices. I will show that we can implement complex Hamiltonians and thus develop a new platform for quantum emulation. For instance, we have demonstrated a fractal energy spectrum for polaritons by engineering a quasi-periodic lattice. It becomes possible to explore the physics of non-linear wavepackets in such complex environment. Polaritons are also very promising for the investigation of graphene physics using honeycomb lattices. For instance, Dirac cones are directly imaged in the polariton far field emission. Finally we recently fabricated lattices holding non dispersive bands. In such flat bands, kinetic energy frustration dramatically modifies the spontaneous spatial coherence of polariton condensates.

High-energy emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts: advancing our knowledge on GRBs and relativistic shocks through modeling of afterglow radiation             The physical origin of the temporally extended (~10^2 sec) high-energy emission (0.1-100 GeV) detected from Gamma-Ray Bursts by the Fermi/LAT instrument has not yet been completely understood. I present the evidences in favour of the external shock scenario, where the LAT emission is interpreted as radiation from electrons accelerated at the relativistic shock developed in interactions with the external medium. I show that the modelling of LAT lightcurves not only reveals specific features consistent with the proposed interpretation, but also has predictive power on parameters entering the shock physics and the physics of the prompt emission mechanism. Extension of this study to include X-ray and optical afterglow data reveals that broadband modelling within the external shock scenario is always successful for the sample of GRBs with LAT temporally extended emission (10 events), and leads to two possibilities: either the X-ray emitting electrons (unlike the GeV emitting electrons) are in slow cooling regime or ii) the X-ray flux is strongly suppressed by Compton cooling, whereas, due to Klein-Nishina, the suppression is negligible at GeV energies. In both cases the LAT flux is a more robust proxy for the blastwave energy than the X-ray flux. On average, both cases require weak magnetic fields and relatively large blastwave energies. These large energies left in the blastwave reduce the efficiency requirements on the still uncertain mechanism responsible for prompt emission. Finally, I present preliminary results on the consistency of the external shock interpretation with the detection rate of high-energy emission from GRBs.

Processes that used to be hard are now trivial; processes that used to be impossible are now necessary. Drawing on examples from computational astrophysics and cosmology, I will describe how the commodity market for data-related services has changed the needs of the scientific community, and how this can be leveraged in the future to develop advanced, useful, and forward-thinking technologies to transform the way researchers interact with data.
