You may also submit the form via email to history.undergrad@nyu.edu .    Requirements for the History Major:       A minimum of 36 points in history (typically 9 courses) with the grade of C or better in each course. (No pass/fail courses may count towards the Major or Minor.) History 101 (HIST-UA 101)    At least 6 advanced-level history courses (course # HIST-UA 100 or above).    2 courses in each of the three geographic areas: US, European &amp; Non-Western. 1 course in each geographic area must be an advanced-level course .      1 Capstone Seminar    1 pre-1800 course    Important Guidelines:    History 101 (HIST-UA 101) Historical Interpretation         This course introduces majors to the core skills, methods, and approaches of the discipline. Beginning from Fall 2014, it now teaches this key disciplinary content, such as reading primary sources and analyzing historical arguments, through a series of case studies related to a particular theme (ie: revolutions, warfare, slavery, capitalism, etc). The goal of History 101 is to prepare our majors to succeed in more advanced seminars, including, eventually, a Capstone Seminar. History 101 will consist of both a lecture which will meet twice a week for 75 minutes; and a recitation section which will meet for 75 minutes per week.    History 101 must be taken before a Capstone Seminar in history. Students may not take HIST-UA 101 concurrent with the Capstone Seminar.    History 101 CANNOT fulfill the Geographic, seminar or pre-1800 requirements.    Transferred courses never count toward this requirement.    Introductory Courses (Below HIST-UA 100)       12 of the 36 points (3 classes) may be in introductory courses.    Introductory Courses, usually broad and general, are useful to prepare students for courses that treat subjects in more depth and detail.    Advanced Courses (HIST-UA 100 &amp; above)       All 36 points of the history major may be in advanced courses, but 24 of the 36 points (6 classes) must be in advanced courses.    Advanced courses examine themes or narrower subjects, usually over shorter periods of time, in greater depth and detail than introductory courses. Many of these courses have limited enrollments and require access codes before a student can register for them.    History 101 counts as advanced in terms of requirements.    Geographic Requirements (1 advanced course required in each area)       2 US History Courses    2 European History Courses (Eastern / Western Europe &amp; Russia)    2 Non-Western History Courses (Africa, Asia, Latin America &amp; Middle East)    Capstone Seminar (course number in the 400 range)       One Capstone Seminar is required for the history major. Students must have taken History 101 (HIST-UA 101) and be at least second-semester sophomores to enroll in a Capstone Seminar.    Seminars are designed to offer students an opportunity to discuss a series of topics or issues around a table in an intimate setting of fewer than twenty students and a faculty director. Each student is expected to undertake a research project and make an oral presentation in class about some or all aspects of the project. The professor and fellow students critique one another's work-in-progress and offer helpful suggestions and insights of their own.    At the end of the semester, the student will submit a final paper to the professor who will then assess a grade based on the quality of the paper as well as class participation throughout the semester. This is not a lecture course and normally there are no mid-term or final examinations.    The Capstone Seminar can double count towards the geographic or pre-1800 requirements, as long as the student takes 9 courses total.    Freshman Honors seminars and other seminars below HIST-UA 100 are not considered advanced-level seminars. Advanced Honors Seminars (V28, NOT V70) taught by History professors can fulfill the Capstone Seminar requirement if taken before Fall 2010.    AP Credits       For Majors, we will allow up to 4 points of AP credit provided you achieved a score of 4 or better as one INTRO history course. ( AP credit is not accepted for the minor.)    Transfer Classes       After the credits are accepted by CAS , they must be evaluated by the Assistant to the DUGS or the DUGS. A transfer student must take at least 7 history courses (28 points) in our department. 2 outside courses can be approved through the course petition process to be counted toward the major (see below).    Courses Outside of the History Department       Courses cross-listed with the history department and HIST-UA courses taken during study abroad will count towards the history major. Due to the large number of cross-listed courses if a student enrolled in a cross-listed class under the other department\u2019s course number it is the student\u2019s responsibility to prove that the course has been cross-listed (supply a syllabus or tell us the corresponding HIST-UA number).    Courses that are not cross-listed with the history department must be approved by the DUGS. Students can petition for up to two courses to count towards their major by turning in a course petition form and attached syllabus to the History Department. No course is guaranteed.    CORE (formerly MAP) Courses and Freshman Honors Seminars       CORE/MAP courses (CORE-UA &amp; MAP-UA) and Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA) can only count towards the history major if they are taught by a history professor .    CORE/MAP courses (CORE-UA &amp; MAP-UA) and Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA) can only count as introductory courses.    LSP Courses       If the major was declared BEFORE SEPTEMBER 2010, students may use three LSP courses towards their history major, Social Foundations I &amp; II and a Non-West Civilization course. These three courses will always be counted as introductory courses. The remaining 6 history classes must be advanced (HIST-UA 100 or above).    If the major was declared September 2010 or later, only two LSP may be counted toward the major: Social Foundations I and II. Students must take 6 advanced courses so only one more introductory course (below HIST-UA 100) course may be counted toward the major.    LSP students who entered CAS beginning Spring 2009 have their LSP courses averaged - indexed -in to their overall cumulative CAS GPA and into the major GPA if you count an LSP course for the history major. Students who entered CAS prior to Spring 2009 do not have their courses in LSP average in these two CAS averages.    Double Counting of Courses       Up to 2 courses may be double counted between the history major and another major or minor.    Internships (HIST-UA 980/981)       Students who wish to engage in history related work in an agency or institute within or outside New York University (ie. UN agency, an archive, museum or library, philanthropy, a publishing house or an appropriate television program) may apply to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course elective credit. Applications are available from the History office or on the website.    Interns must devote a minimum of 8 hours a week for a 4 points internship.    Internships may not be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirements but are considered as advanced history electives.    Students interested in an internship for credit must write a 250-word proposal on the nature of their internship and describe why it is historically relevant. They must submit this proposal with a letter from their internship supervisor confirming the internship and stating that they will give the student a proposed grade at the end of the semester.    The student should maintain a daily log during the internship and must submit an 8 \u2013 10 page paper at the end of the semester which can be a compilation of these daily logs or a more traditional thematic paper focusing on what was learned during the internship.    Independent Study (HIST-UA 997/998)       Independent Studies may count towards the major if they are classified as HIST-UA and do not exceed a total of 8 points. They may also be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirement upon formal approval from the DUGS. Such courses, however, cannot be counted towards satisfaction of History 101 or the Capstone Seminar.    Students interested in undertaking independent study on a specific or specialized topic of their choice may do so by applying to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course credit. Applications are available from the History office or on the website.    The student will indicate a general area of interest and will need to obtain the agreement of a faculty supervisor. The student and faculty supervisor must consult each other on a regular basis, at least biweekly, and the grade for the course must be submitted by the supervisor to the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the last week of the term in which the student is registered.    Graduate Classes (HIST-GA)       Undergraduate seniors with a history GPA of 3.5 or better may take some graduate level history courses. Consult the current course schedule and then seek permission to register from the instructor of the course and the DUGS. In a few cases, a graduate course involving a research paper may be used to fulfill the Capstone Seminar requirement.

You may also submit the form via email to history.undergrad@nyu.edu .    Requirements for the History Major:       A minimum of 36 points in history (typically 9 courses) with the grade of C or better in each course. (No pass/fail courses may count towards the Major or Minor.) History 101 (HIST-UA 101)    At least 6 advanced-level history courses (course # HIST-UA 100 or above).    2 courses in each of the three geographic areas: US, European &amp; Non-Western. 1 course in each geographic area must be an advanced-level course .      1 Capstone Seminar    1 pre-1800 course    Important Guidelines:    History 101 (HIST-UA 101) Historical Interpretation         This course introduces majors to the core skills, methods, and approaches of the discipline. Beginning from Fall 2014, it now teaches this key disciplinary content, such as reading primary sources and analyzing historical arguments, through a series of case studies related to a particular theme (ie: revolutions, warfare, slavery, capitalism, etc). The goal of History 101 is to prepare our majors to succeed in more advanced seminars, including, eventually, a Capstone Seminar. History 101 will consist of both a lecture which will meet twice a week for 75 minutes; and a recitation section which will meet for 75 minutes per week.    History 101 must be taken before a Capstone Seminar in history. Students may not take HIST-UA 101 concurrent with the Capstone Seminar.    History 101 CANNOT fulfill the Geographic, seminar or pre-1800 requirements.    Transferred courses never count toward this requirement.    Introductory Courses (Below HIST-UA 100)       12 of the 36 points (3 classes) may be in introductory courses.    Introductory Courses, usually broad and general, are useful to prepare students for courses that treat subjects in more depth and detail.    Advanced Courses (HIST-UA 100 &amp; above)       All 36 points of the history major may be in advanced courses, but 24 of the 36 points (6 classes) must be in advanced courses.    Advanced courses examine themes or narrower subjects, usually over shorter periods of time, in greater depth and detail than introductory courses. Many of these courses have limited enrollments and require access codes before a student can register for them.    History 101 counts as advanced in terms of requirements.    Geographic Requirements (1 advanced course required in each area)       2 US History Courses    2 European History Courses (Eastern / Western Europe &amp; Russia)    2 Non-Western History Courses (Africa, Asia, Latin America &amp; Middle East)    Capstone Seminar (course number in the 400 range)       One Capstone Seminar is required for the history major. Students must have taken History 101 (HIST-UA 101) and be at least second-semester sophomores to enroll in a Capstone Seminar.    Seminars are designed to offer students an opportunity to discuss a series of topics or issues around a table in an intimate setting of fewer than twenty students and a faculty director. Each student is expected to undertake a research project and make an oral presentation in class about some or all aspects of the project. The professor and fellow students critique one another's work-in-progress and offer helpful suggestions and insights of their own.    At the end of the semester, the student will submit a final paper to the professor who will then assess a grade based on the quality of the paper as well as class participation throughout the semester. This is not a lecture course and normally there are no mid-term or final examinations.    The Capstone Seminar can double count towards the geographic or pre-1800 requirements, as long as the student takes 9 courses total.    Freshman Honors seminars and other seminars below HIST-UA 100 are not considered advanced-level seminars. Advanced Honors Seminars (V28, NOT V70) taught by History professors can fulfill the Capstone Seminar requirement if taken before Fall 2010.    AP Credits       For Majors, we will allow up to 4 points of AP credit provided you achieved a score of 4 or better as one INTRO history course. ( AP credit is not accepted for the minor.)    Transfer Classes       After the credits are accepted by CAS , they must be evaluated by the Assistant to the DUGS or the DUGS. A transfer student must take at least 7 history courses (28 points) in our department. 2 outside courses can be approved through the course petition process to be counted toward the major (see below).    Courses Outside of the History Department       Courses cross-listed with the history department and HIST-UA courses taken during study abroad will count towards the history major. Due to the large number of cross-listed courses if a student enrolled in a cross-listed class under the other department\u2019s course number it is the student\u2019s responsibility to prove that the course has been cross-listed (supply a syllabus or tell us the corresponding HIST-UA number).    Courses that are not cross-listed with the history department must be approved by the DUGS. Students can petition for up to two courses to count towards their major by turning in a course petition form and attached syllabus to the History Department. No course is guaranteed.    CORE (formerly MAP) Courses and Freshman Honors Seminars       CORE/MAP courses (CORE-UA &amp; MAP-UA) and Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA) can only count towards the history major if they are taught by a history professor .    CORE/MAP courses (CORE-UA &amp; MAP-UA) and Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA) can only count as introductory courses.    LSP Courses       If the major was declared BEFORE SEPTEMBER 2010, students may use three LSP courses towards their history major, Social Foundations I &amp; II and a Non-West Civilization course. These three courses will always be counted as introductory courses. The remaining 6 history classes must be advanced (HIST-UA 100 or above).    If the major was declared September 2010 or later, only two LSP may be counted toward the major: Social Foundations I and II. Students must take 6 advanced courses so only one more introductory course (below HIST-UA 100) course may be counted toward the major.    LSP students who entered CAS beginning Spring 2009 have their LSP courses averaged - indexed -in to their overall cumulative CAS GPA and into the major GPA if you count an LSP course for the history major. Students who entered CAS prior to Spring 2009 do not have their courses in LSP average in these two CAS averages.    Double Counting of Courses       Up to 2 courses may be double counted between the history major and another major or minor.    Internships (HIST-UA 980/981)       Students who wish to engage in history related work in an agency or institute within or outside New York University (ie. UN agency, an archive, museum or library, philanthropy, a publishing house or an appropriate television program) may apply to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course elective credit. Applications are available from the History office or on the website.    Interns must devote a minimum of 8 hours a week for a 4 points internship.    Internships may not be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirements but are considered as advanced history electives.    Students interested in an internship for credit must write a 250-word proposal on the nature of their internship and describe why it is historically relevant. They must submit this proposal with a letter from their internship supervisor confirming the internship and stating that they will give the student a proposed grade at the end of the semester.    The student should maintain a daily log during the internship and must submit an 8 \u2013 10 page paper at the end of the semester which can be a compilation of these daily logs or a more traditional thematic paper focusing on what was learned during the internship.    Independent Study (HIST-UA 997/998)       Independent Studies may count towards the major if they are classified as HIST-UA and do not exceed a total of 8 points. They may also be used towards satisfying the field distribution requirement upon formal approval from the DUGS. Such courses, however, cannot be counted towards satisfaction of History 101 or the Capstone Seminar.    Students interested in undertaking independent study on a specific or specialized topic of their choice may do so by applying to the DUGS for 2 or 4 points of course credit. Applications are available from the History office or on the website.    The student will indicate a general area of interest and will need to obtain the agreement of a faculty supervisor. The student and faculty supervisor must consult each other on a regular basis, at least biweekly, and the grade for the course must be submitted by the supervisor to the Director of Undergraduate Studies before the last week of the term in which the student is registered.    Graduate Classes (HIST-GA)       Undergraduate seniors with a history GPA of 3.5 or better may take some graduate level history courses. Consult the current course schedule and then seek permission to register from the instructor of the course and the DUGS. In a few cases, a graduate course involving a research paper may be used to fulfill the Capstone Seminar requirement.

The main office is in the King Juan Carlos Center (KJCC) on  floor 4E. The street address is 53 Washington Square South, between Sullivan  and Thompson Street.      Who is the History Department  undergraduate advisor?       Chelsea Rhodes is the advisor to all undergraduate History majors and minors, as well as Global Public Health/History joint majors, and South Asian Studies minors. You may stop by her office (Rm. 416 in the KJCC) at  any time during her walk-in hours: Monday - Thursday 10:00am-12:00pm,  2:00pm-4:00pm. She can also be contacted via email at history.undergrad@nyu.edu or by  phone at (212) 998-8647.       Who is the Director  of Undergraduate Studies (DUGS) for the History Department?      Professor Guy Ortolano is the DUGS. He can be reached via  email at ortolano@nyu.edu , by phone at (212) 998-9657, and in person in KJCC, Rm. 420.           How do I declare a  major or minor in history?      If you are a CAS student, you may declare your major by  visiting your History advisor and filling out a declaration form . You do NOT need to take HIST-UA 101 to  declare the major or minor.     If your primary school at NYU is not CAS, you will need to  meet with your major advisor in your home school and fill out a History declaration  form there.       How do I get cleared  for registration?      History majors will need to fill out a Major Planning Form and meet with the History advisor in the department during the pre-registration advising period. Dates  will be emailed to majors as scheduled along with  full details about the registration process.   Clearance on ALBERT can take up to 2 business days to complete, so  please plan accordingly.      Students enrolled in order departments are still encouraged  to stop by History registration clearance in order to go over their requirements. Students who are abroad may email their  registration worksheets to their advisor at history.undergrad@nyu.edu.           What if my degree  progress report does not accurately reflect my completed requirements?      No need to worry,  ALBERT sometimes organizes History courses incorrectly. If your report is not accurate, please  contact your History advisor at history.undergrad@nyu.edu   or 212-998-8647 to correct this.           COURSE INFORMATION      Do I have to take introductory  classes? How can I tell if a course is considered Introductory or Advanced, and  what is the difference?      You do NOT have to take any introductory courses. You are only permitted to take up to 3  introductory courses to count toward the major, and 1 introductory course to  count towards the minor.      In the history department, advanced courses have course  numbers of HIST-UA 100 and above. Introductory courses are course numbers  between HIST-UA 1 \u2013 99.      Introductory courses cover broad perspectives of issues or  time periods, while advanced courses deal with more specific themes in greater  depth.       If a pass/fail a  course, can it count towards my major or minor?      No pass/fail courses may be counted toward the history  major or minor.          Can a cross-listed  course count towards my history major or minor?      Yes, you should register under the HIST-UA course number in order for it to show up automatically under your major/minor.   You may contact your History advisor with questions.      History majors may double count up to two cross-listed courses  to count toward the History major; but be sure to check the policy of your other major/minor departments.            What is History 101  (HIST-UA 101)?      HIST-UA 101: HISTORICAL INTERPRETATION introduces students to the   discipline of history, preparing them to succeed in the more advanced   courses that constitute the majority of the History major at NYU. The   thematic focus of History 101 varies each semester, drawn from a menu of   themes such as Revolutions, Capitalism, Slavery, Warfare , and Empire .   Through a combination of faculty lectures and graduate student   workshops related to that semester\u2019s theme, students in History 101   learn to pose historical questions, work with primary sources, and   analyze and construct historical arguments; they also become familiar   with the faculty and offerings of the History Department, while further   developing their writing and analytical abilities. You must have taken HIST-UA 101 in order to take a Capstone Seminar. HIST-UA 101 counts as an advanced course towards the major. All History majors MUST take History 101; minors are NOT required to take it.           What is a Capstone  Seminar? When should I take it?      Capstone Seminars (HIST-UA course numbers in the 400 range) represent   the culmination of the History major, in which students design,   research, and write a substantial paper of 20-25 pages, based when   possible upon primary sources. While this course may be taken anytime   after students have completed History 101, most students complete their   Capstone during their junior or senior year. The faculty awards a $250   prize to the author of the best Capstone paper each year.           Are there  pre-requisites for any history courses?      The only History courses with prerequisites are Capstone Seminars; these courses require that you have taken HIST-UA 101 before registering.       Can I petition  courses that I took outside of NYU or in another NYU department to count  toward my major/minor?      Since the History Department offers and sponsors more than 100 courses per  year, in addition to mounting courses at every NYU Global site, students are expected  to complete their requirements through courses sponsored by the department. In rare cases, however, students can petition  to receive credit towards their major/minor for courses based outside of the department. The two most common such cases are (1)  students transferring to NYU from other universities, (2) students who have  identified courses in other departments that do not overlap with our  department\u2019s offerings \u2013 for example, ancient Egyptian history. In these cases, majors may petition up to 2  courses, and minors may petition 1 course, to count toward their History requirements.   In order to petition a course, you must complete a Course  Petition Form , attach the course syllabus, and return the completed form to  the History advisor (Rm 416, KJCC) or email it to history.undergrad@nyu.edu .      *Please note: Course Petitions through the History  department only assess whether a course may be counted towards the history  major or minor. It does not guarantee acceptance of credits at NYU. If you are  petitioning a course taken outside of NYU, you must first go to CAS Advising  (Silver Center, 9th fl.) to petition for the credits to be accepted by the university. Once the non-NYU course appears on your transcript, you can petition for it to count toward your history degree.       Can I count a class I  took abroad on a NYU program towards my major?      Yes. If the class was offered under a history (HIST-UA)  course number or if it was cross-listed with history, it will automatically count towards your  major. All classes  taken abroad are considered advanced level classes. If History courses taken  aboard do NOT have HIST-UA course numbers, than you may petition up to 2  outside courses to count toward the major.      Do any of my LSP  classes count towards my major?      If the major was declared September 2010 or later, only two LSP courses   may be counted toward the major: Social Foundations I and II. Students   must take 6 advanced courses so only one more introductory course (below   HIST-UA 100) course may be counted toward the major. To read in detail about transitioning from LSP, please click here . o Social Foundations I fulfills the Pre-1800 requirement. o Social Foundations II fulfills the Introductory European requirement.      Can I count AP credit  towards my major or minor?      The History department accepts up to 4 credits of AP history  (1 AP course) to count towards an introductory course for the major, provided  that CAS has accepted the credit. No AP credit will be accepted towards the history minor.      Can I count MAP/CORE  courses, Freshman Honors Seminars, and Collegiate Seminars toward my major?      MAP/CORE classes (MAP-UA or CORE-UA), Freshman Honors Seminars (FRSEM-UA), and Advanced/Collegiate  Honors Seminar (AHSEM-UA) can count  toward the major/minor ONLY IF the courses are taught by History faculty members . You would NOT need to petition the  courses to count toward the major.      Advanced/Collegiate Honors Seminars (AHSEM-UA) are considered  advanced level courses. MAP/CORE classes (MAP-UA or CORE-UA), and Freshman Honors Seminars  (FRSEM-UA) are  considered introductory.      Can I count an  Independent Study or Internship toward my major or minor?      Independents studies allow students to dive into a specific topic  of study with a History faculty advisor, while history-related internships (e.g.  UN agency, an archive, museum, library, philanthropy, a publishing house, or an  appropriate television program) give  students insight into how history can be used in the professional world. No Internship or Independent Study will be accepted towards the history minor. History majors interested in receiving either 2 or 4 credits for an independent study or  internship should fill out an application   and return it to the History advisor.
