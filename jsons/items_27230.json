This course will serve as an introduction to the diverse perspectives that are taught in the NYU Postdoctoral Program by exposing students to the key ideas and concepts, the historical development, and the clinical approach of each of the major orientations or schools. Ethical considerations relevant to psychoanalytic practice will be emphasized. ( Ethics   component of the course )    Writing Psychoanalytically (PDPSA.4553)  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch    This course is designed to be taken concomitant with any other course in the Postdoctoral Program or as an independent study project. It serves as an opportunity to write about a particular topic or question either emerging within another course taken at the same time as this course, or as an independent writing project. It is unique to the program as it offers six classes in which candidates are able to compare and contrast their writing over time and with each other.    Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.             The Evolution of Freud\u2019s Thought I, 1895-1915   Instructor: Elliot Kronish      The Evolution of Freud\u2019s Thought II, 1915-1937  Instructor: Elliot Kronish  The Evolution of Interpersonal Psychoanalysis: From Ferenczi, Sullivan and Fromm to Contemporary Psychoanalysis   Instructors: Ann D'Ercole &amp; Barbara Suter   Psychoanalytic History and Changes in Technique: The Place of Interpretation in the Therapeutic Process   Instructor:       The Contemporary Kleinians of London  Instructor: Naama Kushnir Barash    Melanie Klein and Wilfred Bion  Instructor: Michael Eigen          Sandor Ferenczi and Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jay Frankel    British Object Relations Theory: Fairbairn and Guntrip  Instructor:  Neil Skolnick      Winnicott: The Evolution and Impact of His Work   Instructor: Joyce Slochower    Jungian Ways of Working with Images: Interpretative and Experiential Techniques    Instructor: Michael Vannoy Adams  Hans Loewald and the Emergence of Contemporary Freudian Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Seymour Moscovitz     Introduction to the Work of Jacques Lacan  Instructor: Jeanne Wolff-Bernstein  Individuating the Psychoanalytic Experience: Benjamin Wolstein's Contribution to Theory &amp; Practice  Instructor: Tom Jordan Desire's Voice: Agency, Truth, and Free Association  Instructor: Jill Gentile  The Relational Turn in Psychoanalysis: The Work &amp; Legacy of Stephen A. Mitchell  Instructors: Lewis Aron, Anthony Bass, Ken Corbett, Jody Messler Davies, Adrienne Harris       CLINICAL CASE SEMINARS \u2014 THE PSYCHOANALYTIC RELATIONSHIP: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4581)       Case seminars and careful, detailed monitoring of psychoanalytic process over time are among the hallmarks of clinical psychoanalytic education. This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.    Clinical Seminar in Psychoanalytic Process  Instructor: Philip Bromberg    Clinical Case Seminar--Doing the Work: The Experience of Analyst and Patient  Instructor: Barbra Locker         Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Jessica Benjamin     The Analytic Relationship: Case Seminar and Clinical Theory  Instructor: Anthony Bass    The Therapeutic Object Relationship  Instructor: Mark Grunes                Countertransference: A Clinical Seminar  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch  Working at the \"Intimate Edge\"  Instructor: Darlene Ehrenberg  Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Continuous Case Seminar: Problems in Early Integration and the Holding Environment  Instructor: Aaron Thaler  Clinical Case Seminar: How Different Theoretical Approaches Inform the Analyst's Direct Clinical Experience with Patients  Instructor: Warren Wilner The Art of Psychoanalysis: A Clinical Case Seminar on Working (and Playing) with the Unconscious  Instructor: Danielle Knafo Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Muriel Dimen    CLINICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4582)         The psychotherapist and psychoanalyst must learn to tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual patient. One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.          Narcissistic States and the Therapeutic Process  Instructor: Sheldon Bach    Treatment of Depressive Conditions  Instructor: Martin Nass       Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse  Instructor: Judith Alpert    Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy with the Person with Psychotic Processes  Instructor: Brian Koehler    Neurotic Personality Organization  Instructor: TBA    Treatment of the Difficult Patient  Instructor: Richard Lasky    Treatment of Borderline and Narcissistic Disorders  Instructor: Isaac Tylim    Selected Issues in Trauma Studies  Instructors: Judith Alpert , Robert Prince , Nina Thomas , &amp; Isaac Tylim    Repetitive Painful States  Instructor: Elliot Kronish    Shame and Narcissism: Developmental Issues and Clinical Approaches  Instructor: Mary Libbey     Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Addictive Disorders: Integrating Contemporary Theory and Traditional Treatment Approaches  Instructor: Debra Rothschild    Adult Onset Trauma  Instructor: Ghislaine Boulanger  An Object Relations Theory Approach to Technical Challenges  Instructor: Monica Carsky  When the Body Has a Mind of Its Own: An Interpersonal Approach to Eating Disorders  Instructor: Jean Petrucelli  Ghosts in the Consulting Room: A Seminar on Repetitive (Re)Enactments  Instructor: Margery Kalb  Clinical &amp; Theoretical Issues in the Treatment of Pathological Dissociation &amp; DID   Instructors: Elizabeth Howell &amp; Sheldon Itzkowitz  Treating Forms of Catastrophic Anxiety in Analytic Work  Instructor: Marvin Hurvich  Narcissism in the Interactive Matrix: Contemporary Perspectives on Technique  Instructor: Sarah Schoen   THE STUDY &amp; CLINICAL USE OF DREAMS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4583)        The origins of psychoanalysis go back to Freud\u2019s study of his own and his patients\u2019 dreams and to his first major work, The Interpretation of Dreams . This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.       Comparative Analysis of Major Contemporary Orientations  Instructor: Warren Wilner    Comparative theories of Therapeutic Action  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch    On Termination: Theoretical, Technical and Relational Considerations  Instructor: Jill Salberg  Inter-Orientation Case Seminar  Instructor: Barbara Dusansky  A Clinical Approach to Transforming Enactment  Instructor: Michael Varga   Comparing Models of Intersubjectivity from Different Theoretical Perspectives  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch  Relational Practice: An Integrative Psychoanalytic Perspective   Instructor: Paul Wachtel   Theoretical Pluralism and the Working Clinician  Instructor: Fred Pine   Comparative Models in Psychoanalytic Theory  Instructor: Steven Ellman    Our Bodies, Our Patients' Bodies, the Dance  Instructors: Katie Gentile , Steven Knoblauch , &amp; Sue Shapiro  Transformations of Agency: Theory and Clinical Phenomenology  Instructor: Jill Gentile  Clinical Implications of the Cognitive Neuroscience Revolution  Instructor: Michael Moskowitz  Psychotherapy Integration: CBT &amp; Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jill Bresler  Mourning as Transformation: the Creative Edge of Traumatic &amp; \"Ordinary Loss\"  Instructor: Donna Bassin       PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY &amp; TECHNIQUE: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4585)      This course focuses on the intricate and complex relationship between theory and clinical technique. How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.            Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique I  Instructor: Andrew Druck   Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique II  Instructor: Andrew Druck  Relational Concepts: An Integrative Seminar  Instructor: Jody Davies  Fundamentals of the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Lisa Director  Introduction to Relational Models of Psychoanalysis and Their Implications for Treatment  Instructor: Jeremy Safran  Relational Self Psychology: Essential Contributions  Instructor: Carolyn Clement  Relational Self Psychology: Contemporary Trends in Relational Self Psychology: Theories &amp; Clinical Applications  Instructor: James Fosshage  The Analysis of Conflict in Contemporary Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Stanley Grand  Interaction in Psychoanalysis: Transference, Countertransference, and Enactment  Instructor: Gil Katz   Psyche-Soma and Soma-Psyche: The Foregrounded Body in Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Sharone Bergner  Hate, Envy, and Destructiveness  Instructor: Sue Grand   Constructivism and the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Donnel Stern   Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity in Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Bruce Reis  Dialectical Constructivism I  Instructor: Irwin Z.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.                Psychoanalysis and Politics  Instructor: Steven Botticelli  More Than Personal: Political and Spiritual Dimensions of the Therapeutic Relationship  Instructor: Andrew Samuels   Race, Racism and Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren  Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: Phenomenological, Spiritual, and Cultural Issues  Instructor: Sara Weber &amp; William Auerbach  Dissociation and Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Foundations of Intersubjectivity: An Introduction to the Philosophy that Grounds Relational Thinking  Instructor: Jack Foehl Psychoanalysis &amp; Religious Narratives: The Christian Narrative  Instructor: Marie Hoffman  Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Studies  Instructors: Steven Botticelli &amp; Katie Gentile  Dissociation &amp; Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Social Identities: Race, Class, Gender &amp; Sexuality  Instructor: Melanie Suchet &amp; Cleonie White  The Politics of Psychoanalysis &amp; the Psychoanalysis of Politics  Instructor: Nancy Hollander        GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4587)       Historically, aspects of psychoanalysis were rooted in 19 th century cultural assumptions about sexuality and gender. Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.                 Autogynephilia, Barebacking, Cisgenderism: Can We Talk (about Gender &amp; Sexuality)?  Instructor: Jack Drescher   Gender and Psychoanalysis: History, Critique, Queering &amp; Complicating (NB: instructor is in the process of updating the readings)  Instructor: Virginia Goldner  Sexuality in Relational Perspective  Instructor: TBA Advanced Seminar on Sexuality in Relational Perspective   Instructor: Muriel Dimen  The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman  Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: Theoretical &amp; Clinical Perspectives  Instructor: Galit Atlas (Koch)       DEVELOPMENTAL &amp; LIFE SPAN ISSUES: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4588)       The genetic and epigenetic (developmental) points of view have long been important to psychoanalysis. Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.               Developmental Perspectives in Psychoanalysis: Infancy through Latency  Instructor: Neal Vorus   Adolescence in Development &amp; Adult Treatment  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren   The Analytic Process &amp; the Process of Development: Emerging Developmental Perspectives &amp; the Actuality of Analytic Work  Instructor: Susan Warshaw Developmental Issues in the Analytic Setting  Instructor: Adrienne Harris Object Loss in Clinical Practice   Instructor: TBA The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality, and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman   Coupling: An Interpersonal Perspective on Adult Development and Intimacy  Instructor: Mary-Joan Gerson   The Developmental Lens and Adult Analytic Work  Instructor: Katherine Oram   Anxiety, Envy, Shame &amp; the Developmental Process  Instructor: Christopher Bonovitz       INFANCY &amp; PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4589)       The past several decades have seen an explosion of research on infancy, and the findings of infancy research have had a significant impact on psychoanalytic theory and practice. Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.

Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.

Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.

Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.

Focuses on fundamental theoretical and methodological issues pertaining to the academic study of religion. Exposes students to, and familiarizes them with, some of the more important theories of the origin, character, and function of religion as a human phenomenon. Students are given an opportunity to encounter and test an assortment of the main scholarly approaches to understanding and interpreting religious phenomena, including psychological, sociological, anthropological, historical, and hermeneutical perspectives. Advanced Seminar: Comparative Topics in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 15 Prerequisites: junior or senior status, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1), and at least two other religious studies courses, or permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. What Is Islam? RELST-UA 85 Identical to MEIS-UA 691, HIST-UA 85. Offered yearly. 4 points. An introductory course dealing with the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam; the beliefs and practices of the Islamic community; differences between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite Islam; Sufism; the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life of the Islamic commonwealth; and modern Islamic revival. Gender, Sexuality, and the Body in Early Christianity RELST-UA 86 Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students reexamine the light shed by ancient writings (and other evidence) not only on the role(s) of women in ancient Christian groups but also on the ideologies of gender promoted or assumed by those groups. The focus, while predominantly on women, also extends to the way in which gender identities were constructed and adhered to by males and females. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam RELST-UA 102 Identical to MEDI-UA 25, MEIS-UA 800, HBRJD-UA 160. Offered yearly. 4 points. This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions. Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism RELST-UA 104 Identical to HBRJD-UA 430, MEDI-UA 430. Wolfson. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin.

Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion. Religions of India RELST-UA 337 Offered yearly. 4 points. Introduces students to the vibrant religious traditions of South Asia. Examines Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Jain, and Sikh traditions, as well as the ancient and modern contexts in which they are situated. Students focus on the ways that various problems (material, intellectual, political) have served as catalysts for the formation and dissolution of communities of interpretation and practice and reexamine the multiple pasts of South Asia without projecting modern categories onto those traditions. Belief and Social Life in China RELST-UA 351 Identical to ANTH-UA 351, EAST-UA 351. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points . The Chinese word for religion means \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cTeaching\u201d immediately implies at least two people, and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Identical to CLASS-UA 404. Meineche. 4 points. See description under Classics in this Bulletin. Jewish Responses to Modernity: Religion and Nationalism RELST-UA 470 Identical to HBRJD-UA 719. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin. Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects? The History of Religions of Africa RELST-UA 566 Identical to HIST-UA 566, SCA-UA 0790. Hull. 4 points. See description under History in this Bulletin.

Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. Topics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included Christianity and culture, American evangelicalism, religion and violence, and postcolonialism. Martyrdom, Ancient and Modern RELST-UA 660 Identical to CLASS-UA 646. Offered every other year. Becker. 4 points. Examines the theory and practice of martyrdom in the West. Begins with a close study of the development of the martyrological discourse in classical, early Christian, early Jewish, and Muslim literature and culture. Also traces how the concept of martyrdom is deployed in modern culture in various phenomena, such as the \u201cColumbine martyrs,\u201d \u201cmartyrdom operations\u201d (\u201csuicide bombers\u201d), political martyrdom, and modern notions of holy war.

American Evangelicalism RELST-UA 820 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Christian evangelicals makes up over a quarter of the American population\u2014by some estimates number up to 100 million people\u2014and have held central leadership positions in government, business, and entertainment. But where did they come from, and what do they believe? This course traces the history of modern evangelicalism from its roots in the transatlantic awakenings of the 18th century through to the present. Along the way, we cover colonial America and religion in the new nation, evangelical reform in the nineteenth century, the clash between fundamentalists and modernists, holiness and Pentecostal movements, African American evangelicalism and the civil rights movement, the Christian right, youth movements, and neo-evangelicalism. We address variations in theology and religious practice with particular attention to how evangelicals have negotiated, revised, or defined central tenets of modern Western culture, including contemporary understandings of gender, race and ethnicity, performance, nation, sexuality, and economies. Anthropology of Religion RELST-UA 829 Identical to ANTH-UA 30. 4 points. See description under Anthropology in this Bulletin. Introduction to Buddhism RELST-UA 832 Identical to EAST-UA 832.

Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States. Tibetan Buddhism RELST-UA 835 Identical to EAST-UA 835. Offered periodically. 4 points. An introduction to Tibetan Buddhism doctrine and practice. Approaches the subject from historical and thematic perspectives, beginning with a close study of one of the classic Tibetan guides to Tibetan Buddhism for a solid foundation in the principles of the tradition. Proceeds along a historical track, beginning with the seventh-century arrival of Buddhism in Tibet to the present-day encounter with Western devotees of exiled Tibetan lamas. Topics include doctrinal innovation, ritual, myth, art, sacred geography, revelation, and the role of Buddhism in Tibet\u2019s relationship with its neighbors. Readings consist of primary texts in translation and secondary literature on the study of religion and Tibetan Buddhism. The Sufis: Mystics of Islam RELST-UA 863 Identical to MEIS-UA 863.

Independent Study RELST-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the instructor. 1 to 4 points per term. Cultures and Contexts: Islamic Societies MAP-UA 502 Offered every year. 4 points. This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}, {"content": "Featured Courses - Art and Art Professions - NYU Steinhardt                                                         Skip to content         NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development           apply now     request info     contact                                      Department of Art and Art Professions            NYU Art Facebook    NYU Art Twitter            Art and Art Professions                 MFA     MA          Art Education      Art Therapy      Costume Studies      Visual Arts Administration             Undergraduate          BFA Studio Art      Minors             About          Exhibitions      Events        Facilities      Faculty      Staff      Student Resources      Internships      Summer                                           Featured Courses       Go to the NYU Registration site for a complete listing of courses, course numbers, and call numbers.

Art: Practice and Ideas examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create &amp; reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting &amp; sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, &amp; computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, &amp; postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, &amp; technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical &amp; social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time. ARTCR-UE 0050 Modern Art and Contemporary Culture Examines the impact of modernism in both its historic &amp; contemporary relationships to culture &amp; society, through the study of painting, sculpture, architecture, &amp; the media arts from the late 1800&rsquo;s to the late 1950s.

Works of art are considered from slides, films, and reproductions. ART-UE 1914 Interdisciplinary Projects: Representation and Identity Open only to art majors or by permission. Prerequisite: three semesters of painting. Consideration of particular techniques allows students to broaden the range of their skills and expression. This is a studio class. Each week begins with a 20-minute discussion of current gallery or museum exhibitions that we have seen. Critiques will be every 3rd week. Students will be expected to work on their own ideas or projects. I will work with each student based on where they are in that process. Technical advice will be individual as well. Students are encourage to fully investigate their materials during this class. If there is a need for specific assignments this will be done on an individual basis. Students are encouraged to keep drawing journals and start a file of resource material with their paintings in mind. ART-UE 1391 Advanced Projects in Digital Art: \"Mind Remapping\" In this course, students will develop projects that use, critique and expand the notion and boundaries of digital media. The exploration of the mind's own processing of information will be a conceptual foundation for the course as we examine the ways in which digital tools mimic, respond to and amplify human desire. Media in the class will range from images and animation to video and music. The class will be an opportunity to both learn new tools and deepen skills already begun. Projects will be presented and discussed. ART-UE 1393 Advanced Projects in Art &amp; Media: &ldquo;Performance and Photo/Video&rdquo; This class will utilize each student&rsquo;s body in situ or in photography or video to demonstrate issues that transcend the particular aura of the individual and spread ideas into and from culture.

Psychoanalytic Supervision (PDPSA.4543)  Instructor: Helen Gediman        This course reviews the present state of psychoanalytic thinking on the supervisory process with major emphases on the supervisory process in a climate of theoretical diversity and heterogeneity and the supervisory process as a triadic system with multiple interactions as the focus. Readings and clinical presentations by students are utilized to illustrate the main issues being studied.            THE HISTORY &amp; DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOANALYSIS FOCUSING ON SPECIFIC CONTRIBUTORS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4580)    As in the humanities, and unlike some sciences, psychoanalysis must be studied historically. Whatever one\u2019s current point of view, a well-educated analyst must have a solid understanding of Freud\u2019s contributions and texts as well as those of other significant contributors. Often the contributions of seminal psychoanalytic writers must also be studied in conjunction with their school of thought. This course teaches students the theory and practice of psychoanalysis through a study of notable individuals\u2019 contributions, developmentally and historically, as well as by studying the historical development of specific schools of thought. In various semesters or in different sections this course will focus on one contributor or tradition.

Mitchell  Instructors: Lewis Aron, Anthony Bass, Ken Corbett, Jody Messler Davies, Adrienne Harris       CLINICAL CASE SEMINARS \u2014 THE PSYCHOANALYTIC RELATIONSHIP: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4581)       Case seminars and careful, detailed monitoring of psychoanalytic process over time are among the hallmarks of clinical psychoanalytic education. This course encourages students to present their own clinical work in detail over time working with feedback from other students and with the guidance of faculty. Depending on the semester or section the focus may be on treatment from a particular theoretical slant or on specific aspects of the treatment.    Clinical Seminar in Psychoanalytic Process  Instructor: Philip Bromberg    Clinical Case Seminar--Doing the Work: The Experience of Analyst and Patient  Instructor: Barbra Locker         Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Jessica Benjamin     The Analytic Relationship: Case Seminar and Clinical Theory  Instructor: Anthony Bass    The Therapeutic Object Relationship  Instructor: Mark Grunes                Countertransference: A Clinical Seminar  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch  Working at the \"Intimate Edge\"  Instructor: Darlene Ehrenberg  Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Continuous Case Seminar: Problems in Early Integration and the Holding Environment  Instructor: Aaron Thaler  Clinical Case Seminar: How Different Theoretical Approaches Inform the Analyst's Direct Clinical Experience with Patients  Instructor: Warren Wilner The Art of Psychoanalysis: A Clinical Case Seminar on Working (and Playing) with the Unconscious  Instructor: Danielle Knafo Countertransference in Working with Trauma  Instructor: Nina Thomas  Clinical Case Seminar  Instructor: Muriel Dimen    CLINICAL TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISORDERS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4582)         The psychotherapist and psychoanalyst must learn to tailor the treatment to the needs of the individual patient. One factor in individualizing treatment is to take into account diagnostic considerations and various dimensions of psychopathology. This course introduces students to current, sophisticated thinking about how psychoanalysis works with various styles of personality and forms of pathology. Each semester or section will focus on a different category or personality style taught from one or more theoretical perspectives.          Narcissistic States and the Therapeutic Process  Instructor: Sheldon Bach    Treatment of Depressive Conditions  Instructor: Martin Nass       Adult Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse  Instructor: Judith Alpert    Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy with the Person with Psychotic Processes  Instructor: Brian Koehler    Neurotic Personality Organization  Instructor: TBA    Treatment of the Difficult Patient  Instructor: Richard Lasky    Treatment of Borderline and Narcissistic Disorders  Instructor: Isaac Tylim    Selected Issues in Trauma Studies  Instructors: Judith Alpert , Robert Prince , Nina Thomas , &amp; Isaac Tylim    Repetitive Painful States  Instructor: Elliot Kronish    Shame and Narcissism: Developmental Issues and Clinical Approaches  Instructor: Mary Libbey     Psychoanalytic Perspectives on Addictive Disorders: Integrating Contemporary Theory and Traditional Treatment Approaches  Instructor: Debra Rothschild    Adult Onset Trauma  Instructor: Ghislaine Boulanger  An Object Relations Theory Approach to Technical Challenges  Instructor: Monica Carsky  When the Body Has a Mind of Its Own: An Interpersonal Approach to Eating Disorders  Instructor: Jean Petrucelli  Ghosts in the Consulting Room: A Seminar on Repetitive (Re)Enactments  Instructor: Margery Kalb  Clinical &amp; Theoretical Issues in the Treatment of Pathological Dissociation &amp; DID   Instructors: Elizabeth Howell &amp; Sheldon Itzkowitz  Treating Forms of Catastrophic Anxiety in Analytic Work  Instructor: Marvin Hurvich  Narcissism in the Interactive Matrix: Contemporary Perspectives on Technique  Instructor: Sarah Schoen   THE STUDY &amp; CLINICAL USE OF DREAMS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4583)        The origins of psychoanalysis go back to Freud\u2019s study of his own and his patients\u2019 dreams and to his first major work, The Interpretation of Dreams . This course introduces students to current theories of dreaming, empirical research on dreaming, and clinical work with dreams. Each semester or section will focus on a specific aspect of dreams, such as methodology for dream interpretation or comparative study of dream theories.           Clinical Seminar on Dreams  Instructor: Mark Blechner    Current Perspectives on Dreaming: Theory, Research and Practice  Instructor: James Fosshage   COMPARATIVE PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4584)    Contemporary psychoanalysis is diverse and pluralistic, some might even say fragmented into various schools and theories. This course examines psychoanalytic theories and clinical practices using a model of \u201ccomparative psychoanalysis.\u201d Theories and practices are examined historically, compared along the lines of theoretical and clinical issues, and compared for their implications in the treatment situation. Readings and course discussions add complexity and depth to the student\u2019s sense of the contributions and limitations of each model for clinical practice.       Comparative Analysis of Major Contemporary Orientations  Instructor: Warren Wilner    Comparative theories of Therapeutic Action  Instructor: Irwin Hirsch    On Termination: Theoretical, Technical and Relational Considerations  Instructor: Jill Salberg  Inter-Orientation Case Seminar  Instructor: Barbara Dusansky  A Clinical Approach to Transforming Enactment  Instructor: Michael Varga   Comparing Models of Intersubjectivity from Different Theoretical Perspectives  Instructor: Steven Knoblauch  Relational Practice: An Integrative Psychoanalytic Perspective   Instructor: Paul Wachtel   Theoretical Pluralism and the Working Clinician  Instructor: Fred Pine   Comparative Models in Psychoanalytic Theory  Instructor: Steven Ellman    Our Bodies, Our Patients' Bodies, the Dance  Instructors: Katie Gentile , Steven Knoblauch , &amp; Sue Shapiro  Transformations of Agency: Theory and Clinical Phenomenology  Instructor: Jill Gentile  Clinical Implications of the Cognitive Neuroscience Revolution  Instructor: Michael Moskowitz  Psychotherapy Integration: CBT &amp; Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Jill Bresler  Mourning as Transformation: the Creative Edge of Traumatic &amp; \"Ordinary Loss\"  Instructor: Donna Bassin       PSYCHOANALYTIC THEORY &amp; TECHNIQUE: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4585)      This course focuses on the intricate and complex relationship between theory and clinical technique. How do we understand the psychoanalytic method? What are the technical implications of diverse theories? What is the relationship between theory and technique and when can theory aid or interfere in treatment? Each semester or section will examine a specific theory and its application in depth and detail.            Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique I  Instructor: Andrew Druck   Theory of Psychoanalytic Technique II  Instructor: Andrew Druck  Relational Concepts: An Integrative Seminar  Instructor: Jody Davies  Fundamentals of the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Lisa Director  Introduction to Relational Models of Psychoanalysis and Their Implications for Treatment  Instructor: Jeremy Safran  Relational Self Psychology: Essential Contributions  Instructor: Carolyn Clement  Relational Self Psychology: Contemporary Trends in Relational Self Psychology: Theories &amp; Clinical Applications  Instructor: James Fosshage  The Analysis of Conflict in Contemporary Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Stanley Grand  Interaction in Psychoanalysis: Transference, Countertransference, and Enactment  Instructor: Gil Katz   Psyche-Soma and Soma-Psyche: The Foregrounded Body in Psychoanalytic Theory and Practice  Instructor: Sharone Bergner  Hate, Envy, and Destructiveness  Instructor: Sue Grand   Constructivism and the Psychoanalytic Situation  Instructor: Donnel Stern   Subjectivity and Intersubjectivity in Relational Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Bruce Reis  Dialectical Constructivism I  Instructor: Irwin Z.

From this point of view, psychoanalysis itself can be critiqued as constructing and constraining such discourses. In addition, psychoanalysis is viewed as part of the larger mental health system, with all its social welfare and social control functions. But psychoanalysis can also function in service of social critique, as when it offers understandings of socio-economic-political structures that are concealed in the surface of ordinary discourses. These include the workings of power and privilege and how these are distributed along lines of race, social class, culture, gender, and sexual orientation. Each semester or section of this course will focus on various political, spiritual, and cultural issues.                Psychoanalysis and Politics  Instructor: Steven Botticelli  More Than Personal: Political and Spiritual Dimensions of the Therapeutic Relationship  Instructor: Andrew Samuels   Race, Racism and Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren  Psychoanalysis and Buddhism: Phenomenological, Spiritual, and Cultural Issues  Instructor: Sara Weber &amp; William Auerbach  Dissociation and Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Foundations of Intersubjectivity: An Introduction to the Philosophy that Grounds Relational Thinking  Instructor: Jack Foehl Psychoanalysis &amp; Religious Narratives: The Christian Narrative  Instructor: Marie Hoffman  Psychoanalysis &amp; Cultural Studies  Instructors: Steven Botticelli &amp; Katie Gentile  Dissociation &amp; Cultural Forms  Instructor: Elizabeth Hegeman  Social Identities: Race, Class, Gender &amp; Sexuality  Instructor: Melanie Suchet &amp; Cleonie White  The Politics of Psychoanalysis &amp; the Psychoanalysis of Politics  Instructor: Nancy Hollander        GENDER &amp; SEXUALITY: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4587)       Historically, aspects of psychoanalysis were rooted in 19 th century cultural assumptions about sexuality and gender. Feminist critiques of those assumptions, both within the field and from psychoanalytic outsiders, have led to dramatic changes in psychoanalytic theory and practice. This course links the psychic and the social in the construction of gender and sexuality. Each semester or section will examine one aspect of this constellation in depth, focusing variously on gender, sexuality, feminism, and/or queer theory.                 Autogynephilia, Barebacking, Cisgenderism: Can We Talk (about Gender &amp; Sexuality)?  Instructor: Jack Drescher   Gender and Psychoanalysis: History, Critique, Queering &amp; Complicating (NB: instructor is in the process of updating the readings)  Instructor: Virginia Goldner  Sexuality in Relational Perspective  Instructor: TBA Advanced Seminar on Sexuality in Relational Perspective   Instructor: Muriel Dimen  The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman  Comparative Perspectives on Sexuality: Theoretical &amp; Clinical Perspectives  Instructor: Galit Atlas (Koch)       DEVELOPMENTAL &amp; LIFE SPAN ISSUES: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4588)       The genetic and epigenetic (developmental) points of view have long been important to psychoanalysis. Classical theory began with a focus on the development of sexuality and the psychosexual stages, but soon analysts were studying the development of the sense of reality and a variety of developmental lines. This course examines various developmental perspectives in psychoanalysis, sometimes by observing young children and at other times retrospectively through the reconstruction of earlier life experience in adults. Some semesters and sections focus on infant research, some on later developmental phases, some on the clinical implications of developmental theory, and some on very specific developmental factors such as early loss or the family context.               Developmental Perspectives in Psychoanalysis: Infancy through Latency  Instructor: Neal Vorus   Adolescence in Development &amp; Adult Treatment  Instructor: Marsha Levy-Warren   The Analytic Process &amp; the Process of Development: Emerging Developmental Perspectives &amp; the Actuality of Analytic Work  Instructor: Susan Warshaw Developmental Issues in the Analytic Setting  Instructor: Adrienne Harris Object Loss in Clinical Practice   Instructor: TBA The Power of Envy in Gender Development, Sexuality, and Everyday Life  Instructor: Carolyn Ellman   Coupling: An Interpersonal Perspective on Adult Development and Intimacy  Instructor: Mary-Joan Gerson   The Developmental Lens and Adult Analytic Work  Instructor: Katherine Oram   Anxiety, Envy, Shame &amp; the Developmental Process  Instructor: Christopher Bonovitz       INFANCY &amp; PSYCHOANALYSIS: Selected Topics (PDPSA.4589)       The past several decades have seen an explosion of research on infancy, and the findings of infancy research have had a significant impact on psychoanalytic theory and practice. Psychoanalytic theory has itself influenced infancy research and infancy research has influenced psychoanalysis. Second-by-second analysis of face-to-face interactions between parent and infant have led to monumental changes in how we understand bodily and affect regulation as well as the early origins of relatedness and patterns of communication that continue to operate through the lifetime. Each semester or section of this course will explore recent developments in infancy research focusing on methodological considerations, theoretical and/or clinical implications.           Infant Research and Adult Treatment  Instructor: Beatrice Beebe   Treating the \"Difficult-to-Treat\" Patient: Principles Derived from Infant Research  Instructor:  Frank Lachmann Babies in the Bathwater: Images of the Infant in Psychoanalysis  Instructor: Stephen Seligman                                               Sitemap       |      Contact Us       |              &copy; New York University       |       Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Course Offerings    | Religious Studies | NYU                                                                                                                                                        Back to Previous Page         Course Offerings     Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 1 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Focuses on fundamental theoretical and methodological issues pertaining to the academic study of religion. Exposes students to, and familiarizes them with, some of the more important theories of the origin, character, and function of religion as a human phenomenon. Students are given an opportunity to encounter and test an assortment of the main scholarly approaches to understanding and interpreting religious phenomena, including psychological, sociological, anthropological, historical, and hermeneutical perspectives. Advanced Seminar: Comparative Topics in the Study of Religion RELST-UA 15 Prerequisites: junior or senior status, Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1), and at least two other religious studies courses, or permission of the instructor. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Complements and develops the methodological and theoretical emphasis encountered in Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion, albeit with a higher level of specificity and sophistication. The focus is on a specific thematic motif with cross-cultural applicability (for example, ritual, the body, sacrifice, religion and the state). Students can explore the import of the motif in question for their own area of specialization, as well as examine its manifestations in other traditions. Students are expected to make formal presentations to the class. What Is Islam? RELST-UA 85 Identical to MEIS-UA 691, HIST-UA 85. Offered yearly. 4 points. An introductory course dealing with the life of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of Islam; the beliefs and practices of the Islamic community; differences between Sunni and Shi\u2019ite Islam; Sufism; the spiritual, intellectual, and artistic life of the Islamic commonwealth; and modern Islamic revival. Gender, Sexuality, and the Body in Early Christianity RELST-UA 86 Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students reexamine the light shed by ancient writings (and other evidence) not only on the role(s) of women in ancient Christian groups but also on the ideologies of gender promoted or assumed by those groups. The focus, while predominantly on women, also extends to the way in which gender identities were constructed and adhered to by males and females. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam RELST-UA 102 Identical to MEDI-UA 25, MEIS-UA 800, HBRJD-UA 160. Offered yearly. 4 points. This course seeks to uncover the differences and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as religious traditions, and to assess their roles and interactions in the formation and functions of human societies. We will examine the ancient origins and contemporary relevance of these monotheistic traditions through the methodological and theoretical frameworks of the academic discipline of religious studies to gain an understanding of their connections to culture, society, and politics. We will root our study in consideration of ancient and medieval sources of each religion, while simultaneously reflecting upon the significance of their development for modern societies. We will emphasize the immense variety of expression found among Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Indeed, our study will uncover the existence of Judaisms, Christianities, and Islams, rather than a trio of theological monoliths. Such variation will be placed in tension with the strong similarities\u2014family resemblances\u2014shared among these religions. Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism RELST-UA 104 Identical to HBRJD-UA 430, MEDI-UA 430. Wolfson. 4 points. See description under Hebrew and Judaic Studies in this Bulletin.

Introduces students to issues and themes in the history of the Jesus movement and early Christianity through a survey of the main texts of the canonical New Testament, as well as other important early Christian documents. Students are given the opportunity to read most of the New Testament text in a lecture hall setting where the professor provides historical context and focuses on significant issues, describes modern scholarly methodologies, and places the empirical material within the larger framework of ancient history and the theoretical study of religion. Religions of India RELST-UA 337 Offered yearly. 4 points. Introduces students to the vibrant religious traditions of South Asia. Examines Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Jain, and Sikh traditions, as well as the ancient and modern contexts in which they are situated. Students focus on the ways that various problems (material, intellectual, political) have served as catalysts for the formation and dissolution of communities of interpretation and practice and reexamine the multiple pasts of South Asia without projecting modern categories onto those traditions. Belief and Social Life in China RELST-UA 351 Identical to ANTH-UA 351, EAST-UA 351. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points . The Chinese word for religion means \u201cteaching.\u201d \u201cTeaching\u201d immediately implies at least two people, and belief in China has always been theorized and practiced as mediated by the presence of others, miraculous and mundane. The course explores what Chinese people \u201ctaught\u201d themselves about the person, society, and the natural world and thus how social life was constructed and maintained. It examines in historical perspective the classic texts of the Taoist and Confucian canon and their synthesis; and Buddhism and the synthesis of the \u201cThree Teachings.\u201d We will introduce modern religious life in Taiwan and in the People\u2019s Republic. Classical Mythology RELST-UA 404 Identical to CLASS-UA 404. Meineche. 4 points. See description under Classics in this Bulletin.

Confessional Culture from Augustine to Oprah RELST-UA 561 Offered every other year. Pellegrini. 4 points. Traces the different uses and forms \u201cthe confession\u201d has taken in Western culture. How has the confession evolved from a specifically religious practice to become a genre of self-making in a putatively secular modernity? A consistent concern is the way confessional practices have increasingly become linked to sex and sexuality. The range of texts and genres surveyed includes philosophical and religious treatises, political pamphlets, legal history of confession, psychoanalytic case studies, feminist consciousness-raising, coming-out stories, self-help literature, tell-all celebrity autobiographies, TV talk shows, YouTube, and film/video. What can we learn from the differences and similarities between these confessional modes, their cultural locations, their historical moments, and their ideological effects?

Jews and Christians in the Ancient World RELST-UA 611 Identical to CLASS-UA 611, HBRJD-UA 128. Offered periodically. Becker. 4 points. Students acquire a basic knowledge of the early history of Judaism and Christianity. However, on the theoretical level, the course aims to provide students with a forum for asking some of the questions most relevant to religious studies: Are we to use self-definition, typology, or both in our formulating religious categories? How do certain categories help and hinder our understanding of religious and other social phenomena? What is the relationship between ideology and the social world? How do we learn about the \u201creal\u201d world from literary evidence? Religion, State, and Politics RELST-UA 613 Offered periodically. 4 points. Introduces students to the debate on secularism by following a comparative approach. Students first gain basic knowledge related to the emergence and development of the secularization paradigm. In a second step, they confront it with empirical data. Concretely, this course introduces different examples of state-religion relationships and discusses the impact of the respective historical experiences and religio-cultural backgrounds on them. This agenda serves to develop a critical overview on the scope and limits of secularization theory and provides students with basic tools to situate current debates on religion in a broader theoretical frame. Religious Bodies RELST-UA 642 Identical to ANTH-UA 29. No prerequisites. Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Human physicality is something that we share in our \u201cnatures,\" yet constantly elaborate differently in our \u201ccultures.\" This course explores some of the rich and often conflicted relationships between cultures of religious practices and the human body: the body as medium both for ritual and religious experience; the body as locus for virtue and sin; the split between mind and body. We look at the body in various situations\u2014gendered, sexualized, covered, naked, suffering, disabled, altered, missing\u2014and interrogate notions of representations and ideals\u2014from the religious ban on representing the human body to divine anthropomorphism. This course examines a variety of religions and practices. Religion and Media RELST-UA 645 Offered periodically. Zito. 4 points. Introduces the long-standing and complex connection between religious practices and various media. Analyzes how human hearing, vision, and the performing body have been used historically to express and maintain religious life through music, voice, images, words, and rituals. Attention is then devoted to more recent electronic media such as radio, film, television, video, and the Internet. An anthropological/historical perspective on studying religion is pursued. Prior course work in religious studies, anthropology, or media studies would be helpful, but it is not necessary if you are willing to work hard. Religion, Sexuality, and Public Life RELST-UA 646 Offered periodically. Pellegrini. 4 points. This country was founded on the promise of religious freedom, and yet U.S. laws and policies regulating sexual life derive much of their rationale from specifically religious notions of \u201cgood\u201d versus \u201cbad\u201d sex, what bodies are \u201cfor,\u201d and what kinds of human relationships are valuable. How are we to understand this apparent contradiction? If sexual life is a special case, what makes it so? Finally, what are the implications, for both sexual and religious freedom, of treating sexual life as a special case? Course materials are designed to introduce students to critical approaches to the study of religion in society, as well as to familiarize them with important work in the interdisciplinary areas of gender and sexuality studies. Topics in Religious Studies RELST-UA 650 4 points. The emphasis of this course varies each year and is designed to allow flexibility in course offerings from visiting scholars and specialists in particular fields. Past examinations have included Christianity and culture, American evangelicalism, religion and violence, and postcolonialism. Martyrdom, Ancient and Modern RELST-UA 660 Identical to CLASS-UA 646. Offered every other year. Becker. 4 points. Examines the theory and practice of martyrdom in the West. Begins with a close study of the development of the martyrological discourse in classical, early Christian, early Jewish, and Muslim literature and culture. Also traces how the concept of martyrdom is deployed in modern culture in various phenomena, such as the \u201cColumbine martyrs,\u201d \u201cmartyrdom operations\u201d (\u201csuicide bombers\u201d), political martyrdom, and modern notions of holy war.

American Evangelicalism RELST-UA 820 Offered in the fall. 4 points. Christian evangelicals makes up over a quarter of the American population\u2014by some estimates number up to 100 million people\u2014and have held central leadership positions in government, business, and entertainment. But where did they come from, and what do they believe? This course traces the history of modern evangelicalism from its roots in the transatlantic awakenings of the 18th century through to the present. Along the way, we cover colonial America and religion in the new nation, evangelical reform in the nineteenth century, the clash between fundamentalists and modernists, holiness and Pentecostal movements, African American evangelicalism and the civil rights movement, the Christian right, youth movements, and neo-evangelicalism. We address variations in theology and religious practice with particular attention to how evangelicals have negotiated, revised, or defined central tenets of modern Western culture, including contemporary understandings of gender, race and ethnicity, performance, nation, sexuality, and economies.

This course in the Morse Academic Plan (MAP) examines the common base and regional variations of Islamic societies. An \u201cIslamic society\u201d is here understood as one that shares, either as operative present or historical past, that common religious base called Islam. For Muslims, Islam is not simply a set of beliefs or observances, but also includes a history; its study is thus by nature historical, topical, and regional. The emphasis in the premodern period is first on the Quran and then on law, political theory, theology, and mysticism. For the more recent period, the stress is on the search for religious identity. Throughout, students are exposed to Islamic societies in the words of their own writings."}, {"content": "Featured Courses - Art and Art Professions - NYU Steinhardt                                                         Skip to content         NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development           apply now     request info     contact                                      Department of Art and Art Professions            NYU Art Facebook    NYU Art Twitter            Art and Art Professions                 MFA     MA          Art Education      Art Therapy      Costume Studies      Visual Arts Administration             Undergraduate          BFA Studio Art      Minors             About          Exhibitions      Events        Facilities      Faculty      Staff      Student Resources      Internships      Summer                                           Featured Courses       Go to the NYU Registration site for a complete listing of courses, course numbers, and call numbers.

Art: Practice and Ideas examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create &amp; reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting &amp; sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, &amp; computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, &amp; postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, &amp; technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical &amp; social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time. ARTCR-UE 0050 Modern Art and Contemporary Culture Examines the impact of modernism in both its historic &amp; contemporary relationships to culture &amp; society, through the study of painting, sculpture, architecture, &amp; the media arts from the late 1800&rsquo;s to the late 1950s. Art history with a theoretical &amp; aesthetic emphasis. Relates the art of the period to political, social, &amp; philosophical issues &amp; to current debates. Works of art are considered from slides, films, and reproductions. ART-UE 1914 Interdisciplinary Projects: Representation and Identity Open only to art majors or by permission. Prerequisite: three semesters of painting. Consideration of particular techniques allows students to broaden the range of their skills and expression. This is a studio class. Each week begins with a 20-minute discussion of current gallery or museum exhibitions that we have seen. Critiques will be every 3rd week. Students will be expected to work on their own ideas or projects. I will work with each student based on where they are in that process. Technical advice will be individual as well. Students are encourage to fully investigate their materials during this class. If there is a need for specific assignments this will be done on an individual basis. Students are encouraged to keep drawing journals and start a file of resource material with their paintings in mind. ART-UE 1391 Advanced Projects in Digital Art: \"Mind Remapping\" In this course, students will develop projects that use, critique and expand the notion and boundaries of digital media. The exploration of the mind's own processing of information will be a conceptual foundation for the course as we examine the ways in which digital tools mimic, respond to and amplify human desire. Media in the class will range from images and animation to video and music. The class will be an opportunity to both learn new tools and deepen skills already begun. Projects will be presented and discussed. ART-UE 1393 Advanced Projects in Art &amp; Media: &ldquo;Performance and Photo/Video&rdquo; This class will utilize each student&rsquo;s body in situ or in photography or video to demonstrate issues that transcend the particular aura of the individual and spread ideas into and from culture.
