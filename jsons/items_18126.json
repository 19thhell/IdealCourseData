A second award was made to the team of Columbia Universit y with Brookhaven National Laboratory , Stony Brook University , and Cornell University\u2019s NYC Tech . The third award was made to High Tech Rochester Inc. Each of the three awards is for $5 million and will be funded over 5 years. Per the press release : \"These centers will take innovation to the next stage, by connecting inventors and scientists with business mentors and potential investors,\u201d said Francis J. Murray Jr., President and CEO, NYSERDA. \u201cUnder Governor Cuomo\u2019s leadership, these centers will help turn good clean-energy ideas into cleantech companies ready to advance toward commercialization, which will in turn provide economic development and investment in New York\u2019s cleantech industry.\u201d The vision for these two Downstate centers, to be known collectively as PowerBridgeNY, is to leverage clean energy innovations emerging from institutional research labs to create more and stronger energy businesses in New York State. In order to achieve that goal, the two POCCs will work collaboratively to identify promising early stage technologies and fund translational work to advance these technologies towards technical validation. All awards will be made via a competitive process, overseen by a panel of objective external judges from industry, venture capital, and not-for-profits. The Centers will also provide a variety of services such as marketing, business planning, market research, mentoring and coaching, educational seminars, and discounts with service providers, to name a few. Start-ups emerging from these projects may be eligible for \u201cignition grants\u201d to fund early post-launch activities. Again from the press release : \u201cThe PowerBridge proof-of-concept-center is an important element in creating and fostering transformational entrepreneurship. With promising clean energy technology emerging from the School of Engineering, NYU, CUNY and others, and thanks to this exciting partnership with NYSERDA, we are pleased to connect researchers with investors, customers and partners who make this regional ecosystem so dynamic,\u201d said Katepalli Sreenivasan, the School of Engineering's Provost and NYU\u2019s Senior Vice Provost. \u201cNYU and the School of Engineering are committed to supporting start-up emerging technology ventures that will benefit the urban environment. This new center will enhance our entrepreneurial culture to drive new businesses, jobs and innovation, placing New York City at the forefront of the clean economy.\u201d NYU Poly is currently working with NYSERDA and our partner institutions on the formal contracting and other administrative matters for PowerBridgeNY. We anticipate that official center activities will begin with a call for proposals in September 2013, with the first awards being granted later that Fall.

Yet the energy system has historically evolved much more slowly than other technology-dependent sectors. It took eight decades for oil to overtake coal as the US primary energy source, while mp3s replaced CDs and tapes in only three years. If we aspire to improve the energy system, it is important understand both the reasons why our energy system changes so slowly and the motivations of those with the resources to affect true transformation.
