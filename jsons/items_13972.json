Waiver Criteria Applicable to All Other Students   (F1-J1 Visa holders, please see below.)     Students who maintain other ACA-compliant insurance coverage that is equal to or greater than that of the Basic Plan may choose to waive the NYU-sponsored plans by the appropriate deadline .   University Criteria for Waiving the NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plans include:   1. The insurance company must be headquartered and operating in the U.S., with a U.S. claims address and customer service telephone number. (LS Freshman Abroad students, see below.*)     2.

The plan must provide inpatient hospitalization benefits in the New York City area, including mental health benefits.   4. The plan must provide outpatient benefits in the New York City area (including office visits, outpatient mental health benefits and laboratory and radiology procedures). Coverage limited to emergency care does not satisfy the requirement.   5. The maximum benefit payable under the insurance plan must be unlimited.   * For students in the LS Freshman Abroad program, their insurance company or government-issued health plan must be headquartered in their home country.        How to Waive Online/Deadline:   The following information should be available before beginning the online waiver process during the appropriate time period (see below):     Student ID number (shown on the student\u2019s admissions letter or on the back of the NYU ID card), and   Health insurance ID card and information about benefits, exclusions and coverage dates for the student\u2019s other health insurance plan.

However, they must repeat the waiver process again at the start of each academic year beginning in the fall.   Once the waiver process is completed, the waiver will apply as of the effective date of insurance for the term. (Example: Students, who submit a waiver on September 15th, will not be covered for any services that were rendered on or after August 21st of that year.)   Waivers will only be processed by the Insurance Department. No school or unit can waive students from the insurance plan.

The Sample of Services (PDF) chart gives examples of the types of SHC services that are provided at no cost as well as those services for which there is a fee.     The NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Program has two components     Mandatory Plan (PDF) - The registration fee included on your tuition bill grants access to services at the Student Health Center as well as limited health insurance coverage for certain hospital emergency room services and mental health outpatient visits.   Optional Plans (PDF) - NYU sponsors three levels of student health insurance plans designed to provide reasonably priced healthcare coverage. The Basic, Comprehensive and GSHIP Plans (PDF) cover the same medical and mental health services. However, they have different:     reimbursement levels   out-of-pocket expenses           All plans offer coverage for services rendered by healthcare providers who participate in the MagnaCare and MultiPlan networks. Referrals are required for services in Manhattan (outside SHC) (see Referrals/Authorizations ). Out-of-network providers are also covered but at a lower reimbursement level. Please note: The NYU Student Health Center (SHC) is in-network under the Student Health Insurance Plans but will be considered out of network under all other plans which utilize the MagnaCare &amp; MultiPlan networks.   Students who are studying abroad with NYU programs are also eligible for the Study Abroad Health Insurance Plan (PDF) designed specifically to allow students easy access to care while outside the United States.

Waiver Criteria Applicable to All Other Students   (F1-J1 Visa holders, please see below.)     Students who maintain other ACA-compliant insurance coverage that is equal to or greater than that of the Basic Plan may choose to waive the NYU-sponsored plans by the appropriate deadline .   University Criteria for Waiving the NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plans include:   1. The insurance company must be headquartered and operating in the U.S., with a U.S. claims address and customer service telephone number. (LS Freshman Abroad students, see below.*)     2.

The plan must provide inpatient hospitalization benefits in the New York City area, including mental health benefits.   4. The plan must provide outpatient benefits in the New York City area (including office visits, outpatient mental health benefits and laboratory and radiology procedures). Coverage limited to emergency care does not satisfy the requirement.   5. The maximum benefit payable under the insurance plan must be unlimited.   * For students in the LS Freshman Abroad program, their insurance company or government-issued health plan must be headquartered in their home country.        How to Waive Online/Deadline:   The following information should be available before beginning the online waiver process during the appropriate time period (see below):     Student ID number (shown on the student\u2019s admissions letter or on the back of the NYU ID card), and   Health insurance ID card and information about benefits, exclusions and coverage dates for the student\u2019s other health insurance plan.

However, they must repeat the waiver process again at the start of each academic year beginning in the fall.   Once the waiver process is completed, the waiver will apply as of the effective date of insurance for the term. (Example: Students, who submit a waiver on September 15th, will not be covered for any services that were rendered on or after August 21st of that year.)   Waivers will only be processed by the Insurance Department. No school or unit can waive students from the insurance plan.

The Sample of Services (PDF) chart gives examples of the types of SHC services that are provided at no cost as well as those services for which there is a fee.     The NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Program has two components     Mandatory Plan (PDF) - The registration fee included on your tuition bill grants access to services at the Student Health Center as well as limited health insurance coverage for certain hospital emergency room services and mental health outpatient visits.   Optional Plans (PDF) - NYU sponsors three levels of student health insurance plans designed to provide reasonably priced healthcare coverage. The Basic, Comprehensive and GSHIP Plans (PDF) cover the same medical and mental health services. However, they have different:     reimbursement levels   out-of-pocket expenses           All plans offer coverage for services rendered by healthcare providers who participate in the MagnaCare and MultiPlan networks. Referrals are required for services in Manhattan (outside SHC) (see Referrals/Authorizations ). Out-of-network providers are also covered but at a lower reimbursement level. Please note: The NYU Student Health Center (SHC) is in-network under the Student Health Insurance Plans but will be considered out of network under all other plans which utilize the MagnaCare &amp; MultiPlan networks.   Students who are studying abroad with NYU programs are also eligible for the Study Abroad Health Insurance Plan (PDF) designed specifically to allow students easy access to care while outside the United States.

Waiver Criteria Applicable to All Other Students   (F1-J1 Visa holders, please see below.)     Students who maintain other ACA-compliant insurance coverage that is equal to or greater than that of the Basic Plan may choose to waive the NYU-sponsored plans by the appropriate deadline .   University Criteria for Waiving the NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plans include:   1. The insurance company must be headquartered and operating in the U.S., with a U.S. claims address and customer service telephone number. (LS Freshman Abroad students, see below.*)     2. The insurance coverage must remain in effect from:            Semester  Insurance Effective Dates  Fall August 21st through August 20th of the following year  Spring January 9th through  August 20th  Summer May 14th through  August 20th       3. The plan must provide inpatient hospitalization benefits in the New York City area, including mental health benefits.   4. The plan must provide outpatient benefits in the New York City area (including office visits, outpatient mental health benefits and laboratory and radiology procedures). Coverage limited to emergency care does not satisfy the requirement.   5.

However, they must repeat the waiver process again at the start of each academic year beginning in the fall.   Once the waiver process is completed, the waiver will apply as of the effective date of insurance for the term. (Example: Students, who submit a waiver on September 15th, will not be covered for any services that were rendered on or after August 21st of that year.)   Waivers will only be processed by the Insurance Department. No school or unit can waive students from the insurance plan.

If students enroll in an NYU-sponsored plan before the September 30th fall deadline, they may choose from the following payment options:   A. ANNUAL PAYMENT IN FULL at the time of fall registration, with no insurance charge at spring registration.     Students will continue coverage through August 20th, even if they are not registered for spring classes. (However, they will not have access to services at the Student Health Center after January 8th for January graduates and after mid-May for May graduates.)   Students cannot get a partial refund of the spring/summer portion of the annual premium after the September 30th enrollment deadline.       B. TWO-INSTALLMENT PAYMENT PLAN (default plan):   The first payment at the time of fall registration, and the second at spring registration. The spring premium is higher than the fall premium since it includes payment for coverage over the summer months.     Students will be automatically enrolled in the same plan and billed the spring/summer health insurance premium if, and only if, they are registered for classes or maintaining matriculation for the following spring semester.   Students who are not registered for classes or maintaining matriculation for spring will have their insurance coverage end on January 8th. Click here to review options for continuing coverage.   The insurance premium cannot be prorated separately for spring and summer.     Whether payment option A or B is chosen, students may not change plans until the beginning of the next academic year.   Dependents:   Students enrolling dependents in an NYU plan before the fall term deadline may choose an installment payment option. For students choosing this option:     The policy coverage is annual and the spring term payment is required in order for coverage to be effective and continuous through August 20th of the following year.   Students will receive a 30-day notice before their fall coverage ends with a request for payment for the spring term coverage.   Students must send the appropriate payment for the spring term by January 8th. If no payment is received by January 8th, a letter will be sent informing them that their dependent coverage has been terminated.
