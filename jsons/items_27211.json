Search relevant keywords in catalogs, indexes, search engines, and   full-text resources. Useful both to narrow a search to the specific   subject heading and to find sources not captured under a relevant subject   heading. To search a database effectively, start with a Keyword search,   find relevant records, and then find relevant Subject Headings. In search   engines, include many keywords to narrow the search and carefully evaluate   what you find.        Subject searches in online and   print sources . Subject Headings (sometimes called   Descriptors) are specific terms or phrases used consistently by online or   print indexes to describe what a book or journal article is about. This is   true of the Library&rsquo;s Online Catalog as well as Proquest or the Reader&rsquo;s   Guide or other indexes. For   example, in the online catalog, DIVORCE and CHILDREN OF DIVORCED PARENTS   are different subject headings with different books under them. If you want the latter and find the   specific subject heading, you&rsquo;ll save time finding the most relevant   resources. DIVORCE as a Keyword in   the Online Catalog will pick up both topics above, but also about 1300   other catalog records with the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; in them.        Citation searches in printed   sources . Track down footnotes, endnotes, and   citations in relevant readings. Search for specific books or journals in   the Library&rsquo;s Online Catalog. This technique helps you become part of the   scholarly conversation on a particular topic.        Searches through published   bibliographies    (including sets of footnotes in relevant subject documents). Published bibliographies on particular   subjects (Shakespeare, alcoholism, etc.) often list sources missed through   other kinds of searches. BIBLIOGRAPHY is a subject heading in the Online   Catalog, so a Guided Search with BIBLIOGRAPHY as a Subject and your topic   as a keyword will help you find these.        Searches through people sources (whether by verbal contact,   e-mail, electronic bulletin board, letters, etc.). People are often more   willing to help than you might think. The people to start with are often   Reference Librarians at the Reference Desks in the Library.        Systematic browsing, especially   of full-text sources arranged in predictable subject groupings . Libraries organize books by   subject, with similar books shelved together. Browsing the stacks is a good way to   find similar books; however, in large libraries, some books are not in the   main stacks, so use the catalog as well.        The  advantages of trying all these research methods are that:        Each of these ways of searching   is applicable in any subject area   None of them is confined   exclusively to English-language sources   Each has both strengths and   weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages   The weaknesses within any one   method are balanced by the strengths of the others   The strength of each is   precisely that it is capable of turning up information or knowledge   records that cannot be found efficiently&mdash;or often even at all&mdash;by any of   the others             Comments (0)                                         How to get started// Oxford encyclopedia                  Credo Reference Online collection of dictionaries, encyclopedias, biographical sources, quotations, bilingual dictionaries, and measurement conversions covering topics from the arts to the sciences.

They make it easier to find related material, by providing standardized  terms for searching, and by providing a structure for describing  relationships between concepts. The subject headings published by the  Library of Congress are used in most libraries in North America, and  many around the world. Knowing the LC terms relating to your topic can  help you to find material in many library collections. Here are some examples of headings that may be of interest for this class.   Subjects: Historical drama -- 20th century -- History and    criticism.    Historical drama -- 20th century.    Dramatists -- 20th century -- Interviews.    Realism in literature.    Politics in literature.

Comments (0)                                         Limiting to \"Peer Reviewed\" Articles                 \"Peer reviewed\" (or \"refereed\" journals) are those that subject content to a critical review by other experts in the field prior to accepting a manuscript for publication. Thus, limiting your literature search to the peer-reviewed journals ensures a higher level of scholarship and research methodology. Magazines, trade journals, and newspapers tend to be \"non-peer-reviewed,\" meaning perhaps just the editor or someone who is not an expert in the field has reviewed the content before publishing. How do you know if a journal citation is from a peer-reviewed journal?     You can do a journal title search in Ulrich's Global Serials Directory . The symbol: indicates a journal is \"refereed\"   You can look for the \"Limits\" feature in many databases to narrow search results by publication type.

Primary sources enable the researcher to get as close as possible to the truth of what  actually happened during an historical event or time period. Primary source is a term used in a number of disciplines to describe source material that is closest to the person, information, period, or idea being studied. A primary source (also called original source ) is a document, recording, artifact, or other source of information that was created at the time under study, usually by a source with direct personal knowledge of the events being described. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions are used in library science , and other areas of scholarship. In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources , which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources, though the distinction is not a sharp one.

There are a number of different options for formatting citations. Certain bibliographic styles correspond to certain disciplines, and you often may have a specific style assigned to you for a project. However, the most important thing to remember is that your citation style must be consistent throughout a single paper.

Search relevant keywords in catalogs, indexes, search engines, and   full-text resources. Useful both to narrow a search to the specific   subject heading and to find sources not captured under a relevant subject   heading. To search a database effectively, start with a Keyword search,   find relevant records, and then find relevant Subject Headings. In search   engines, include many keywords to narrow the search and carefully evaluate   what you find.        Subject searches in online and   print sources . Subject Headings (sometimes called   Descriptors) are specific terms or phrases used consistently by online or   print indexes to describe what a book or journal article is about. This is   true of the Library&rsquo;s Online Catalog as well as Proquest or the Reader&rsquo;s   Guide or other indexes. For   example, in the online catalog, DIVORCE and CHILDREN OF DIVORCED PARENTS   are different subject headings with different books under them. If you want the latter and find the   specific subject heading, you&rsquo;ll save time finding the most relevant   resources. DIVORCE as a Keyword in   the Online Catalog will pick up both topics above, but also about 1300   other catalog records with the word &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; in them.        Citation searches in printed   sources . Track down footnotes, endnotes, and   citations in relevant readings. Search for specific books or journals in   the Library&rsquo;s Online Catalog. This technique helps you become part of the   scholarly conversation on a particular topic.        Searches through published   bibliographies    (including sets of footnotes in relevant subject documents). Published bibliographies on particular   subjects (Shakespeare, alcoholism, etc.) often list sources missed through   other kinds of searches. BIBLIOGRAPHY is a subject heading in the Online   Catalog, so a Guided Search with BIBLIOGRAPHY as a Subject and your topic   as a keyword will help you find these.        Searches through people sources (whether by verbal contact,   e-mail, electronic bulletin board, letters, etc.). People are often more   willing to help than you might think. The people to start with are often   Reference Librarians at the Reference Desks in the Library.        Systematic browsing, especially   of full-text sources arranged in predictable subject groupings . Libraries organize books by   subject, with similar books shelved together. Browsing the stacks is a good way to   find similar books; however, in large libraries, some books are not in the   main stacks, so use the catalog as well.        The  advantages of trying all these research methods are that:        Each of these ways of searching   is applicable in any subject area   None of them is confined   exclusively to English-language sources   Each has both strengths and   weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages   The weaknesses within any one   method are balanced by the strengths of the others   The strength of each is   precisely that it is capable of turning up information or knowledge   records that cannot be found efficiently&mdash;or often even at all&mdash;by any of   the others             Comments (0)                                         How to get started// Oxford encyclopedia                  Credo Reference Online collection of dictionaries, encyclopedias, biographical sources, quotations, bilingual dictionaries, and measurement conversions covering topics from the arts to the sciences.

Thus, limiting your literature search to the peer-reviewed journals ensures a higher level of scholarship and research methodology. Magazines, trade journals, and newspapers tend to be \"non-peer-reviewed,\" meaning perhaps just the editor or someone who is not an expert in the field has reviewed the content before publishing. How do you know if a journal citation is from a peer-reviewed journal?     You can do a journal title search in Ulrich's Global Serials Directory . The symbol: indicates a journal is \"refereed\"   You can look for the \"Limits\" feature in many databases to narrow search results by publication type.

If you are looking for a particular type of monologue, try combining the word monologues with a descriptive keyword, such as: monologues and men, monologues and women, monologues and classical and monologues and contemporary, etc.   I'd recommend using the Play Index.

Primary sources enable the researcher to get as close as possible to the truth of what  actually happened during an historical event or time period. Primary source is a term used in a number of disciplines to describe source material that is closest to the person, information, period, or idea being studied. A primary source (also called original source ) is a document, recording, artifact, or other source of information that was created at the time under study, usually by a source with direct personal knowledge of the events being described. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions are used in library science , and other areas of scholarship. In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources , which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources, though the distinction is not a sharp one.
