Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Palmeiro (NYU Buenos Aires)  syllabus  Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU Madrid)  syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9547, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multicultural France Prof. Epstein (NYU Paris)  syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \u201crace,\u201d identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9548, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague\u2014in the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU Prague)  syllabus*  The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU London)  syllabus  The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Edelstein (NYU Florence)  syllabus In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We also consider films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Two Laws (1982) and The Tracker (2002). Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples, including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971) as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood (2008). Spring 2015 Spring 2015 CORE-UA 9515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Palmeiro (NYU Buenos Aires)  syllabus * Over   the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced   extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape,   a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency,   state repression, popular resistance and social movements.

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Palmer (NYU Florence)  syllabus Through the study of primary texts, we examine how Italians registered their own similarities and differences within a national context, and how they regarded the tourists, students, soldiers, and immigrants who have come in increasing numbers to Italy. We also consider the accounts of foreign visitors to Italy from the eighteenth-century until today, both from the perspective of western tourists seeking \u201cculture\u201d and through the eyes of immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and beyond. The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city. Spring 2015 CORE-UA.9720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Beckett (NYU London)  syllabus Contemporary Art in Britian. Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? We consider some key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries, exploring art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography, representations of the body, gallery display, video practice, and installation art. Topics include how contemporary art came to look as it does, with a focus on British art; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; and how markets, national prizes, and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries, and issues of curation. Critical and historical writings by artists and theorists will be considered. Spring 2015 CORE-UA.9722, Expressive Culture: Architecture in London Field Study Prof. Powers (NYU London)  syllabus The history of London architecture as exemplified by surviving buildings, which can be seen and visited, principally from the 17th to the 20th centuries, considered through an equal mixture of classroom lectures and field study visits to the sites and buildings, and types of buildings, discussed in the lectures.

Spring 2015 CORE-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Metcalf (NYU Washington D.C.)  syllabus* Film and American Politics: Introduces students to the formal study of film while exploring the changing popular vision of American politics that is seen in films about Washington, D. C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d Note: * indicates draft/sample syllabus           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Global Academic Centers    | The College Core Curriculum, College of Arts and Science | New York Univeristy                          NEW YORK UNIVERSITY     ARTS AND SCIENCE     COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE     GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE             The College Core Curriculum            Back to Home       Global Academic Centers | 2013-2014 Fall 2013  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9510 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia\u2014Between East and West Prof. Salamon (NYU Prague)  syllabus The complex evolution of Russian cultural identity explored in juxtaposition to parallel developments of other Eastern European cultures, highlighting the emergence of individual and collective self struggling for freedom of self-determination within the context of societies which for cultural, religious, or political reasons hinder such aspirations, and examined through some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe.

Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts   of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers   have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched   detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples,   including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema   history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971)   as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first   feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived   interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood   (2008). SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Metcalf (NYU Washington)  syllabus Film and American Politics: Introduces students to the formal study of film while exploring the changing popular vision of American politics that is seen in films about Washington, D. C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Palmeiro (NYU Buenos Aires)  syllabus  Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU Madrid)  syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9547, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multicultural France Prof. Epstein (NYU Paris)  syllabus France and the U.S. have a habit of looking at one another as anti-models when it comes to discussions of assimilation and difference, \u201crace,\u201d identity, community, and diversity. We explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? Why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we study the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9548, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague\u2014in the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU Prague)  syllabus*  The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU London)  syllabus  The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Edelstein (NYU Florence)  syllabus In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009).

SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Palmer (NYU Florence)  syllabus Through the study of primary texts, we examine how Italians registered their own similarities and differences within a national context, and how they regarded the tourists, students, soldiers, and immigrants who have come in increasing numbers to Italy. We also consider the accounts of foreign visitors to Italy from the eighteenth-century until today, both from the perspective of western tourists seeking \u201cculture\u201d and through the eyes of immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and beyond. The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city. Spring 2015 CORE-UA.9720, Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Beckett (NYU London)  syllabus Contemporary Art in Britian. Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? We consider some key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries, exploring art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography, representations of the body, gallery display, video practice, and installation art. Topics include how contemporary art came to look as it does, with a focus on British art; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; and how markets, national prizes, and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries, and issues of curation. Critical and historical writings by artists and theorists will be considered. Spring 2015 CORE-UA.9722, Expressive Culture: Architecture in London Field Study Prof. Powers (NYU London)  syllabus The history of London architecture as exemplified by surviving buildings, which can be seen and visited, principally from the 17th to the 20th centuries, considered through an equal mixture of classroom lectures and field study visits to the sites and buildings, and types of buildings, discussed in the lectures.

SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city.  SPRING 2014  CORE -UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How   has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested   historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a   critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the   legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding   Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as   Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through   films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about   the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo   (2009). We also consider films that have employed innovative narrative   and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past   and the present such as Two Laws (1982) and The Tracker (2002).   Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts   of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers   have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched   detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples,   including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema   history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971)   as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first   feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived   interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood   (2008). SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Metcalf (NYU Washington)  syllabus Film and American Politics: Introduces students to the formal study of film while exploring the changing popular vision of American politics that is seen in films about Washington, D. C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
