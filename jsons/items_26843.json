At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies.

What is Sexual Misconduct?                                        ALWAYS MAKE   SURE YOU   HAVE CONSENT.                                  Prohibited conduct in NYU's Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy includes sexual or gender-based harassment, sexual assault, and sexual exploitation. Also prohibited are relationship violence, stalking, and retaliation.   Sexual assault is having or attempting to have sexual contact with another individual by force or threat of force, without consent, or where that individual is incapacitated.   Sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favors, or other unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, whether verbal, non-verbal, graphic, physical, or otherwise.   Gender-based harassment includes harassment based on gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, which may include acts of aggression, intimidation, or hostility, whether verbal or non-verbal, graphic, physical, or otherwise, even if the acts do not involve conduct of a sexual nature.   For the full definitions of these prohibited behaviors \u2014 as well as the definitions of sexual exploitation, relationship violence, stalking, and retaliation \u2014 see NYU's Sexual Misconduct, Relationship Violence, and Stalking Policy , which every member of the NYU community is urged and expected to read.
