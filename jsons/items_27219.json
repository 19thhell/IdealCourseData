It will enable students to develop a greater understanding of how performance has meaning to daily life and how it can shape both a social and political landscape. As such, the class environment provides an excellent opportunity for peers and instructors alike to interact with one another across fields, and to explore chosen topics together using a variety of skill-sets from a variety of perspectives.  Students will be able to strengthen their skills of analysis by investigating the performance practices and events of different cultures around the world, concentrating on everything from theatrical performances to cultural and religious rituals, to the use of performance as a means of political activism.     The Performance Studies Minor curriculum consists of no less than 18 points of credit.
