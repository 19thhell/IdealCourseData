G29.2600, G51.2600      This seminar examines the history of music and music  theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy, and criticism.  Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a privileged metaphor  in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation of  verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and   Universalpoesie ; Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the tone-poem;  secularization and the rise of chromatization; the  semiotics of music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural  contexts will be presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are  developed, including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy  or singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of  verbal language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d  of music; patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close  reading of Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical of, while being  thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.

G29.2610.001, G95.2610      Continuation of:   Toward Rethinking the Renaissance: Metaphor, Creation, and Subversion    Reiss, 4 pts   G29.2155, G45.2155, G57.2154, G95.2966.002      This  seminar is an experiment. The instructor will try to trace the establishment  and meaning of \u201cRenaissance\u201d by following the fortunes of a metaphor over  several hundred years. In the metaphor of \u201cbird islands\u201d he sees made visible  the complexities and anxieties of half a millennium of usually-violent  cross-cultural intersections, gradually clarified, perhaps never quite  understood. This metaphor began to acquire a potential for these meanings in  the twelfth century and reached full complexity in the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries. This presupposes, too, analysis and discussion of the meaning(s) of  \u201cmetaphor.\u201d Tracing this particular metaphor will let us study a panoply of events, agents and dilemmas thought by  historians to define a \u201cEuropean\u201d Renaissance. These in fact compose a history  that is Muslim from the Levant to far Asia, Christian Mediterranean, Atlantic  island, West African and American \u2013 at the least.      The  events include, vitally but not exclusively: trade and dynastic movements from  the eleventh century; establishment and expansion of Islam, religious  imperialism, Crusade and sacramental claim; colonial expansion and settlement  (also from about the eleventh century); Mediterranean, West African, Atlantic  and Indian-Ocean voyaging, from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. Their  agents range from Islamic rulers and thinkers to Christian Crusaders; Venetian,  Genoese, Iberian and other mariners and merchants to African dynasts and  artists; Arab thinkers and writers across the dar   al-Islam to western Mediterranean  explorers; Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors and missionaries to Nahua and Tupi fighters and  artists. Among the dilemmas are those of otherness, identity and personhood;  ideas of society and barbarism; vernaculars of language, experience and  understanding; \u201ctasks\u201d and place of history and poetry; nature of experience; aporias of mediation and expression; aesthetic and  political anxieties....      The  initial guiding element for the seminar will be the instructor\u2019s metaphor. It  will be studied in writers starting with Columbus, Las Casas  and Zurara, going back to Arab sources and on to  Petrarch, Boccaccio and others in the 14th-15th centuries, to Vespucci, Gonneville, Cartier, Thevet, L\u00e9ry and others in the 16th (a preliminary bibliography  will be made available before the seminar\u2019s start). Seminar participants will  not be expected to echo the instructor\u2019s trajectory, but to take off from these  events and agents in order to explore whatever dilemmas and whomever of those  caught in them are of particular interest to the participant\u2019s own researches.      The  seminar\u2019s four credits will accrue over two semesters, with students  registering in the fall and receiving grades at the completion of the spring  session. (There will be no spring registration for this course.) The instructor will be present in New York in the Fall and Spring semesters for two weeks each. On both  occasions, the instructor will give a public lecture and meet with students individually, the seminar will meet four times. The public  lectures will be integral to the seminar, which will thus meet as a group ten  times during the year. Discussion will however continue through the year via  Blackboard, on email and if needed by telephone. Besides this ongoing debate,  students will be expected to write one book review on a recent volume in their  chosen area of study during the first semester and the usual term paper in the  course or at the end of the second semester. At least an opening syllabus  will be available by the beginning of the Fall 2007  semester.      Contemporary  Critical Theories: Ranci\u00e8re and the Post-Althusserians    Ross , 4 pts.   G29.1560, G45.1560      In  this seminar we will be primarily concerned with the work of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re. We will read a selection of his writings,  including his attack on Althusser, his historical  writings associated with R\u00e9voltes Logiques,  and his more recent political and aesthetic essays. Some attention will be paid  to his critical works on film and literature. We will situate Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s writing in the context of the work of Louis Althusser, and of the other post-Althusserians  in Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s cohort: Balibar,  Badiou, Macherey, and Terray.      Theory of the Novel: Narrative Ontologies    Ruttenburg , 4 pts   G29.2300.001, G41.2957    Primarily for PhD candidates: permission of instructor required for MA  candidates.       Literary Theory: Subjectivity and Resistance:    Lu Xun and Motifs of Non-Western Modernism    Zhang , 4 pts.   G29.3610, G33.3610, G65.3610      This  is a doctoral seminar which continues the critical rethinking of questions of  comparison and comparability (conducted in Spring 07 seminar) but from the  perspectives of area studies and, in particular, non-Western modernism.   The organizing ideas of the seminar begin with the Hegelian-Nietzschean  assumption that comparison is an integral part of the tension of modernity, and  thus is at its most stressful, substantial, and productive when it reaches a  \u201clife-and death\u201d conflict and negotiation between the Self  and Other. This assumption is then historically and critically examined  through a close reading of Lu Xun, a central figure  of modern Chinese literature and thought, in which resistance and guarding of a  suspended Chinese tradition, the literary-philosophical formulation of an  emergent collective subject-position were to be achieved by recognizing,  adopting and negotiating with what is regarded as \u201cnormative\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d  represented by the modern West. While the general framework of the  seminar is theoretical in nature, the discussions will be based on concrete  discussions on various issues, images, and ideas embedded in Lu Xun\u2019s texts, from early stories and prose poems to the  social-political essays.       The  seminar begins with a series of framing lectures by the instructor laying out  the historical and theoretical contexts and stakes of rereading Lu Xun. This long introduction will then be followed by  a series of student presentations on individual texts or cluster of texts  organized around a theme, with the instructor playing the role of a moderator  and commentator. Grades will be based on 3-4 bi-weekly response papers  (3-5) during the weeks of lecture; and a substantive presentation (45-60  minutes) in the second half of the semester.       Readings  include major works and texts by Lu Xun in English  translation and a supplementary packet of theoretical writings relevant to the  discussion.

G29.2600, G51.2600      This seminar examines the history of music and music  theory in specific relation to German literature, philosophy, and criticism.  Particular focus is given to the employment of music as a privileged metaphor  in literary projects as well as music\u2019s distance from and appropriation of  verbal and linguistic structures. Session topics include: theories of the  harmony of the spheres; synaesthesia, Romanticism and   Universalpoesie ; Wagner, tragedy and the Gesamtkunstwerk ; absolute music and the tone-poem;  secularization and the rise of chromatization; the  semiotics of music; and music and psychoanalysis. Historical and cultural  contexts will be presented as a number of predominant theoretical questions are  developed, including but not limited to the following: the presumed immediacy  or singularity of musical expression versus the mediation or abstraction of  verbal language; the relation of tonal language and text; the reciprocal,  philosophical critique of music and poetry; the \u201cliteralization\u201d  of music; patriotism, nationalism, and racism. The course ends with a close  reading of Thomas Mann\u2019s Doktor Faustus , a novel that is profoundly critical of, while being  thoroughly informed by, the tradition outlined here.

G29.2610.001, G95.2610      Continuation of:   Toward Rethinking the Renaissance: Metaphor, Creation, and Subversion    Reiss, 4 pts   G29.2155, G45.2155, G57.2154, G95.2966.002      This  seminar is an experiment. The instructor will try to trace the establishment  and meaning of \u201cRenaissance\u201d by following the fortunes of a metaphor over  several hundred years. In the metaphor of \u201cbird islands\u201d he sees made visible  the complexities and anxieties of half a millennium of usually-violent  cross-cultural intersections, gradually clarified, perhaps never quite  understood. This metaphor began to acquire a potential for these meanings in  the twelfth century and reached full complexity in the fifteenth and sixteenth  centuries. This presupposes, too, analysis and discussion of the meaning(s) of  \u201cmetaphor.\u201d Tracing this particular metaphor will let us study a panoply of events, agents and dilemmas thought by  historians to define a \u201cEuropean\u201d Renaissance. These in fact compose a history  that is Muslim from the Levant to far Asia, Christian Mediterranean, Atlantic  island, West African and American \u2013 at the least.      The  events include, vitally but not exclusively: trade and dynastic movements from  the eleventh century; establishment and expansion of Islam, religious  imperialism, Crusade and sacramental claim; colonial expansion and settlement  (also from about the eleventh century); Mediterranean, West African, Atlantic  and Indian-Ocean voyaging, from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. Their  agents range from Islamic rulers and thinkers to Christian Crusaders; Venetian,  Genoese, Iberian and other mariners and merchants to African dynasts and  artists; Arab thinkers and writers across the dar   al-Islam to western Mediterranean  explorers; Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors and missionaries to Nahua and Tupi fighters and  artists. Among the dilemmas are those of otherness, identity and personhood;  ideas of society and barbarism; vernaculars of language, experience and  understanding; \u201ctasks\u201d and place of history and poetry; nature of experience; aporias of mediation and expression; aesthetic and  political anxieties....      The  initial guiding element for the seminar will be the instructor\u2019s metaphor. It  will be studied in writers starting with Columbus, Las Casas  and Zurara, going back to Arab sources and on to  Petrarch, Boccaccio and others in the 14th-15th centuries, to Vespucci, Gonneville, Cartier, Thevet, L\u00e9ry and others in the 16th (a preliminary bibliography  will be made available before the seminar\u2019s start). Seminar participants will  not be expected to echo the instructor\u2019s trajectory, but to take off from these  events and agents in order to explore whatever dilemmas and whomever of those  caught in them are of particular interest to the participant\u2019s own researches.      The  seminar\u2019s four credits will accrue over two semesters, with students  registering in the fall and receiving grades at the completion of the spring  session. (There will be no spring registration for this course.) The instructor will be present in New York in the Fall and Spring semesters for two weeks each. On both  occasions, the instructor will give a public lecture and meet with students individually, the seminar will meet four times. The public  lectures will be integral to the seminar, which will thus meet as a group ten  times during the year. Discussion will however continue through the year via  Blackboard, on email and if needed by telephone. Besides this ongoing debate,  students will be expected to write one book review on a recent volume in their  chosen area of study during the first semester and the usual term paper in the  course or at the end of the second semester. At least an opening syllabus  will be available by the beginning of the Fall 2007  semester.      Contemporary  Critical Theories: Ranci\u00e8re and the Post-Althusserians    Ross , 4 pts.   G29.1560, G45.1560      In  this seminar we will be primarily concerned with the work of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re. We will read a selection of his writings,  including his attack on Althusser, his historical  writings associated with R\u00e9voltes Logiques,  and his more recent political and aesthetic essays. Some attention will be paid  to his critical works on film and literature. We will situate Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s writing in the context of the work of Louis Althusser, and of the other post-Althusserians  in Ranci\u00e8re\u2019s cohort: Balibar,  Badiou, Macherey, and Terray.      Theory of the Novel: Narrative Ontologies    Ruttenburg , 4 pts   G29.2300.001, G41.2957    Primarily for PhD candidates: permission of instructor required for MA  candidates.       Literary Theory: Subjectivity and Resistance:    Lu Xun and Motifs of Non-Western Modernism    Zhang , 4 pts.   G29.3610, G33.3610, G65.3610      This  is a doctoral seminar which continues the critical rethinking of questions of  comparison and comparability (conducted in Spring 07 seminar) but from the  perspectives of area studies and, in particular, non-Western modernism.   The organizing ideas of the seminar begin with the Hegelian-Nietzschean  assumption that comparison is an integral part of the tension of modernity, and  thus is at its most stressful, substantial, and productive when it reaches a  \u201clife-and death\u201d conflict and negotiation between the Self  and Other. This assumption is then historically and critically examined  through a close reading of Lu Xun, a central figure  of modern Chinese literature and thought, in which resistance and guarding of a  suspended Chinese tradition, the literary-philosophical formulation of an  emergent collective subject-position were to be achieved by recognizing,  adopting and negotiating with what is regarded as \u201cnormative\u201d or \u201cuniversal\u201d  represented by the modern West. While the general framework of the  seminar is theoretical in nature, the discussions will be based on concrete  discussions on various issues, images, and ideas embedded in Lu Xun\u2019s texts, from early stories and prose poems to the  social-political essays.       The  seminar begins with a series of framing lectures by the instructor laying out  the historical and theoretical contexts and stakes of rereading Lu Xun. This long introduction will then be followed by  a series of student presentations on individual texts or cluster of texts  organized around a theme, with the instructor playing the role of a moderator  and commentator. Grades will be based on 3-4 bi-weekly response papers  (3-5) during the weeks of lecture; and a substantive presentation (45-60  minutes) in the second half of the semester.       Readings  include major works and texts by Lu Xun in English  translation and a supplementary packet of theoretical writings relevant to the  discussion.
