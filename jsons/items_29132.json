Controversially recorded in 1985 (and released in 1986) in a collaborative format in South Africa in defiance of the UN cultural boycott, the album is a highly complex amalgam of Simon's trademark cerebral, interior lyrics super-imposed upon pulsating Africa rhythms played by South Africa's top instrumental musicians; Louisiana zydeco; and special cameos by artists ranging from Linda Ronstadt to the Everly Brothers. Graceland won the Grammy for album of the year, bolstering Simon's career in the process but serious questions were raised about the nature of the cross-cultural/cross-national project. Was it a genuine collaboration that benefited both Simon and his African colleagues, or was this the latest form of musical exploitation and colonialism? As the album that inaugurated the world music debated that still remain with us, Graceland - now celebrating its 25th anniversary - is worthy of in-depth academic scrutiny. This class proposes to put the album and its associated debates in full cultural, political and musical context. We will look at Simon's prolific pre- Graceland career and the rise of world music and globalization in the 1980s - also paying some attention to the volatile cultural politics of south Africa in the 1980s. We will then study Graceland itself and delve into the controversy. And finally we will look at world music, culture and politics in the aftermath of Graceland. Students should expect to leave the class with an enriched understanding of the role that Western musicians play in an increasingly complex trans-national world system, where forms of collaboration and artistic exchange are fraught with as much promise as they are with challenge.

They tend to scuff up my toes as    I frantically claw at the bottoms in a perceived attempt to keep them on. Such is typical for these sorts of    sandals. The front decoration is nice, and the only thing I can really complain about is that the light    greenish color is hard to match. If you care about matching.              (c) 2005 by AMW.
