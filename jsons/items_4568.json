[{"detail": [{"content": "Appeared in Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, Issue issue, no. 185. Vol. 47, no. 1 (Winter 1998), special issues on klezmer  music, pp. 49-788.  ------------------  Sounds of Sensibility  Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett  Today's klezmer scene, while it affirms a degree of  musical continuity with the past, is in fact the result of an  experience of rupture. Reviewing The Klezmorim's first  album, East Side Wedding, in 1977, Nat Hentoff  commented that \"For years now, I had thought the  klezmorim to be nearly extinct. Oh, some old players  must still be boldly wailing in some dwindling Orthodox  Jewish neighborhoods, but surely they are the last of their  line.\" When he heard them, he \"would close his eyes and  grin at the ghosts of my clan in Minsk and Pinsk.\" Now,  he continued, a new generation has \"taken up and merrily  revivified this heritage.\"1 At the time, Hentoff heard the  past. Years later, Lev Liberman, who co-founded The  Klezmorim in 1975, would look back and see harbingers  of the future: \"I'd like to think that the current klezmer  revival had its origins in our early experiments with tight  ensemble playing, improvisation, klezmer/jazz fusions,  neo-klezmer composition, street music, world beat, and  New Vaudeville.\"2   In the hiatus between the old and the new players can  be found keys to changes of sensibility that have made  today's scene possible. Whatever their ostensible subject,  the essays in this issue sound the sensibilities specific to  the klezmer phenomenon of the last twenty-five years.  They show \"klezmer music\" to be a powerful index of  what Raymond Williams has called changing structures of  feeling. Williams distinguishes feeling (\"meanings and  values as they are actively lived and felt\") from ideology  (\"formally held and systematic beliefs\"), noting that they  are of course interrelated in practice: \"Methodologically,  then, a 'structure of feeling' is a cultural hypothesis,  actually derived from attempts to understand such  elements [affective elements of consciousness and  relationships] and their connection in a generation or  period, and needing always to be returned, interactively,  to such evidence.\"3 The essays gathered here provide rich  evidence of just such \"affective elements of  consciousness\" and their historical location.  My essay explores the historical formation of the  klezmer phenomenon in terms of changing structures of  feeling. I begin by considering arguments over  terminology--not only the term klezmer, but also the word  revival--and how these debates situate klezmer music  within a larger musical landscape. I then relate the  klezmer phenomenon to what Haim Soloveitchik has  called the end of self-evident Jewishness.4 While  stringent orthodoxy is one outcome of the tension between  tradition and ideology, the klezmer revival is another.  There follows an analysis of the fault lines of sensibility  in the period immediately preceding the klezmer revival.  While the popularity of old-time Jewish wedding music  declined and an incipient heritage orientation to it can be  detected within the Jewish music world of the time, this  music was notably absent from the folk song and music  revivals of the fifties and sixties. To better understand this  absence, I contrast the musical sensibilities of Theodore  Bikel, an international folk singer who specialized in  Yiddish, Hebrew, and Russian songs, and Mickey Katz,  who performed English-Yiddish comedy and musical  parodies for a largely Jewish audience. Seen not as a  musical wasteland, but as a plenum of shifting  sensibilities, the fifties and sixties hold clues to the  emergence of the klezmer revival in the seventies, its  efflorescence in the nineties, and its changing character in  the United States and in the \"Jewish space\" of Europe  today.5    The Klezmer Phenomenon  What to call this scene and how to characterize the music  are matters of ongoing debate. As Williams writes of  keywords more generally, the term klezmer is tangled up  with the phenomenon it is being used to discuss.6 While  klezmer music, klezmer musicians, and klezmer revival  are commonly heard terms, Andy Statman recently said  that the music he plays is not klezmer but Hasidic, and  Giora Feidman has declared that \"Klezmer is not Jewish  music.\"7 Some take issue with the term revival. Vurma  Klezmer Orkester, a young Swedish band, insist on two  revivals, not one, and see themselves as part of the  \"second renaissance\" of the music, the first one having  occurred in the late seventies.8 Others reject the term  revival. Either they argue that Jewish instrumental music  never \"died\" or they insist that what today's musicians are  doing is not revival, but something utterly contemporary.   Most would agree with Frank London, in his essay in  this issue, that \"klezmer . . . has gone from an underused  term to being overgeneralized.\" In 1981, before klezmer  music was an established category, the jacket for The  Klezmorim Metropolis carried the following instruction:  \"File under: Folk or Jazz.\"9 Since then klezmer music has  become not only an identifiable genre, but also a highly  differentiated phenomenon. It is now not possible to speak  generally of a klezmer revival, a klezmer scene, or a  Jewish music scene as if there was a single entity.  \"Klezmer\" or \"klez\" (it is not even necessary to specify  \"music\") circulates within a vast musical landscape. Part  of the success of the music in today's popular music  market stems from the strategic placement of the music.  As Joel Lewis notes in his review of a Klezmatics concert  in 1995, they play \"the Ashkenazic Jewish folk music  known as klezmer\" but \"have a broad enough appeal to fit  equally into the programs of folk, jazz and world music  festivals.\"10 They aren't \"trapped inside a musical  'shtetl.'\"11  Not only is klezmer one of several kinds of Jewish  music on a Sunday morning music show that features  \"Israeli/Jewish/Klezmer/Yiddish\" music,12 Klezmer has  also become a kind of \"world music.\" The Klezmatics  describes itself as \"the planet's radical Jewish roots band,\"  Klezmos plays \"World Klez music,\" and Rubinchik's  Orkestyr features \"Old-World Beat\" (a pun on Old World  and world beat).13 The music of Brave Old World has  been described as \"world-Jewish.\" Ben Brussell identifies  the format of Klezmania! (San Francisco) as \"definitive  world music.\" In order to tell the many klezmer bands  apart, musicians and critics identify ever more eclectic  and specific musical alignments and orientations. The  Cayuga Klezmer Revival band characterizes its style  variously as \"folk/roots/electric/acoustic/\" and \"jazz, rock,  swing, folk ska, and reggae\" and identifies its repertoire as  \"a mixture of traditional Eastern-European tunes, Ladino,  Israeli, and original tunes.\"14 The British group Souls of  Fire performs \"klezmer-roots-worldbeat-dance.\" HaLaila  calls its music \"tribal Jewish funk, or depending on our  mood, 'acid klez.'\"   Objections to the term notwithstanding, \"revival\"  speaks to a rupture of cultural transmission in postwar  America. During the early fifties, while playing in Las  Vegas, Mickey Katz was approached by a Texan who  asked him to play some \"Jew music\": \"I haven't heard me  a good frailach since my bar mitzvah down in Waco,\" the  Texan explained. Katz complied and \"played him some  Jewish jazz.\"15 By the seventies, the \"Texan Hebrew\"  would have been able to hear those freylekhs again and  then some. During the intervening years, however, many  stellar performers of the music he remembers from his bar  mitzvah party were no longer active or had passed away.  Nor had the music been enshrined as heritage in the way  that many other musics were.16 Indeed, performers like  Henry Sapoznik came to the Jewish instrumental tradition  through other heritage musics, in his case Appalachian,  while others started from Balkan heritage music. As  Robert Cantwell has argued, \"many kinds of music that at  other periods had been commercially performed and  recorded, such as blues, old-time, and bluegrass music-- music of chiefly southern or southeastern rural origin-- came to be regarded as folk music and enjoyed a revival  on that basis, to be followed in the next decade by Irish  ceili, Klezmer, and other ethnic musics.\"17 It was only a  matter of time, in Hankus Netsky's view, before Jewish  instrumental music would reemerge: \"Archaic things  come back. . . . The blues came back. . . . And the same  thing eventually happened when our generation came of  age and said, 'Wait a minute. What happened? Where's  our folk music?'\"18  Sapoznik's now legendary account of his career is a  vivid case in point. While the Texan Jew would fondly  remember the \"Jew music\" of his bar mitzvah in the  thirties, Sapoznik remembers hating the music at his bar  mitzvah in the sixties:  My parents had hired one of the top New York City  klezmer clarinetists to play at the reception. So there he  was on the bandstand blowing some of the best bulgars in  the business and all I wanted to do was to crawl into the  nearest, deepest hole.  \"Can't this guy play anything modern?\" the bar  mitzvah kvetshed. At that point all my life had been spent  in the presence of this music. I made no distinction  between the hasidic nigunim we sang on the schoolbus  going to Lubavitch yeshiva or the klezmer and Yiddish  music ubiquitously heard at the Catskill hotels where we  sang during Passover. I thought everybody had a cantor  father who wandered around the house softly humming  the High Holidays liturgy to himself.19  Sapoznik's parents had paid for klezmer, but he  wanted rock'n'roll. His sense of rupture pointed not to the  music but to interest in it: \"The music was patiently  waiting for us to hear it again.\" Meanwhile, Sapoznik  played rock'n'roll, made his way through the folk song  revival (Woody Guthrie, Cisco Houston, Bob Dylan), and  \"soon found myself getting into more traditional kinds of  music: Irish, New England Contradances, but mainly  Appalachian string band music.\" In the mid-seventies,  Sapoznik was visiting Tommy Jarrell, a senior Southern  string musician, when Jarrell, observing that many Jews  were interested in old-time music, asked Sapoznik:  \"Hank, don't your people got none of your own music?\"  Sapoznik was stunned. He headed back to New York,  consulted with his grandfather, who was the same age as  Jarrell, and began the search for his \"own music.\"20  I use the term \"heritage music\" to distinguish  between music that is part and parcel of a way of life and  music that has been singled out for preservation,  protection, enshrinement, and revival--in a word, heritage  music. Heritage music, as it emerges from Hentoff's  account of hearing The Klezmorim for the first time,  verges on necromancy--literally a conjuring up of the  dead. \"Heritage,\" as I have argued elsewhere, is a mode of  cultural production that gives the disappearing and gone a  second life as an exhibit of itself.21 In 1977, Hentoff  wrote of a new generation of musicians revivifying-- literally, giving new life to--a nearly extinct musical  \"heritage.\" At the same time, he distanced himself from  \"heritage\" when he conceded that although Liberman was  \"director of music and arts at the Judah Magnes Museum  in Berkeley, California . . . he and his colleagues do not  play as if they are in a museum.\"22   It is significant, however, that two pioneering  klezmer figures, Liberman and Sapoznik, found support  for their early efforts in the context of Jewish arts  institutions--Sapoznik was project director of the Jewish  music research project at the Martin Steinberg Center for  Jewish Arts of the American Jewish Congress from 1977  to 1979, thanks to government support in the form of  SETA grants. This is the period during which folk arts  became recognized as a division or funding category or  priority within government agencies such as the National  Endowment for the Arts (1974), the New York State  Council for the Arts (1980), and the American Folklife  Center at the Library of Congress (1976). The  Smithsonian Institution, which had established the  American Folklife Festival in 1967, featured Jews at their  bicentennial festival in 1976.23 Situated in these agencies  and in state arts councils, professionally trained folklorists  and ethnomusicologists curated, evaluated, and otherwise  guided increasingly sophisticated heritage programs in the  public sector. The Klezmer Conservatory Band was  incubated at the New England Conservatory of Music in  Boston, where Hankus Netsky taught and eventually  chaired the Jazz Studies department.  Almost twenty years later, Seth Rogovoy, who is  writing a book on the klezmer revival, would praise the  \"downtown jazz artists who don't approach it [klezmer  music] as a fossilized object of ethnomusicological  interest but as a living form worthy of updating and  experimentation.\"24 The formulation \"living form\" is less  an affirmation of continuity than a statement of aesthetic  orientation. It suggests a musical point of departure rather  than an historical destination.   The klezmer revival accommodates not only  historical and aesthetic orientations, but also religious  ones. Describing a recent concert by the David Krakauer  Trio, Rogovoy writes that \"A standing-room-only crowd  jammed the pews and aisles of St. James Church on  Tuesday night to worship at the altar of klezmer.\"25 As a  metaphor for the enthusiasm of fans, \"worship at the altar  of klezmer\" suggests that listening to the music is (or is  like) a religious experience. Such metaphors are  reminders that the term revival has historically been  associated with religious revivals.26 Revivalist carries the  sense of renewed attention and new presentation (an  orientation to the past), while revitalist--Hasidism has  been characterized as a revitalist movement--suggests new  life or vigor (a program for the future).27 The distinction  between revivalist and revitalist tends to blur, and the  terms are sometimes used interchangeably with each  other, and with renewal. Both are often associated with  youth and countercultures, as is klezmer. While it would  be going too far to call them youth movements, Hasidism,  and for that matter the Haskala, attracted youthful  followers during the early period of their formation.  Both professional and amateur bands often  characterize the spirit of their performances in terms of a  religious experience--not the sedate murmurings of polite  synagogues but something more akin to ecstatic  possession or altered states of consciousness. The  Klezmatic's most recent album is titled Possession.28  Appropriately enough, tracks 9 through 17 are from the  score created by the Klezmatics for Tony Kushner's  adaptation of Sh. An-ski's A Dybbuk, a play about the  transmigration of a soul--Kushner himself, in the liner  notes, characterizes the music as \"so full of August  Mystery.\"29 Musicians and those who write about them  speak of madness, wildness, frenzy, hysteria, and passion.  Call it the youthful enthusiasm of devoted aficionados.  Here again there are religious connotations: the etymology  of enthusiasm is inspiration and the primary meaning of  inspiration is \"a divine influence or manifestation that  qualifies a person to receive and communicate sacred  revelation.\"30 Divine inspiration is a redundancy.   Some bands have adopted names (and record titles)  that invoke a generally spiritual or religious sensibility or  refer more specifically to Judaism or Hasidism and its  musical repertoire, to mention only Frank London's  Hasidic New Wave project, Farbrangen Fiddlers, Souls of  Fire, Thread of Blue, and Burnt Offering. Some of these  bands are associated with synagogues. Others are not. In  the case of Souls of Fire, a British band, none of the  members is Jewish. Giora Feidman, who debuted his  Jewish \"soul music\" in 1972 and his records of this music  in 1973, has used album titles such as The Dance of Joy  and The Magic of Klezmer. In claiming to distill the  essence of \"Jewish soul music\" and to universalize it,  Feidman expresses a romantic mysticism reminiscent of  the fin-de-si\u000fcle Orientalism of Martin Buber and his  circle.31 Since his religious awakening, Andy Statman  insists that what is now called klezmer music was always  religiously mandated and cites its role in the fulfillment of  the mitzvah of simkhe on the occasion of a wedding. This  is the reason he gives for calling the music he plays today  Hasidic, rather than klezmer, though one critic has  characterized it as \"a sort of Jewish/new-age fusion.\"32   Arguments over what to call the phenomenon and  how to characterize the music were once dominated by the  experience of rupture and recovery. The debates have  intensified and their character has changed as the musical  formation called (or not called) klezmer expands,  diversifies, and matures.   Heritage, Tradition, Orthodoxy  To better understand the terms of these debates, the  musical practices with which they are associated, and the  historical processes of their unfolding, I will explore three  distinctions: feeling and ideology (Raymond Williams),  tradition and ideology (Haim Soloveichik), and tradition  and heritage. \"Tradition,\" the opening number of Fiddler  on the Roof, performs the distinction between tradition  and heritage simply by making such a fuss over what is  otherwise taken for granted. \"Tradition\" can no longer be  assumed because it is under attack. When all is said and  done Fiddler on the Roof is a performance of heritage, not  tradition, because the Broadway musical offers the  disappearing and gone a second life as an exhibition of  itself. Heritage is coded at every level--diegesis (the  narrative), mimesis (the representation), and the  performance artifact itself.  Fiddler on the Roof is also a long way from  contemporary orthodoxy, which Soloveitchik  distinguishes from tradition. Though he focuses on the  transformation of contemporary orthodoxy, his distinction  between tradition and orthodoxy is relevant to a  consideration of the klezmer phenomenon. \"A traditional  society has been transformed into an orthodox one\" when  what was a matter of course (what was once absorbed and  habitual) has become subject to rules, formal teaching,  and scrupulous attention to textual authority.33 The result  is not \"heritage,\" but a tendency toward stringency  (humra).34 As a result, \"performance is no longer, as in a  traditional society, replication of what one has seen, but  implementation of what one knows.\"35 This trend started  in the mid-fifties \"and by the mid-seventies was well on  its way to being, if it had not already become, the  dominant mode of religiosity.\"36 The result is what he  calls \"a performative spirituality, not unlike that of the  arts, with all its unabating tension.\"37  Soloveitchik uses an explicitly musical metaphor,  \"For spiritual life is an attempt, as a great pianist once put  it, to play music that is better than it can be played.\"38  Applied to klezmer music, the humra principle is most  clearly expressed by Austrian-based Budowitz, an  \"ensemble of Klezmer veterans performing early Jewish  repertoire and style on historical instruments.\"39 Taking  their cue from the early music movement, they perform  music that critics have described as \"Very pure. The kind  of music that enthralled Bartok and Kodaly.\"40  The shift that Soloveitchik describes--\"the aspiration  will be . . . more to purity of ideology than of impulse--is  precisely the distinction that Williams makes between  ideology and feeling.41 Gone is the yidishkayt that was  \"something deep in the bone,\" a Judaism whose essence  \"lay not in law or ritual, but in a social vision (yoysher)  and a moral standard of conduct (mentshlikhkeyt).\"42 He  attributes the end of \"self-evident Jewishness\" to a  \"rupture in the traditional religious sensibilities\" once  rooted in what he calls the mimetic society.43   Stringent orthodoxy is not the only response to the  end of \"self-evident\" Jewishness, though it could be said  that what counts as self-evident Jewishness has come to  an end more than once. What I have been calling heritage- -and klezmer music is in many ways a case in point--is a  second outcome. Historians of European popular culture  such as Peter Burke and E. P. Thompson have argued that  pressures on \"customary consciousness and customary  usages\" prompt the emergence of \"folklore\" at emerging  divides between high and low culture, as the upper ranks  collect \"folklore\" from the lower ranks.44 When the  Haskala applied pressure on customary consciousness and  practices, Jewish folklore emerged from the outtakes of  reform.45 What had been rejected as tradition would  eventually be embraced as heritage.   An ideological relationship to tradition among  haredim as well as among the new klezmers arises from a  ruptured past that \"gave them free reign to create a  familiar past of which the present was simply an  extension.\"46 On their first album, East Side Wedding  (1977), The Klezmorim explained that \"To rediscover the  unashamed passion and hysteria of authentic Jewish  music, you have to journey to the limits of living  memory,\" which they identified with the period of mass  immigration and \"neglected manuscripts and forgotten 78  rpm recordings.\"47 On their 1981 album, The Klezmorim  Metropolis, they declared, \"We are The Klezmorim. We  play klezmer music. It's been underground for fifty years.  Now it's back.\"48 Frank London has noted that The  Klezmorim \"never once mentioned Jews or being Jews. It  was just klezmer, klezmer, klezmer\" and added in a later  interview, \"For years, many of the klezmer bands hid  behind the word 'klezmer' as a way of avoiding the  'Jewish' word.\"49 This is an astute observation.   The word Jewish does appear on The Klezmorim's  first album, but strictly in an historical context. The  \"Jewishness\" of their project is carried instead by the  word Yiddish and the prominence of Yiddish terms, song  titles, and lyrics. They are klezmers by affinity, rather  than by descent or Jewish identification. Where bloodlines  are absent--Hankus Netsky, Judy Bressler, Henry  Sapoznik, and Giora Feidman identify with Jewish  instrumentalists and Yiddish performers in their families-- affinities are invoked. Like their historical models, The  Klezmorim explain, they started out playing in small  bands, they improvise, they arrange their numbers  communally and by ear, and they take pride in never  playing a solo the same way twice.  In the absence of living models, particular  importance is accorded texts (and in the case of klezmer  music, records). Defining the relationship of  contemporary performance to past models as best they can  be reconstructed is an ongoing concern. As London  commented, \"Whenever we think we are being very now,  very new, we find out what we have done is actually very  traditional.\"50 The sense of newness in the old and  oldness in the new is also conveyed in a band name like  Brave Old World and characterizations like \"Making old- world music new.\"51 Kapelye's first album was entitled  Future and Past and carried the following dedication:  \"This album is dedicated to our families who have taught  us that our future is our Jewish past.\"52  Anachronism is a productive principle, a musical  aesthetic, which operates by unsettling temporal direction.  There is no smooth continuity from yesterday's klezmorim  to today's klezmers. There is no dramatic rupture, no  simple sequence of life, death, and rebirth, as the term  revival would imply. Instead, old and new are in a  perpetually equivocal relationship. The future precedes  the past, the new precedes the old, the revival precedes its  historical models. While klezmer revival suggests the  primacy of recovery, initially a copying of what can still  be heard on old records and from elderly musicians, \"it is  the copying that originates,\" as Clifford Geertz has so  aptly stated, even in the case of meticulous musical  reconstructions.53   Klezmer musicians have felt a need to root present  practice in a meaningful past, which is not the same as  searching for roots, though for many the two come  together. Even the term \"roots music\" conveys a sense of  rootedness, rather than an exclusive claim to a singular  origin. However much klezmer music offered clarinetist  David Krakauer a \"musical home,\" it was its fusion with  jazz that gave his compositions what one reviewer  characterized as \"a thoroughly contemporary sensibility,\"  no doubt because that fusion did not produce melting-pot  music or a soft universalism or easy affirmation of a  singular ethnic identity.54 A sense of rootedness does not  require musical monogamy.   While orthodoxy and heritage do not by any means  exhaust the possible outcomes of rupture, they do force us  to rethink any easy opposition between conservative and  radical, tradition and innovation, custom and ideology. As  Thompson notes for his period, the eighteenth and  nineteenth centuries, \"So far from having the steady  permanence suggested by the word 'tradition', custom was  a field of change and contest, an arena in which opposing  interests made conflicting claims . . . it is an arena of  conflictual elements, which requires some compelling  pressure--as, for example, nationalism or prevalent  religious orthodoxy or class consciousness--to take form  as 'system'.\"55 Not only religious orthodoxy but also the  klezmer revival have taken form as system. Indeed, the  klezmer revival is an example of what Neil Rosenberg, in  his taxonomy of music revivals, calls a named-system  revival--others include Balkan, old-time fiddling, blues,  and bluegrass.56 System in this context signals the shift  from tradition to ideology.  What can be learned in this regard from the fate of  East European Jewish instrumental music among Hasidim  and haredim in America and Israel? While an earlier  American generation considered even kosher versions of  swing and jazz \"alien to a 'Jewish rejoicing' (yidishe  simche),\" their children and grandchildren were open to  rock beat and to kosher rock, that is, to rock with  acceptable lyrics, a shift that Soloveitchik attributes to the  embourgeoisement of American-born haredim.57 Hoping  to find klezmer music still going strong and without  interruption among those who seem to hew to tradition  most vigorously, Joel Rubin turned to haredim in Israel,  the subject of his essay in this issue. He offers several  reasons for why he did not find what he expected,  including the low status of professional musicians in  haredi society and the rabbinical ban in the 1860s on  instrumental music in Eretz Israel. In other words, Rubin  found himself exploring music within a religious  community, not a music scene. This is not to say that a  religious music scene does not exist, whether here or in  Israel, but only that klezmer music as such is not its  focus.58 According to Rubin, Hasidic and haredi  communities in Israel are not part of the new klezmer  scene, though there is some musical traffic and Rubin  himself is something of a bridge between the two worlds.  Those worlds are separated by more than music.    Catalytic Ruptures  A delay in the heritage process prior to the klezmer  revival not only left Jewish party music to the vicissitudes  of sensibility, but also spared it from the very ideological  attachments, from the political and religious engagements,  that gave other forms of Jewish music and musical  practices a competitive advantage at the time. The music  of American Jewish wedding musicians faded from view  for some of the very reasons that would make it attractive  to the generation that later picked it up. No movement,  whether political or religious, had claimed this kind of  music. Israeli music was sustained by the Zionist  movement, the labor movement had its songs, mandolin  orchestras, and choral groups, and both had their youth  groups and summer camps. The synagogues had their  cantors, choirs, and schools. In contrast, professional  instrumentalists worked for a market, not a movement.  Though movements also constitute a market of sorts,  movements give precedence to ideological considerations.  To better understand why the lapse was catalytic, it is  useful to compare the turning to \"klezmer\" music during  the seventies, described by Frank London and Alicia  Svigals in their contributions to this issue, with the turning  from the \"old but little-known happy Jewish music of the  old country\" that Mickey Katz was still playing in the  fifties.59 The two moments are deeply implicated in one  another, both musically (Katz's material has made a kind  of comeback) and in terms of structures of feeling (his  stigmatized irreverence is a badge of honor for a  subsequent generation). As Don Byron explained, he was  attracted to \"the mischief in [klezmer] music\" and found  in Mickey Katz, a master of mischief: \"I tend to gravitate  to whoever is playing the trickiest, outest stuff, and that's  where I live,\" whether the music be \"klezmer, jazz, big  band, or improvisation.\"60   That the music was not previously picked up cleared  the path for receiving it in purely aesthetic terms. This is  how many musicians first became interested in it--London  is emphatic on this point. So is John Zorn. A saxophonist  and composer, Zorn curated the Radical New Jewish  Culture Festival at the Knitting Factory in New York City  in 1993, and has issued klezmer/jazz/funk fusions on his  Tzadik label. For Zorn, \"All music is on equal grounds  and there's no high art and low art.\" His compositional  approach has been described as jumping \"from style to  style the way a television picture does when a deranged  channel surfer has the remote control.\"61 The \"roots\" of  this radicalism are more likely to lie in avant-garde  aesthetics and Jewish political activism than in religious  orthodoxy or folkloric heritage, though there are  exceptions like Andy Statman.  It could be said that Statman is reconfiguring the  relationships between tradition, heritage, and orthodoxy in  his live connection to Hasidic nigunim, spiritual take on  jazz, and religious orientation to performance. Statman's  newest CD, Between Heaven & Earth: Music of the  Jewish Mystics, reclaims \"klezmer as sacred music\" and  produces \"a sort of Jewish/new-age fusion,\" according to  Rogovoy.62 As I noted earlier, Statman insists that this  music was always religiously mandated and insists that it  is Hasidic, not klezmer music. Though he calls his band  The Andy Statman Klezmer Orchestra, Statman has said,  \"I don't like to use the word 'klezmer.' It becomes very  limiting,\" a statement that hints at shifts in aesthetic and  not only religious sensibility.63   The very name of his ensemble aligns it with such  early bands as the Abe Schwartz Orchestra, Harry  Kandel's Orchestra, Art Shryer's Modern Jewish  Orchestra, rather than with the revival bands. Revivalists  are more likely to invoke other musics (Yid Vicious, The  Freilachmakers Old-Time String Band, Mazeltones,  Jumpin' Jazzy Jewish Music). Revivalists tend to display a  playful, even nostalgic, relationship to the tradition (Di  Ganeyvim, Shir Fun, Kudzu Klezmer, Take the Oy Train).  They are likely to identify with the immigrant history of  the music and musicians (Greena Kozinas, Hester Street  Troupe, and Ellis Island). And, most of all, they proudly  identify themselves and their music as klezmer, a term  that earlier generations of musicians considered an insult.  Whatever its status might have been when it was a  functioning part of East European Jewish life, as outsider  music (The Klezmorim called it \"underground music\"),  the instrumental tradition was vulnerable to a rupture in  transmission. That rupture has given shape and direction  to the new klezmer music and its various sensibilities and  ideologies. That the music was once stigmatized is an  asset for a generation committed to new forms of  radicalism like the Queer Yiddishist movement identified  by Svigals. For prominent Jewish klezmer performers like  the Klezmatics and their Jewish audiences, klezmer music  gives voice to what they call the Radical Jewish Culture  movement.   Klezmer music has become the sound of particular  forms of identification, as can be seen in Svigals's  \"Manifesto.\" Whether defined positively (queer  Yiddishism, socialist Jewish past, serious approach to the  music) or negatively (no nostalgia, no \"tourism of the  past,\" no cuteness, no apologetics, no fetishizing of  authenticity), \"the identity music of Jewish American  youth\" envisioned by Svigals articulates distinctive  sensibilities and their sounds. While the scene (actually  several interlocking scenes) has many of the features  associated with youth subcultures, as Svigals shows, it is  also intergenerational, a feature that London specially  values.  London, who is now drawn to \"the secular, social  activist Yiddish song tradition,\" did not start out that way.  Quite the opposite. Klezmer music initially captured his  interest because it is \"good, just on its own terms.\" It is  one of many kinds of music he plays. When he says of his  first experience with the music that \"It really started in the  middle of nowhere,\" he is describing what it is like to  engage with music that is literally separated from its  source.64 Recordings make it possible to circulate the  sounds of music without circulating the musicians. This  disjunction not only heightens the experience of  \"nowhere\" that London describes, but also his sense that  \"one can study and assimilate the elements of any musical  style, form, or tradition by ear,\" a legacy of the historical  avant-garde.65 This aesthetic practice is intensified by the  situation of music without memory--or, in some cases, in  spite of memory.  If London could play any kind of music then anyone  could play Jewish music--and they did, though doing so  was not so straightforward. As Don Byron explained,  \"I've played klezmer music since 1980. But it hasn't been  easy to feel entitled to play it. A white man plays world  music, and no one questions the ethnic connection. But  not too many brothers are playing music from Bulgaria. I  spent hundreds of hours transcribing Katz's records: I feel  entitled to the knowledge, entitled to participate. But what  amazes people is that I'm a black guy doing the music of  people who are supposed to be white.\"66  London says he played this music despite, not  because, of the fact that he is Jewish. Being Jewish was  actually an obstacle because his experience of growing up  with Jewish music had left him feeling that it was corny.  When he embraced klezmer music, London was also  refusing \"all the shlock, all the shmaltz, all the things  about Jewish music that never interested me, all the Israeli  music, all the Yiddish theater music, about all that  sentimentality.\" Not roots and heritage, but technical  challenge, fun, and the market drove his initial interest in  the music, much as it did his captivation with jazz.  It is precisely this disjunction--music coming out of  nowhere--that allowed London to engage klezmer music  at all. Not only had the music been detached from its  historical moorings, but his generation could come  towards it with a detached attitude, an attitude they had  willed and cultivated. \"Nowhere\" is a space of abstraction  where sounds unmoored from other times and places can  be engaged as sound for its own sake. In that place called  nowhere, musicians can play anything. They do so in the  \"theme concerts\" London describes. Jewish was a theme.  It was resolutely not an \"identity\" or \"heritage.\"   Jewish, he soon discovered, was also a \"scene\" and it  is this scene that London and Svigals speak to in their  accounts from the inside, as musicians who have been part  of it, each in their own way, for almost two decades. It is  telling that London speaks in the spatial terms of nowhere  (and scene), not in the temporal terms of revival and  heritage. David Krakauer also uses a spatial metaphor  when he says of klezmer music that \"I felt in a certain way  that I had found a kind of musical home,\" though it is not  the only place he lives.67  While he attributes the secret of the Klezmatics'  success to their being \"a great rock band--that is, they  swing hard and get people emotionally,\" Michael Dorf,  who owns the Knitting Factory, adds that \"there is  something in their music that reaches the Jewish part of  me.\"68 This statement marks the distance traveled from  the sixties, when Milton Gordon in his study of  assimilation in American life could still warn his readers  that \"the individual who engages in frequent and sustained  primary contacts across ethnic group lines, particularly  racial and religious, runs the risk of becoming what, in  sociological parlance, has been called the 'marginal  man'.\"69 Gordon's marginal man, derived from Chicago  sociologists working in the twenties and thirties (Robert  E. Park and Everett V. Stonequist), was a \"social deviant\"  on the verge of nervous breakdown. Nothing could be  further from the sensibilities informing the klezmer music  scene.   The Jewish part of Dorf is clearly not all of him. The  other part, to which he attributes the Klezmatics' success,  has helped the music travel far beyond the wedding circuit  to which Jewish instrumental music had become confined.  During the first half of this century, the music could be  heard not only at simkhes, but also at banquets and social  and political functions of various kinds, Jewish caf\u000es and  restaurants.70 By the fifties, it was most likely to be heard  at weddings and in the English-Yiddish comedy shows by  performers like Mickey Katz.   Multiple Temporalities  Emphasizing a continuity they have worked hard to  achieve in the wake of genocide and cultural  obsolescence, pioneers of the klezmer revival repeatedly  delineate the chronology of the music they have  recuperated, a process that plays memory against history  and autobiography against musical reconstruction. While  the scene has a relatively short history, less than three  decades, telling that history is integral to it. The founding  figures not only tunneled to the past through archives, but  also sought out living bridges to the music as it was once  played. They apprenticed themselves to the last exponents  of the tradition. Their acts of recuperation, preservation,  documentation, and renewal affirmed Isaac Bashevis  Singer's apothegm, \"There's a big difference between  'dead' and 'dying',\" the motto of the Boston radio program  The Yiddish Voice (WUNR, Brookline,  Massachusetts).71   The founders of the scene have a keen sense of the  peculiar temporality of the revival. Unlike subsequent  generations, which have grown up with neo-klezmer  music, the founding cohort lived through the rupture and  the recovery, an experience that heightened their historical  awareness. Short and fast, the history of the scene is  remembered in detail by those directly involved in it.  Long and slow, the history of the music that inspires it has  left spotty evidence. Those who have made the scene have  also had to excavate the music. Their sense of one is  infused with their sense of the other. While a history of  klezmer music like the one provided by Hankus Netsky is  narrated forward, from the \"beginning\" to the present, it is  understood backwards, from now to then. Younger  musicians are forming their own sense of the music's  temporality, as can be seen from the claim by Vurma,  which models itself on \"the pioneer group Klezmorim,\"  that they are part of the second renaissance of klezmer. In  an interview about ten years ago, about the time they  disbanded, Kevin Linscott of The Klezmorim discouraged  new groups from using his band's music as a model and  encouraged them to go back to historical recordings.72  \"Klezmer music,\" as it emerges from what is said and  written and from the musical practices themselves, is an  \"initial shaping concept.\"73 It bears, as Williams puts it,  the marks of its formation and its unresolved problems,  both of which tend to be taken for granted. Hankus  Netsky, in his essay in this issue, starts with the European  background, immigration, and the recordings during the  first decades of this century in the United States. He  proceeds to the decline of klezmer music in the 1930s, the  parodies of the early postwar period, the sentimentality of  Jewish music of the 1960s, and the revival that began in  the 1970s (he founded the Klezmer Conservatory Band in  1980) and blossomed in the decades following.   Memory of the revival and history of the music are  not the same thing, though they tend to converge in  accounts that reflect the experience of first generation  klezmer revivalists and those who write about them. The  founding narrative is stated in the starkest terms by  Rogovoy, for whom klezmer is a phoenix rising from its  own ashes. The music is marked \"by its refusal to die\" in  the face of two assaults--the Holocaust and assimilation.  The revival is the story of what happened to \"Old World  Klezmer,\" whose \"sonorities . . . evoked the simple joys  and sorrows of shtetl life,\" in the hands of postmodern  musicians. At the same time, he documents the nuanced  sense of klezmer history expressed by Svigals, who is  quoted as saying, \"Klezmer isn't the music of an extinct  culture. . . . As contemporary living culture--as opposed  to something extinct which has been curiously and  artificially revived--Klezmer is different than it was  twenty years ago, and still more different than it was  forty, sixty, a hundred years ago.\"74 Rather than a  bifurcated temporality--before and after the revival--a  sense of differentiated historical layers is beginning to  emerge.  As professional musicians become professional  scholars, their historical vistas expand.75 Rubin looks  beyond the United States to Israel. James Loeffler, in his  contribution to this issue, looks beyond the \"golden age\"  of the interwar recordings to the early period of mass  immigration, during which the first Jewish musician's  union in the United States was established (1889). He  opens a window on the working conditions and  performance culture of professional Jewish musicians  during this era and considers their mobility. As the  musicians discussed by Loeffler entered the larger  marketplace of music, Jewish music became even more of  a niche market and some musicians, in their rising  success, left this music (and the Jewish musicians' union)  behind.   It is during the period of mass immigration that the  Yiddish theater came into its own, musicians began  making recordings, and Yiddish folk song attracted  increasing interest from scholars, artists, and publishers.  Because these developments took place in the United  States and in Europe, they did not precede immigration,  but were coincident with it. It has been argued that the  Yiddish theater and the instrumental music tradition as we  know it from early commercial recordings flowered in the  United States--performers and repertoire flowed across  the Atlantic in both directions.76 Moreover, during the  period Loeffler considers, musicians played not only for  simkhes but also on a wide variety of political,  ceremonial, and social occasions. His account offers an  important corrective to the current image of old-time  klezmer music as strictly party music.77  Loeffler's evidence suggests that specialization was a  response to a shrinking market. As they were no longer in  demand for so wide a range of events, those musicians  who continued playing for Jewish audiences came to  depend more heavily on simkhes for their living.78 They  could do so because Jewish life-cycle celebrations-- primarily the wedding, but also the bar mitzvah--had  become so much more elaborate. Those who still  remember hearing the music before the revival associate it  almost exclusively with simkhes. Many of today's  klezmers and critics project this image of the music back  to the middle ages. Rogovoy, for example, states that  \"Strictly defined, Klezmer is the Jewish instrumental  music that was played by professional musicians in  Eastern Europe for occasions such as weddings and bar  mitzvahs--a tradition that dates back at least as far as the  Middle Ages.\"79 As for weddings, the musical  requirements were far more extensive than dance music  and still are in Hasidic communities today. During the  nineteenth century (and earlier), wedding festivities could  extend over a three-week period and require musicians  and a varied repertoire for a series of events. As for bar  mitzvahs, in Eastern Europe they were generally low-key  events, not the extravagant affairs they have become  here.80  Complementing Loeffler's consideration of the  working conditions of Jewish instrumentalists in the  United States, Robert Rothstein, in his essay in this issue,  attends to the occupational subculture of professional  Jewish instrumentalists in Eastern Europe as revealed  through their argot. He presents a little klezmer-talk from  Sholem Aleichem's novel Stempenyu. In Joachim  Neugroschel's 1979 English translation, the klezmorim  sound like a couple of jazz hipsters rapping about chicks.  The translator has substituted one musical argot (jazz) for  another (klezmer), with the assumption that his readers in  1979 would recognize the lingo. Would the translation  need to be updated for subsequent generations by  substituting rap for jazz? If yes, something would be lost,  for American exponents of the klezmer tradition not only  played jazz. Many also referred to their bulgars, doinas,  and freylakhs as Jewish jazz and many played both Jewish  dance music and jazz on the same program.   Neugroschel's translation thus captures a musical  convergence subsequent to the period represented in the  novel, but meaningful to the later history of the music and  to later readers. Many musicians have come to neo- klezmer music with formal training in classical music and  jazz, and use what they know to create such new musical  fusions as freestyle klezmer. Objections to the term  Jewish jazz notwithstanding (Sapoznik quips that if  klezmer is Jewish jazz, then jazz must be goyish klezmer),  the relationship between the two musics suggests a history  of reversals as much as revivals, with musicians moving  from klezmer to jazz and back, while keeping both in play  and creating new fusions.81   Future translations of Stempenyu may have to reckon  with a new klezmer-loshn, the argot of the revival.  Variations on the word klezmer (klez, neo-klezmer,  klezmology, and klezmeroid) pepper discussions of the  music. Band names play with even more possibilities:  Klezmania!, Klezmatics, Klezical, Klezmechaye!,  Klezmos, Klezmotones, Kleztet, KlezKanada,  Klezmeydlekh. KlezKamp is the affectionate name of the  Yiddish Folk Arts Institute established by Henry Sapoznik  in 1984. The cyberhome of klezmer information is Ari  Davidow's KlezShack. This terminology has no parallel in  Yiddish, as evidenced by entry 285 (muziker [musician])  in Nahum Stutchkoff's monumental Thesaurus of the  Yiddish Language (1950) and the 1913  \"'Klesmer'sprache\" lexicons of S. Weissenberg and Alfred  Landau.82  There is no klezmer-loshn in Di vunderlikhe  geshikhte fun r' shmelkele der klezmer, a little chapbook  published in Warsaw in 1910) about eyn yidisher klezmer  in the Prague ghetto in 1820. Reb Shmelkele, a famous  artist on the fiddle and paragon of piety, played so well  that \"men hot gekent antshlofn vern fin siskayt\" (one  could fall asleep from sweetness). He was invited to play  for the hoi polloi. Christian nobility treated him with great  honor and even sent their carriages for him. At night, in  the privacy of his home, he would play \"Al Naharot  Bavel\" (By the Waters of Babylon) with such  moralishkayt that he could rouse feeling in a stone. He  was also handsome and humble. Not surprisingly, the tone  of the chapbook is pious, not sardonic.   Note that the anonymous author specifies \"Jewish\"  klezmer, but at no point does he refer to \"klezmer\" music.  Nor does he play with ethnographic detail--there is no  musician's argot--though he does endow Reb Shmelkele's  performance with extraordinary, even divinely inspired,  power. We do not find Reb Shmelkele playing at Jewish  weddings, but at elegant balls and aristocratic mansions,  the king's court and robber's den. These locales belong  more to the world of the wonder tale than to the daily  reality of Jewish instrumentalists, though klezmorim did  perform for the nobility. While this story cannot be taken  as a baseline for the history of klezmer music, it does  reveal an historically specific musical sensibility that  values emotive effect.83 This sensibility is allied with the  sentimentality of melodrama, a popular genre of Yiddish  theater in the period and even today in the Purim plays  produced by Hasidic communities in New York.84  Klezmer music--the term, the category, the music,  the sensibility--are not only contemporary, but new.  Jewish instrumentalists before the revival characterized  their music in a variety of ways, but klezmer music was  not one of them, a point that Statman underscores when  he says his band plays Hasidic, not klezmer, music.  However, Statman had to pass through the klezmer revival  to get to Hasidic music and once he got there he has been  moving in new directions that are difficult to name.    Incipient Heritage  Albums produced in the fifties, sixties, and early seventies  not only feature the performances of active wedding  musicians, but also reveal an incipient heritage orientation  to the instrumental tradition. Wedding Dances, featuring  clarinetist Marty Levitt and his orchestra, promises  listeners \"authentic WEDDING DANCES\" and assures  them that the music on this album will be as good \"as  when he performs in person at a traditional wedding\"-- hopefully listeners would hire him and his orchestra for  their simkhes.85 Rudy Tepel's 1962 album, Chasidic  Wedding: Rudy Tepel and His Orchestra Play Dance  Melodies of Vizhnitz, Lubavich, Modzitz, Satmar,  Skulen, Mea Shearim also features the performances of an  active musician.86 Tepel claimed a repertory of over six  hundred Hasidic melodies and estimated that he had  played close to five thousand weddings in a twenty-year  period.   The liner notes, however, also suggest an emerging  preservationist sensibility. They were prepared not by  Tepel, but by the producers of the album, the husband and  wife team B.-H. Stambler, who \"have been active for the  past fifteen years [i.e., since 1947] in gathering,  preserving and creating Jewish music. They have  pioneered in recording Hasidic and Sephardic music, and  in the restoration of historic cantorial discs.\" Accordingly,  the notes tell the listener little about the musical numbers  or the Hasidic dynasties and rebbes with whom they are  identified, but a lot about each stage of the wedding  festivities, information that insiders to the tradition would  not need. Records targeted to Hasidic communities are  more likely to focus on the history of a dynasty, its rebbe,  and his melodies, and to carry the admonition \"Please do  not play this record on the Sabbath or holidays.\"87  The note for the first number on Tepel's album,  \"Shpilt, Klezmorim!,\" uses the opportunity to offer a little  disquisition on klezmorim. After describing the sorry state  of part-time amateurs in the old country, the note  continues, \"Life in the United States has made a  tremendous change: today's klezmer is a successful, well- trained musician who devotes his full time to weddings;  these in turn have become elaborately catered affairs.\"  Rudy Tepel and his orchestra are characterized, not as  klezmorim, but as \"one of today's best-known wedding  bands.\" Consistent with this characterization, Tepel's  biographical note refers to him as a musician, not a  klezmer. Tepel expresses ambivalence in his careful  distinction between the Old World amateurs (klezmer) he  disavows and the American professionals (musicians)  with whom he identifies, the noble heritage intentions of  the Stamblers notwithstanding.  The liner notes for Rejoice: Torah in Song/Wedding  in the Old Country, a collaboration of Israeli, American,  and Canadian artists, most of them classically trained,  describe Dave Tarras as \"the greatest clarinet virtuoso of  Jewish folk music,\" a designation that already suggests a  shift of consciousness--neither Levitt nor Tepel described  what they played as folk music, though Levitt did promise  the \"authentic\" wedding dances that he plays at  \"traditional\" weddings.88 Tarras himself signaled the  shift, as Mark Slobin has noted, when he titled one of his  doinas \"Wedding on Second Avenue,\" a reference to the  Yiddish theater, which often included wedding scenes.89  The wedding and its music were literally staged for the  album.   A heritage orientation is even more explicit on Adele  Margolin's album Pages of History, which featured  \"Living Torah\" on one side and \"A Wedding in the Old  Tradition\" on the other.90 Margolin, a mezzo-soprano and  product of the Yiddish Folk Schools and Jewish Teachers  Seminary, hosted a Jewish music program on WLIB and  WEVD. The arrangement on Pages of History, played by  the Hebrew Folk Ensemble, was intended to make the  music \"sound like the 'Kappelia' (Miniature orchestra)  which was the major part of the entertainment at these  small town weddings. His [Amitai Ne'man,  arranger/conductor] successful handling of the subject met  with the approval of Folklorists who have been fortunate  to hear a true Kappelia in the old country.\" We see here  the hallmarks of \"heritage music.\" The music is not only  performed but also exhibited, glossed, translated, and  authenticated by \"folklorists.\"   These recordings circulated in Jewish circles. So did  reissues of great cantorial performances and artistic  reworkings of Yiddish folk songs by cantors, luminaries  of the Yiddish stage, and concert artists such as Jan  Peerce, Herschel Bernardi, Sidor Belarsky and Masha  Benya, Seymour Rechzeit and Miriam Kressyn. Their  approach grows out of earlier efforts in Europe, Palestine,  and the United States to create art music based on Jewish  sources. Lazar Weiner was a living link to the East  European concertizing tradition. Born in Kiev in 1897,  Weiner came to New York when he was seventeen.91 His  settings of Yiddish folk song, whether he arranged them  for chorus or accompanied them on piano, elevated these  songs to the level of classical music. His approach was  consistent with the efforts of Jewish composers in St.  Petersburg at the turn of the century to use Yiddish folk  song as the basis for creating a Jewish national music.   Simple Noise  Sensitivity to musical hierarchy also informs the  instrumental tradition, not only historically, as Loeffler  shows in his discussion of the stigma associated with the  term klezmer, but also within certain sectors of the  klezmer revival today. According to the liner notes for his  1977 album, Giora Feidman \"took an ancient art of the  Klezmer, an unschooled, Eastern European Jewish  musician, from the folklore plateau of amateurism and  elevated it to artistic heights, amazingly sophisticated,  profound in style and virtuosic eclat.\"92 This is a long  way from the avant-gardism of a John Zorn, who  considers all music equal--\"there's no high art and low  art.\" And, for that matter, from the ethos of the folk song  revival, which turned the hierarchy upside-down, but did  not get rid of it.  Inclusive as the folk song revival was, it could not  find a place for the Jewish instrumental tradition. Why  not? Clues may be found in debates over the definition of  folk song, the aesthetic of simple noise, and the  celebration of amateurism. Above all, for the revivalists,  folk song did not require elevation. On the contrary,  adorned performance was a statement in its own right, a  critique of the exclusive culture of classical music. There  was still a musical hierarchy, but in reverse. \"Low\" music  was good just as it was and maybe even better than \"high\"  music.   Reacting to the idea that folk song needed to be  dressed up for the concert stage, performers such as  Theodore Bikel brought an unvarnished voice, self-taught  guitar, international repertoire, and entertaining spiel to  their performance of folk song. Musical virtuosity was not  the point. Of his own abilities as a folk singer Oscar  Brand wrote in a playfully self-effacing tone, \"I even  learned to play the guitar in order to cover my vocal  deficiencies.\"93 A Canadian Jew who moved to the  United States, Brand began performing professionally  after leaving the United States Army in 1945. He can still  be heard today on WNYC 840/AM (Saturday, 7:00 p.m.),  where he hosts \"Folksong Festival with Oscar Brand.\"   In his 1962 account of the \"tidal wave of folk  singing,\" Brand defines the folk song in terms of sound,  what he calls \"simple noise,\" not provenance.94 Though  oral transmission will gradually wear away \"the unreal,  the phony, and the unnecessary,\" the patina of an antique  musical form can be fabricated instantly by those who  know how to achieve an \"artless, unself-conscious  quality\" and \"special ring of truth\" in their compositions  and performances.95 The locus classicus of \"simple  noise\" is the Anglo-American ballad. Brand is explicit on  this point: \"I can usually recognize this simplicity when I  meet it in American and Canadian song, but I find myself  less sure when I encounter the folk music of foreign lands.  I can humbly confess that most Chinese songs sound alike  to me. And the difference between a Kirghiz art song and  a Kirghiz folk song is beyond my comprehension.\"96  Several generations later, musicians such as Walter Z.  Feldman would be able not only to tell the difference, but  also to perform the music.  With its emphasis on storytelling, rather than  virtuosic musicianship, the ballad was considered a song  anyone could sing. The ethos of participation was so  strong that Professor Robert J. Potter, whom Brand  quotes, insisted that \"Folk music by its very nature doesn't  make perfectionist demands with respect to performance,  but is in some ways even 'better' if it is not perfect-- imperfection makes it more folksy.\"97 It requires \"no  more than average ability\" or even \"less than average  ability.\" Behind this overstatement of the inclusiveness of  the folk song revival is a critique of musical exclusivity:  \"Our nation is peopled with unfortunates who were tagged  as 'listeners' by harried kindergarten teachers, and,  consequently, fear the sound of their own voices raised in  song.\"98 Judging from the surge of guitar sales, the  enormous audiences at the Newport Festivals, and the  popularity of singing along, many people did ride the  wave of folk song interest.   Brand was not alone in defining folk song by effect,  an approach that separated the purists from the  popularizers. It was not long, however, before effect was  confounded with affectation and both were subjected to  parody and criticism.99 The purists objected to an  approach that was essentially theatrical, however much it  affected the effect of simple noise. Not surprisingly,  several singers, among them Bikel, were also professional  actors. To some extent Bikel approached his international  repertoire the way a character actor approaches a role.  While audiences were responsive, key figures in the  movement such as Alan Lomax took him to task: \"Alan  never seemed comfortable with me as a folk performer,  grudgingly accepting my Hebrew, Yiddish, or Russian  songs, but little else among the twenty-one languages in  which I perform, especially any Anglo-Saxon  material.\"100 Reflecting on the time when Lomax  prevented him from performing at a folklife-award  ceremony in Washington D.C., Bikel commented, \"One  more example of the folk purist fearing contamination  from 'show biz.'\"101  The international repertoire and musical sensibility of  a Theodore Bikel was more like continental cuisine than  local cooking, and it was down-home food prepared by  native cooks that the purists were after. Bikel's  performances were highly mediated by a set of aesthetic  practices specific to the revival itself. But, so too were the  performances of an Alameda Riddle or Huddie Ledbetter,  however different those practices might be.   Fault Lines of Sensibility  The decades immediately preceding the klezmer revival  are generally viewed as a wasteland. Traditional Jewish  instrumental music fell out of favor, and the folk song and  music revivals of the period showed no interest in it.  Viewed as a lull in musical interest, little remains to be  said. Viewed as a plenum of sensibility, the period holds  clues to the klezmer revival that followed. To track the  careers of Theodore Bikel, a rising professional folk  singer, and Mickey Katz, a veteran  instrumentalist/comedian, is to trace the fault lines of  changing structures of feeling.   Born in Vienna, Bikel left for Palestine with his  family in 1938 when he was fourteen years old. His  parents, ardent Zionists, were from Czernowitz, a city in  the eastern part of the Austrian-Hungarian empire before  World War I and in Romania after the war. Bikel was  born on Theodore Herzl's birthday and was named after  him. Active in a Zionist youth movement, he learned  Hebrew songs from Zionist propaganda films in Vienna  and added to his repertoire in Palestine, where he  completed school,102 lived on a kibbutz, and acted in the  Hebrew Theater. In 1946, he moved to London, where he  studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and  pursued a career in the theater. Both in London and in  Paris, which he visited frequently, he sought out folk  music and musicians in caf\u000es and bars, particularly  Russian expatriates who played gypsy music. He also  encouraged friends and acquaintances, including key  figures in the British and American folk song revivals, to  perform at parties in his home. Before long he was singing  folk songs in public. Within days of arriving in New York  in 1954 to perform in the Broadway play Tonight in  Samarkand, he attended a Pete Seeger concert at  Columbia University and introduced himself to Seeger-- the Weavers were still blacklisted at this time and their  recordings and performances were few and far between.   Bikel quickly became a part of the revival scene.  While Jewish repertoire may not have been central to the  folk song revival, Jews certainly were. They owned and  managed clubs and record companies. They were  composers, performers, agents, and managers. They were  writers and critics. Moses Asch, son of Sholem Asch,  established Folkways. Jac Holzman and Leonard Ripley  ran Elektra. Kenneth S. Goldstein issued innumerable  recordings of songs from the field. Israel Young ran the  Folklore Center on MacDougal Street. Aliza Greenblatt,  the mother of Woody Guthrie's former wife Marjorie, was  a published Yiddish poet; she wrote Der fisher, which has  become a favorite in the Yiddish song repertoire.103 Jean  Richie's husband, George Pickow, a Jew from New York,  made her an improved mountain dulcimer.104 The list  goes on.  Bikel recorded nineteen albums for Elektra, the first  of which, Folksongs of Israel, appeared in 1955. He sang  in twenty-one languages (he did not speak all of them)  and was a gifted impersonator. As he says of himself: \"I  was a character actor and considered my craft to demand  chameleon techniques.\"105 He brought a similar approach  to his international repertoire of songs and manner of  presentation, explaining that he could \"assume authentic  accents\" but was sometimes faulted for his \"willingness to  make a song accessible and palatable to an audience  unfamiliar with the material, instead of keeping the aloof  stance of a purist.\"106  The staged images on his album covers are consistent  with his theatrical approach to folk song performance. In  his recent autobiography, Bikel explained that \"Folksongs  of Israel showed an Israeli pioneer girl walking through  fields of the Jordan Valley. She was actually a New York  model, and the fields were on Long Island.\"107  Describing the cover of his first album of Yiddish songs,  he recalls that \"It shows me leaning on a guitar in front of  a Lower East Side brick wall with a theater poster on it,  listing the songs in Yiddish, and speaking to a young  yeshiva boy. The boy looked right, but was hardly likely  ever to see the inside of a yeshiva; when I called him over  to offer him a few dollars to pose with me saying, \"Come  here, yingele [kid],\" he asked, \"?Qu\u000e quiere?\" (What do  you want?) in pure Puerto Rican.\" 108 However irreverent  the in-joke, neither the image nor the music were in-your- face, in contrast with the sensibility of some neo- klezmers.   Bikel, as well as Martha Schlamme, performed  concerts at Town Hall, were featured at Newport  Festivals, and collaborated with leading revivalists such as  Pete Seeger and Oscar Brand. During the fifties, they not  only included Jewish songs on records with titles like  Folk Songs From Just About Everywhere (Bikel) and  Songs of Many Lands (Schlamme), but also issued  records devoted exclusively to what they called Jewish  folk songs. (When klezmer bands list the wide range of  what they play--the Mike Eisenstadt Band declares \"Our  speciality is anything!\"--they mean musical and  performance style and not just repertoire.)109  Schlamme, who spent her early years in Vienna, was  a classically trained soprano. She favored orchestral  accompaniment or flute and piano for her Yiddish,  Hebrew, and international songs. Shortly before her death,  she performed Yiddish songs with David Krakauer.  Though Bikel generally accompanied himself on guitar,  he also performed with orchestras and bands--Bill Lee, the  father of film maker Spike Lee, accompanied him on bass  and traveled with him on a concert tour through the South  during the sixties. If Bikel popularized a folk sound and  Schlamme concertized, Ruth Rubin was the purist. She  focused exclusively on Yiddish folk songs, which she  collected from oral tradition. Rubin performed these songs  a cappella, recorded them for Folkways, and presented her  extensive research in songbooks, published as early as  1950, and in Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish  Folk Song, which first appeared in 1963.110  These performers located the Jewishness of their  material in song and specifically in melodies and words.  Given that Yiddish folk song is a largely a cappella  tradition, what were singers headed for the stage to do?  Purists like Rubin simply performed them without  accompaniment. Not surprisingly, she was the most  attentive to the traditional vocal styles of those from  whom she collected the songs. Bikel's style owed more to  the Parisian caf\u000e and Greenwich Village coffee house,  where he learned much of his repertoire. He was more  inclined to learn songs from other professional singers and  to use instrumental accompaniment. In this way,  revivalists integrated the songs into an international  repertoire suitable for concert stage and hootenanny alike.  A constitutive feature of this approach was precisely the  recognition that the song (words and tunes) did not  emanate from the same source as the performance (vocal  style, setting, arrangement, accompaniment). The result  was not the eclectic fusions we see in the klezmer revival  or the incongruous juxtapositions of parodies of the  period, but the sounds of the revival itself.  The singers of Jewish repertoire that we remember  from this period were solo vocalists, with or without  accompaniment, not ensembles. Despite the popularity of  these performers, Yiddish folk song remained one of the  most vulnerable genres in the Jewish musical repertoire. It  had already begun the process of becoming \"heritage\"  during the late nineteenth century, if not earlier, with  efforts to collect, record, and arrange it for artistic  performance. Needless to say, few klezmer performers  today grew up speaking Yiddish, the sine qua non of the a  cappella Yiddish folk song tradition. While training in  classical music and jazz, and experience playing Balkan  and Appalachian traditional music, may have prepared  them for klezmer music, those who choose to sing must  also master enough Yiddish for the task. Interestingly,  more than one klezmer revival musician has characterized  the musical instrument, particularly the clarinet, as a  human voice, and the music itself as a language. David  Krakauer has said, \"I realized that klezmer music was the  Yiddish language in music\" and hears in it \"the sound and  inflection of my grandmother's very heavily, Yiddish- tinged English.\"111 For Alicia Svigals, klezmer is \"a  musical abstraction of the Yiddish language, and it simply  sounds 'Jewish' to our ears.\"112   Performing Obsolescence  As Benjamin Botkin has noted, \"Every revival contains  within itself the seed not only of its own destruction (in  our mass entertainment the destruction proceeds from  repetition and dullness as much as from catering to the  lowest common denominator) but also of the new  revivals.\"113 An indication that a revival (or other kind of  musical movement) has run its course is parody. The  Jewish music identified with Bikel became a prime target.  Allan Sherman's album My Son, the Folk Singer (1962)  was so funny and insightful, according to Richard  Gehman, that it was sure to \"send Theo Bikel into another  line of work.\"114 A year earlier, Bob Dylan had launched  an attack on the kind of music identified with Bikel when  he performed \"Talkin' Hava Negeilah Blues,\" which one  critic characterized as mocking \"the quintessential  American Jewish tune\"--it is the one Jewish tune that  David Krakauer can remember hearing when he was  growing up. Dylan's version was \"an epitaph for the  Hebrew folk songs sung by folk singers like Theodore  Bikel and the Weavers as a vaguely leftist, working-man's  ethnic repertoire. The mockery was prescient: The left  would not be strumming love songs about Israeli soldiers  much longer. Dylan, with his inspired instinct for the  authentic, was first to smell the phonies.\"115 So could Al  Capp, \"who introduced a new character into his widely  syndicated comic strip 'Little Abner' named 'Joanie  Phonie',\" based on Joan Baez.116  Some of the first neo-klezmers shared this sensibility.  NAMA Orchestra, based in Los Angeles, explained on  their 1978 album, Mazltov!, that what made their music  special and rare was precisely its departure from \"existing  records of Yiddish songs [which] tend to feature either  operatically trained vocalists accompanied by symphony  orchestras, or folk singers with a guitar.\"117 Unlike them,  NAMA's Pearl Rottenberg \"sings in a strong natural  voice, accompanied a small folk orchestra, such as might  have been found in the villages of Eastern Europe.\" The  term klezmer does not appear. The Jewish numbers are  part of the band's repertoire of largely Balkan folk music.  While Allan Sherman and Bob Dylan were quick to  parody the Jewish music they identified with Bikel, it  could be said that Bikel and Schlamme marked out a place  for Jewish music within an international folk music scene,  a place that would later be filled by klezmer music. So too  did the parodies. Parody is an integral part of the heritage  complex, a \"museum\" in its own right. The Jewish  parodists, not the revivalists, were the ones in the fifties  and sixties to compose new material and set  Jewish/Yiddish lyrics to popular tunes. At the same time,  they recognized that they were working with \"heritage  music.\" The cover for Mickey Katz Plays Music for  Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and Brisses shows Katz \"sitting  in a baby carriage, presumably after my own bris,  smoking a cigar.\" However, this was not a comedy album,  but strictly a recording of instrumental numbers. Recalling  the late forties and fifties when he cut the English-Yiddish  comedy records for which he is so vividly remembered,  Katz said of this album, his second for Capitol, \"Every  note of the album breathes the flavor of the old but little- known happy Jewish music of the old country, yet all the  tunes are original.118 Parody also anticipates the  irreverence and eclecticism that would become hallmarks  of the klezmer revival.   The mapping of sensibility in this period--serious  music was respectful, irreverent music was comic--was  upturned as some of the new klezmers took irreverence  seriously. They produced not the Shtetl Lite of Fiddler on  the Roof, but what has been called Heavy Shtetl or \"the  new, in-your-face Jewish music.\"119 They and their fans  relished the mischief of Don Byron's performances of  Mickey Katz's music and the Klezmer Madness of David  Krakauer. The promotional copy on The Klezmorim's  Metropolis album positively describes their models as  musicians who \"played like demons,\" stirred \"dancers to a  frenzy,\" and exhibited a style \"full of unorthodox  tonalities and \"crazily-interlocking rhythms--the  rollicking, vodka-soaked sound of a steam calliope gone  mad.\" Three groups have named themselves Klezmania!  (San Francisco, Boston, and Melbourne, Australia) and a  New England high school band calls itself Klezmaniacs.   Parody is an example of what Steven Mullaney has  called a rehearsal of culture--namely, a performance that  is self-consuming in the sense that it is \"ultimately  organized around the elimination of its own pretext.\"120  As ethnographic burlesque, which has a long history and  was a tool of the Jewish Enlightenment, such parody  displays its target in extraordinary detail and makes that  display a vehicle for sensibility, which is what animates  the parody in the first place. Stempenyu, discussed by  Rothstein in this issue, is a case in point.  The Jewish wedding has long been the focus of such  treatment. A kind of primal scene of Jewish survival, the  wedding is where the promise and crisis of cultural  reproduction and biological survival get addressed both in  reverential and parodic performances of Jewish wedding  music and comic routines. Recordings of wedding  parodies were all the rage in the twenties, as Slobin has  noted, and not just among Jews.121 A comparison of  Jewish wedding parodies over time would chart a history  of changing structures of feeling from David Fr \"Gallery of Obnoxious Abuses, Shocking Customs, and  Absurd Ceremonies of the Jews,\" in Sulamit during the  early nineteenth century to Der Mesader Kedushin and Di  boyberiker khasene in the twenties to Mickey Katz's  affectionate lobs of the fifties. Seen as musical  performances of cohort awareness, these displays of  cultural connoisseurship in the breach chart the  generational structure of sensibility and its sounds.122 No  one exemplifies this moment more vividly than Mickey  Katz.  In his roles as musician, comedian, and radio host,  Katz presided over the obsolescence of what he called  \"the old but little-known happy Jewish music of the old  country.\"123 Katz, who was born in 1909, had been doing  English-Yiddish parodies of fairy tales on the radio as a  teenager in Doc Whipple's big band in Cleveland in the  twenties. But it was only in 1947, after he broke up with  Spike Jones, that Katz made English-Yiddish parody a  speciality. The Barton Brothers had brought out several  parody records, which made Katz think there might be a  market for his own routines. Jewish executives at RCA  were taken with the idea and Katz proceeded to record  parodies of current hits. The first singles by Mickey Katz  and His Kosher Jammers were, by his own account, a sell  out success: \"I had given the Jewish record-buying public  something they evidently wanted and up to now hadn't  had.\"124 There followed the Borscht Capades, with his  son Joel Grey, and a stint as a \"kosher disc jockey\" in  Southern California from 1951 to 1956.125  In addition to playing his own records, Katz's radio  show featured everything from Al Jolson's \"The  Anniversary Waltz\" and Yiddish recordings by operatic  cantors to symphonic arrangements of Jewish folk music,  songs about the Holocaust, and Israeli recordings.  Summing up the experience, Katz writes: \"The greatest  personal satisfaction I got from my radio show was its  wide appeal. Thousands of people of all faiths loved the  haimish (homey) Jewish music and the lively  frailachs.\"126 Though Katz did most of his talking in  English, the Yiddish flavor of the show and the repertoire  he featured would have appealed to an older generation.  This assumption is borne out by the jokes he tells about  his audience:  Jewish mamas and papas have always loved waltzes.  There's a wonderful story about the old couple who were  dancing in Miami Beach. In the old days all the hotels  there had \"dancing classes.\" And since it was Florida, the  dancing classes usually featured Latin music. Well, one  day our elderly couple were dancing to Pupi Campo's  band at one of the hotels, and Sam, trying to keep up with  the lively Latin rhythm, was stepping all over his wife's  feet. Finally, she said, \"Waltz a little faster, Sam; they're  playing a fox-trot.\"127  While the show's success was a vindication of sorts,  by the early fifties, Katz was finding it \"slow going.\" He  was encountering resistance to his routines. After his first  show at Slapsie Maxie's in Los Angeles, the owner- manager came to Katz's dressing room and declared,  \"There will be no Yiddish done in this club!\" and Spike  Jones suggested Katz supply a libretto for the Yiddish- challenged.128 The Jewish manager of a radio station in  Los Angeles refused to play his records. He said Katz's  records were insulting and besides, \"I don't play any  ethnic records,\" which was not the case--he did play  Mexican music.129 A Philadelphia station manager (not  Jewish) refused to play Katz's records \"Because some of  our listeners are offended. . . . I will not play any record  with Yiddish in it. Yiddish is the language of the  ghetto.\"130  Katz, in the autobiography from which I take these  accounts, attributes the hostility he encountered to shame  on the part of Jews and anti-Semitism on the part of non- Jews--he also acknowledged that not everyone in his  audience could understand Yiddish. What he does not  address is precisely what some people found so funny and  others so \"insulting\" and \"offensive\" This is a subject  worthy of a study in its own right. Suffice it to note that  Katz's parodies of incompetence were highly virtuosic.  They required a mastery not only of multiple linguistic  and musical idioms, but also of incongruous  juxtapositions.131 This art, governed by a different  sensibility, lives on in such recordings as Rechnitzer  Rejects, which were produced in the eighties.132  Katz's Yiddish humor appealed to a contracting circle  of \"insiders\" as well as to the children of Yiddish speakers  for whom just the sound of Yiddish was funny or  offensive, quite apart from the meaning of the words.  Uriel Weinreich has noted how obsolescent languages  acquire esoteric value and comic associations: \"Among  the children of American immigrants, the mere utterance  of a word in their parents' language easily evokes  laughter.\"133 Whatever status Yiddish may have had as a  primary medium of communication, it is as an obsolescent  language, a stylistic specialization, that it figures in Katz's  English-Yiddish routines. It is characteristic of  obsolescent languages that \"colorful idiomatic  expressions, difficult to translate, with strong affective  overtones, whether endearing, pejorative, or mildly  obscene\" turn up in discourse that is \"informal and  uninhibited by pretensions of high social status.\"134 Food  terms are likely to be part of the mix. (Sure enough, they  turn up today in the humorous names of neo-klezmer  bands such as Nosh, Lox & Vodka, Hot Latkes, and  Shawn's Kugel.) Setting Yiddish lyrics to a hit parade tune  intensified the comic effect.  The mixed responses to Katz's performances in the  fifties point to shifts in sensibility. During the Cold War,  Jews had good reason to be nervous. Obsolescence is one  thing, genocide is another. As early as 1943, Maurice  Samuel described The World of Sholom Aleichem as an  act of necromancy, a calling up from the dead.135 He  converted what Sholem Aleichem's nineteenth-century  readers had read as satire into elegiac ethnography. The  World of Sholom Aleichem was one of several such  treatments of a destroyed world that appeared in the  forties and fifties. Others include Bella Chagall's Burning  Lights and Heschel's The Earth Is the Lord's: The Inner  World of the Jew in Eastern Europe, both of which  appeared in Yiddish and in English translation, and Life Is  with People: The Culture of the Shtetl, the first major  ethnography of East European Jewish culture to appear in  English.136 Ambivalence about that world, an  ambivalence that informed both the immigrant experience  and the Zionist movement, was put to a severe test after  World War II. It was one thing to be ambivalent about a  way of life that posed a threat to success in America or the  establishment of a Jewish homeland. Condemning a  destroyed world to oblivion was another matter.  Evocations of a vanished world reached their apogee  in Fiddler on the Roof (1964), which, together with Marc  Chagall's imagery, made the klezmer the icon of an  irretrievable world--and, from then on, albums of Yiddish  song often included songs from this popular musical.  However sentimental such elegies may seem to us today,  they attempted to deal with what came to be known as the  Holocaust before it was possible to deal directly with the  genocide. In a period where memory vacillated between  sad nostalgia and outraged horror, hope attached itself to  establishing a Jewish homeland and creating a new life  there or elsewhere.  No wonder Mickey Katz had a difficult time finding  a niche for his English-Yiddish parodies. They spoke to  the experience of an earlier generation of immigrants,  those who had come far enough to be able to laugh at the  \"incompetence\" Katz performed with such virtuosity. That  experience had become irrelevant, if not embarrassing, to  a suburbanized generation of respectable Jews. The  Yiddishists of the Yiddish day schools and summer  camps, Workman's Circle, and YIVO Institute for Jewish  Research considered Borscht Belt culture vulgar. It was a  threat to the Yiddish civilization for whose very survival  they fought. As for the newest Yiddish speakers to arrive  on the scene, a young generation of refugees and  survivors, what were they to make of Katz's parodies. In  the wake of the Holocaust, those routines had become an  irreverent tombstone, a sacrilege, an affront to changed  sensibilities. In the fifties, Bikel could write obscene  graffiti on the record cover of his first album of Yiddish  folk songs. Forty years later he would begin his  autobiography with the Holocaust, not with his birth, and  write of his own narrow escape, \"Maybe I was meant to  use my voice as a warning that history must not repeat  itself.\"137   The Jewish Space  Since the Holocaust, there have appeared innumerable  evocations of \"vanished communities,\" eleventh-hour  documentaries of the \"last Jews\" of Eastern Europe, and  increasingly, Holocaust memorials. Those memorials,  seen historically, also reflect shifts in sensibility,  particularly as the children of survivors find their own  voices. Art Spiegelman's Maus is but one example of what  Gilad Melzer calls irreverent memory. He considers the  problem of representing the Holocaust \"properly\" in  relation to new generational sensibilities and the  \"Holocaust rock music\" of such Israeli musicians as  Yehuda Poliker.138 Today, Central and Eastern Europe  are no longer the nowhere of an evacuated Yiddishland.  Not only is there a modest renewal of Jewish life and  communities and a major influx of Jewish tourists, but  also \"the 'Jewish space' in Europe . . . is increasingly  attracting non-Jews,\" in the words of historian Diana  Pinto.139 They are the primary audience in Europe for  klezmer music, particularly as performed by American  Jewish musicians, but also by bands with names like  Klezgoyim. In the estimation of Alan Bern, the virtuosic  accordionist in Brave Old World, some non-Jewish  musicians perform klezmer music \"better than Jewish  musicians who count as leaders of the revival.\"140 If, as  Liberman declared, old-time klezmorim \"bridged the  cultural abyss between the ghetto and the world,\" the neo- klezmers are filling a new kind of Jewish space, no less  imagined than the topoi of ghetto and shtetl.141  A hero of the contemporary European klezmer scene  is Giora Feidman. While the San Francisco Klezmorim  are generally credited with being the first to record neo- klezmer music, in 1977, Feidman debuted his Jewish  \"soul music\" in 1972 and issued his first klezmer album in  1973. \"King of Klezmer in the world today,\" Feidman  bases the purity of his performances of klezmer music not  on scrupulous attention to reconstruction but to distilling  the \"essence\" of what he calls \"Jewish soul music.\"142  Born of a romantic mysticism, his etherial musical  interpretations depend more on inspiration than fidelity to  an authoritative musical \"text.\" The preciousness of his  performances is better suited to the concert stage and  movie soundtrack, than to the dance floor or downtown  club. While his fans embrace his music as a \"universal  language\" and medium of international brotherhood, his  critics object to his rarefied treatment of an earthy musical  idiom. They object to his sensibility; liner notes for his  early albums refer to \"Jewish Folk Music\" and \"little  worlds\" (among them Fiddler on the Roof and  contemporary Israel) and his repertoire draws from film  scores as well as Hasidic Music Festivals and the music of  Middle Eastern Jewish communities living in Israel.  \"Maestro Feidman,\" as he is referred to on his albums  and on The Giora Feidman Home Page, is not of the same  cohort as the American neo-klezmers. Born in Argentina,  Feidman immigrated to Israel in 1957 to accept the  invitation to join the clarinet section of the Israel  Philharmonic Orchestra. While he describes himself as a  fourth-generation klezmer, it is precisely this yikhes (and  his extraordinary talent as a classical musician) that  authorizes his distillations and the bold claims he makes  for them. His largest followings are in Germany and  Israel, where relationships to the East European Jewish  past are particularly fraught, whether as the legacy of  Nazism or Zionism.  Groups like the Klezmer-Gesellschaft e.V, founded  in Berlin in 1990 and their Klezmer Orchestra, established  in 1995, are attracted to Feidman's celebration of klezmer  music's universality because it gives them \"permission\"  not only to play the music, but also to claim it:  klezmorim, they explain, \"usually were Jewish, but not  necessarily. They usually played at Jewish celebrations-- but not only. And that was why they integrated into their  repertoire the traditional music of their surroundings. The  style of playing and the repertoire are characterized by  both the tradition, vivid modifications, and new  perceptions. That is exactly, what we now call klezmer  music.\"143 The Klezmer-Gesellschaft was founded by  musicians who took Feidman's workshops and Feidman is  also a member of the society. He is an active teacher and  has issued numerous instructional recordings and books.  In the United States, Balkanarama has created a slot  for klezmer music in a list that includes Albania, Bosnia,  Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia,  Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, and The Roma (Gypsies). The  topos of music as place, a site of imagined community,  can be found in the instruction, \"Welcome to the Republic  of Balkanarama. Please surrender your passport at this  time.\"144 The place is then--a dreamy chronotope of  Jewish gypsies, fiddling their way from place to place,  picking up the sounds around them, and fusing them into  a zany foot-tapping musical icon pierced by the soulful  cry of a fiddle or clarinet.145 The place is not now.   Moreover, the music, once it has been universalized,  is no longer even Jewish--\"Klezmer is not Jewish music,\"  Feidman has said, explaining that \"Everyone is born a  singer. God gave to us an instrument of song, our body.  This is klezmer.\"146 Nothing could be further from the  sensibility of American neo-klezmers. Or, from those who  remember hearing the old-timers, some of whom were  young at the time and alternated playing Jewish and jazz  gigs. The \"indigenous music\" of klezmorim, which Nat  Hentoff defined as \"improvising Yiddish musicians,\"  reminded him of jazz, but with a critical difference: \"the  cadences, the timbres, the swirling rhythms went back to  far different places and times than the jazz I also loved. It  was more from these sounds than from any reading that  my sense of the old country first began to be vivid.\"147 If  the music took Nat Hentoff back to Minsk and Pinsk and  offered David Krakauer a \"musical home,\" it lets Don  Byron \"take you to a place you may have avoided and  make you feel comfortable there.\"148 That place is out. It  is on the edge. It is radical in the contradictory senses of  rooted and extreme. Such are the fault lines of sensibility  defined by klezmer music of the nineties.

{"detail": [{"content": "Appeared in Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, Issue issue, no. 185. Vol. 47, no. 1 (Winter 1998), special issues on klezmer  music, pp. 49-788.  ------------------  Sounds of Sensibility  Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett  Today's klezmer scene, while it affirms a degree of  musical continuity with the past, is in fact the result of an  experience of rupture. Reviewing The Klezmorim's first  album, East Side Wedding, in 1977, Nat Hentoff  commented that \"For years now, I had thought the  klezmorim to be nearly extinct. Oh, some old players  must still be boldly wailing in some dwindling Orthodox  Jewish neighborhoods, but surely they are the last of their  line.\" When he heard them, he \"would close his eyes and  grin at the ghosts of my clan in Minsk and Pinsk.\" Now,  he continued, a new generation has \"taken up and merrily  revivified this heritage.\"1 At the time, Hentoff heard the  past. Years later, Lev Liberman, who co-founded The  Klezmorim in 1975, would look back and see harbingers  of the future: \"I'd like to think that the current klezmer  revival had its origins in our early experiments with tight  ensemble playing, improvisation, klezmer/jazz fusions,  neo-klezmer composition, street music, world beat, and  New Vaudeville.\"2   In the hiatus between the old and the new players can  be found keys to changes of sensibility that have made  today's scene possible. Whatever their ostensible subject,  the essays in this issue sound the sensibilities specific to  the klezmer phenomenon of the last twenty-five years.  They show \"klezmer music\" to be a powerful index of  what Raymond Williams has called changing structures of  feeling. Williams distinguishes feeling (\"meanings and  values as they are actively lived and felt\") from ideology  (\"formally held and systematic beliefs\"), noting that they  are of course interrelated in practice: \"Methodologically,  then, a 'structure of feeling' is a cultural hypothesis,  actually derived from attempts to understand such  elements [affective elements of consciousness and  relationships] and their connection in a generation or  period, and needing always to be returned, interactively,  to such evidence.\"3 The essays gathered here provide rich  evidence of just such \"affective elements of  consciousness\" and their historical location.  My essay explores the historical formation of the  klezmer phenomenon in terms of changing structures of  feeling. I begin by considering arguments over  terminology--not only the term klezmer, but also the word  revival--and how these debates situate klezmer music  within a larger musical landscape. I then relate the  klezmer phenomenon to what Haim Soloveitchik has  called the end of self-evident Jewishness.4 While  stringent orthodoxy is one outcome of the tension between  tradition and ideology, the klezmer revival is another.  There follows an analysis of the fault lines of sensibility  in the period immediately preceding the klezmer revival.  While the popularity of old-time Jewish wedding music  declined and an incipient heritage orientation to it can be  detected within the Jewish music world of the time, this  music was notably absent from the folk song and music  revivals of the fifties and sixties. To better understand this  absence, I contrast the musical sensibilities of Theodore  Bikel, an international folk singer who specialized in  Yiddish, Hebrew, and Russian songs, and Mickey Katz,  who performed English-Yiddish comedy and musical  parodies for a largely Jewish audience. Seen not as a  musical wasteland, but as a plenum of shifting  sensibilities, the fifties and sixties hold clues to the  emergence of the klezmer revival in the seventies, its  efflorescence in the nineties, and its changing character in  the United States and in the \"Jewish space\" of Europe  today.5    The Klezmer Phenomenon  What to call this scene and how to characterize the music  are matters of ongoing debate. As Williams writes of  keywords more generally, the term klezmer is tangled up  with the phenomenon it is being used to discuss.6 While  klezmer music, klezmer musicians, and klezmer revival  are commonly heard terms, Andy Statman recently said  that the music he plays is not klezmer but Hasidic, and  Giora Feidman has declared that \"Klezmer is not Jewish  music.\"7 Some take issue with the term revival. Vurma  Klezmer Orkester, a young Swedish band, insist on two  revivals, not one, and see themselves as part of the  \"second renaissance\" of the music, the first one having  occurred in the late seventies.8 Others reject the term  revival. Either they argue that Jewish instrumental music  never \"died\" or they insist that what today's musicians are  doing is not revival, but something utterly contemporary.   Most would agree with Frank London, in his essay in  this issue, that \"klezmer . . . has gone from an underused  term to being overgeneralized.\" In 1981, before klezmer  music was an established category, the jacket for The  Klezmorim Metropolis carried the following instruction:  \"File under: Folk or Jazz.\"9 Since then klezmer music has  become not only an identifiable genre, but also a highly  differentiated phenomenon. It is now not possible to speak  generally of a klezmer revival, a klezmer scene, or a  Jewish music scene as if there was a single entity.  \"Klezmer\" or \"klez\" (it is not even necessary to specify  \"music\") circulates within a vast musical landscape. Part  of the success of the music in today's popular music  market stems from the strategic placement of the music.  As Joel Lewis notes in his review of a Klezmatics concert  in 1995, they play \"the Ashkenazic Jewish folk music  known as klezmer\" but \"have a broad enough appeal to fit  equally into the programs of folk, jazz and world music  festivals.\"10 They aren't \"trapped inside a musical  'shtetl.'\"11  Not only is klezmer one of several kinds of Jewish  music on a Sunday morning music show that features  \"Israeli/Jewish/Klezmer/Yiddish\" music,12 Klezmer has  also become a kind of \"world music.\" The Klezmatics  describes itself as \"the planet's radical Jewish roots band,\"  Klezmos plays \"World Klez music,\" and Rubinchik's  Orkestyr features \"Old-World Beat\" (a pun on Old World  and world beat).13 The music of Brave Old World has  been described as \"world-Jewish.\" Ben Brussell identifies  the format of Klezmania! (San Francisco) as \"definitive  world music.\" In order to tell the many klezmer bands  apart, musicians and critics identify ever more eclectic  and specific musical alignments and orientations. The  Cayuga Klezmer Revival band characterizes its style  variously as \"folk/roots/electric/acoustic/\" and \"jazz, rock,  swing, folk ska, and reggae\" and identifies its repertoire as  \"a mixture of traditional Eastern-European tunes, Ladino,  Israeli, and original tunes.\"14 The British group Souls of  Fire performs \"klezmer-roots-worldbeat-dance.\" HaLaila  calls its music \"tribal Jewish funk, or depending on our  mood, 'acid klez.'\"   Objections to the term notwithstanding, \"revival\"  speaks to a rupture of cultural transmission in postwar  America. During the early fifties, while playing in Las  Vegas, Mickey Katz was approached by a Texan who  asked him to play some \"Jew music\": \"I haven't heard me  a good frailach since my bar mitzvah down in Waco,\" the  Texan explained. Katz complied and \"played him some  Jewish jazz.\"15 By the seventies, the \"Texan Hebrew\"  would have been able to hear those freylekhs again and  then some. During the intervening years, however, many  stellar performers of the music he remembers from his bar  mitzvah party were no longer active or had passed away.  Nor had the music been enshrined as heritage in the way  that many other musics were.16 Indeed, performers like  Henry Sapoznik came to the Jewish instrumental tradition  through other heritage musics, in his case Appalachian,  while others started from Balkan heritage music. As  Robert Cantwell has argued, \"many kinds of music that at  other periods had been commercially performed and  recorded, such as blues, old-time, and bluegrass music-- music of chiefly southern or southeastern rural origin-- came to be regarded as folk music and enjoyed a revival  on that basis, to be followed in the next decade by Irish  ceili, Klezmer, and other ethnic musics.\"17 It was only a  matter of time, in Hankus Netsky's view, before Jewish  instrumental music would reemerge: \"Archaic things  come back. . . . The blues came back. . . . And the same  thing eventually happened when our generation came of  age and said, 'Wait a minute. What happened? Where's  our folk music?'\"18  Sapoznik's now legendary account of his career is a  vivid case in point. While the Texan Jew would fondly  remember the \"Jew music\" of his bar mitzvah in the  thirties, Sapoznik remembers hating the music at his bar  mitzvah in the sixties:  My parents had hired one of the top New York City  klezmer clarinetists to play at the reception. So there he  was on the bandstand blowing some of the best bulgars in  the business and all I wanted to do was to crawl into the  nearest, deepest hole.  \"Can't this guy play anything modern?\" the bar  mitzvah kvetshed. At that point all my life had been spent  in the presence of this music. I made no distinction  between the hasidic nigunim we sang on the schoolbus  going to Lubavitch yeshiva or the klezmer and Yiddish  music ubiquitously heard at the Catskill hotels where we  sang during Passover. I thought everybody had a cantor  father who wandered around the house softly humming  the High Holidays liturgy to himself.19  Sapoznik's parents had paid for klezmer, but he  wanted rock'n'roll. His sense of rupture pointed not to the  music but to interest in it: \"The music was patiently  waiting for us to hear it again.\" Meanwhile, Sapoznik  played rock'n'roll, made his way through the folk song  revival (Woody Guthrie, Cisco Houston, Bob Dylan), and  \"soon found myself getting into more traditional kinds of  music: Irish, New England Contradances, but mainly  Appalachian string band music.\" In the mid-seventies,  Sapoznik was visiting Tommy Jarrell, a senior Southern  string musician, when Jarrell, observing that many Jews  were interested in old-time music, asked Sapoznik:  \"Hank, don't your people got none of your own music?\"  Sapoznik was stunned. He headed back to New York,  consulted with his grandfather, who was the same age as  Jarrell, and began the search for his \"own music.\"20  I use the term \"heritage music\" to distinguish  between music that is part and parcel of a way of life and  music that has been singled out for preservation,  protection, enshrinement, and revival--in a word, heritage  music. Heritage music, as it emerges from Hentoff's  account of hearing The Klezmorim for the first time,  verges on necromancy--literally a conjuring up of the  dead. \"Heritage,\" as I have argued elsewhere, is a mode of  cultural production that gives the disappearing and gone a  second life as an exhibit of itself.21 In 1977, Hentoff  wrote of a new generation of musicians revivifying-- literally, giving new life to--a nearly extinct musical  \"heritage.\" At the same time, he distanced himself from  \"heritage\" when he conceded that although Liberman was  \"director of music and arts at the Judah Magnes Museum  in Berkeley, California . . . he and his colleagues do not  play as if they are in a museum.\"22   It is significant, however, that two pioneering  klezmer figures, Liberman and Sapoznik, found support  for their early efforts in the context of Jewish arts  institutions--Sapoznik was project director of the Jewish  music research project at the Martin Steinberg Center for  Jewish Arts of the American Jewish Congress from 1977  to 1979, thanks to government support in the form of  SETA grants. This is the period during which folk arts  became recognized as a division or funding category or  priority within government agencies such as the National  Endowment for the Arts (1974), the New York State  Council for the Arts (1980), and the American Folklife  Center at the Library of Congress (1976). The  Smithsonian Institution, which had established the  American Folklife Festival in 1967, featured Jews at their  bicentennial festival in 1976.23 Situated in these agencies  and in state arts councils, professionally trained folklorists  and ethnomusicologists curated, evaluated, and otherwise  guided increasingly sophisticated heritage programs in the  public sector. The Klezmer Conservatory Band was  incubated at the New England Conservatory of Music in  Boston, where Hankus Netsky taught and eventually  chaired the Jazz Studies department.  Almost twenty years later, Seth Rogovoy, who is  writing a book on the klezmer revival, would praise the  \"downtown jazz artists who don't approach it [klezmer  music] as a fossilized object of ethnomusicological  interest but as a living form worthy of updating and  experimentation.\"24 The formulation \"living form\" is less  an affirmation of continuity than a statement of aesthetic  orientation. It suggests a musical point of departure rather  than an historical destination.   The klezmer revival accommodates not only  historical and aesthetic orientations, but also religious  ones. Describing a recent concert by the David Krakauer  Trio, Rogovoy writes that \"A standing-room-only crowd  jammed the pews and aisles of St. James Church on  Tuesday night to worship at the altar of klezmer.\"25 As a  metaphor for the enthusiasm of fans, \"worship at the altar  of klezmer\" suggests that listening to the music is (or is  like) a religious experience. Such metaphors are  reminders that the term revival has historically been  associated with religious revivals.26 Revivalist carries the  sense of renewed attention and new presentation (an  orientation to the past), while revitalist--Hasidism has  been characterized as a revitalist movement--suggests new  life or vigor (a program for the future).27 The distinction  between revivalist and revitalist tends to blur, and the  terms are sometimes used interchangeably with each  other, and with renewal. Both are often associated with  youth and countercultures, as is klezmer. While it would  be going too far to call them youth movements, Hasidism,  and for that matter the Haskala, attracted youthful  followers during the early period of their formation.  Both professional and amateur bands often  characterize the spirit of their performances in terms of a  religious experience--not the sedate murmurings of polite  synagogues but something more akin to ecstatic  possession or altered states of consciousness. The  Klezmatic's most recent album is titled Possession.28  Appropriately enough, tracks 9 through 17 are from the  score created by the Klezmatics for Tony Kushner's  adaptation of Sh. An-ski's A Dybbuk, a play about the  transmigration of a soul--Kushner himself, in the liner  notes, characterizes the music as \"so full of August  Mystery.\"29 Musicians and those who write about them  speak of madness, wildness, frenzy, hysteria, and passion.  Call it the youthful enthusiasm of devoted aficionados.  Here again there are religious connotations: the etymology  of enthusiasm is inspiration and the primary meaning of  inspiration is \"a divine influence or manifestation that  qualifies a person to receive and communicate sacred  revelation.\"30 Divine inspiration is a redundancy.   Some bands have adopted names (and record titles)  that invoke a generally spiritual or religious sensibility or  refer more specifically to Judaism or Hasidism and its  musical repertoire, to mention only Frank London's  Hasidic New Wave project, Farbrangen Fiddlers, Souls of  Fire, Thread of Blue, and Burnt Offering. Some of these  bands are associated with synagogues. Others are not. In  the case of Souls of Fire, a British band, none of the  members is Jewish. Giora Feidman, who debuted his  Jewish \"soul music\" in 1972 and his records of this music  in 1973, has used album titles such as The Dance of Joy  and The Magic of Klezmer. In claiming to distill the  essence of \"Jewish soul music\" and to universalize it,  Feidman expresses a romantic mysticism reminiscent of  the fin-de-si\u000fcle Orientalism of Martin Buber and his  circle.31 Since his religious awakening, Andy Statman  insists that what is now called klezmer music was always  religiously mandated and cites its role in the fulfillment of  the mitzvah of simkhe on the occasion of a wedding. This  is the reason he gives for calling the music he plays today  Hasidic, rather than klezmer, though one critic has  characterized it as \"a sort of Jewish/new-age fusion.\"32   Arguments over what to call the phenomenon and  how to characterize the music were once dominated by the  experience of rupture and recovery. The debates have  intensified and their character has changed as the musical  formation called (or not called) klezmer expands,  diversifies, and matures.   Heritage, Tradition, Orthodoxy  To better understand the terms of these debates, the  musical practices with which they are associated, and the  historical processes of their unfolding, I will explore three  distinctions: feeling and ideology (Raymond Williams),  tradition and ideology (Haim Soloveichik), and tradition  and heritage. \"Tradition,\" the opening number of Fiddler  on the Roof, performs the distinction between tradition  and heritage simply by making such a fuss over what is  otherwise taken for granted. \"Tradition\" can no longer be  assumed because it is under attack. When all is said and  done Fiddler on the Roof is a performance of heritage, not  tradition, because the Broadway musical offers the  disappearing and gone a second life as an exhibition of  itself. Heritage is coded at every level--diegesis (the  narrative), mimesis (the representation), and the  performance artifact itself.  Fiddler on the Roof is also a long way from  contemporary orthodoxy, which Soloveitchik  distinguishes from tradition. Though he focuses on the  transformation of contemporary orthodoxy, his distinction  between tradition and orthodoxy is relevant to a  consideration of the klezmer phenomenon. \"A traditional  society has been transformed into an orthodox one\" when  what was a matter of course (what was once absorbed and  habitual) has become subject to rules, formal teaching,  and scrupulous attention to textual authority.33 The result  is not \"heritage,\" but a tendency toward stringency  (humra).34 As a result, \"performance is no longer, as in a  traditional society, replication of what one has seen, but  implementation of what one knows.\"35 This trend started  in the mid-fifties \"and by the mid-seventies was well on  its way to being, if it had not already become, the  dominant mode of religiosity.\"36 The result is what he  calls \"a performative spirituality, not unlike that of the  arts, with all its unabating tension.\"37  Soloveitchik uses an explicitly musical metaphor,  \"For spiritual life is an attempt, as a great pianist once put  it, to play music that is better than it can be played.\"38  Applied to klezmer music, the humra principle is most  clearly expressed by Austrian-based Budowitz, an  \"ensemble of Klezmer veterans performing early Jewish  repertoire and style on historical instruments.\"39 Taking  their cue from the early music movement, they perform  music that critics have described as \"Very pure. The kind  of music that enthralled Bartok and Kodaly.\"40  The shift that Soloveitchik describes--\"the aspiration  will be . . . more to purity of ideology than of impulse--is  precisely the distinction that Williams makes between  ideology and feeling.41 Gone is the yidishkayt that was  \"something deep in the bone,\" a Judaism whose essence  \"lay not in law or ritual, but in a social vision (yoysher)  and a moral standard of conduct (mentshlikhkeyt).\"42 He  attributes the end of \"self-evident Jewishness\" to a  \"rupture in the traditional religious sensibilities\" once  rooted in what he calls the mimetic society.43   Stringent orthodoxy is not the only response to the  end of \"self-evident\" Jewishness, though it could be said  that what counts as self-evident Jewishness has come to  an end more than once. What I have been calling heritage- -and klezmer music is in many ways a case in point--is a  second outcome. Historians of European popular culture  such as Peter Burke and E. P. Thompson have argued that  pressures on \"customary consciousness and customary  usages\" prompt the emergence of \"folklore\" at emerging  divides between high and low culture, as the upper ranks  collect \"folklore\" from the lower ranks.44 When the  Haskala applied pressure on customary consciousness and  practices, Jewish folklore emerged from the outtakes of  reform.45 What had been rejected as tradition would  eventually be embraced as heritage.   An ideological relationship to tradition among  haredim as well as among the new klezmers arises from a  ruptured past that \"gave them free reign to create a  familiar past of which the present was simply an  extension.\"46 On their first album, East Side Wedding  (1977), The Klezmorim explained that \"To rediscover the  unashamed passion and hysteria of authentic Jewish  music, you have to journey to the limits of living  memory,\" which they identified with the period of mass  immigration and \"neglected manuscripts and forgotten 78  rpm recordings.\"47 On their 1981 album, The Klezmorim  Metropolis, they declared, \"We are The Klezmorim. We  play klezmer music. It's been underground for fifty years.  Now it's back.\"48 Frank London has noted that The  Klezmorim \"never once mentioned Jews or being Jews. It  was just klezmer, klezmer, klezmer\" and added in a later  interview, \"For years, many of the klezmer bands hid  behind the word 'klezmer' as a way of avoiding the  'Jewish' word.\"49 This is an astute observation.   The word Jewish does appear on The Klezmorim's  first album, but strictly in an historical context. The  \"Jewishness\" of their project is carried instead by the  word Yiddish and the prominence of Yiddish terms, song  titles, and lyrics. They are klezmers by affinity, rather  than by descent or Jewish identification. Where bloodlines  are absent--Hankus Netsky, Judy Bressler, Henry  Sapoznik, and Giora Feidman identify with Jewish  instrumentalists and Yiddish performers in their families-- affinities are invoked. Like their historical models, The  Klezmorim explain, they started out playing in small  bands, they improvise, they arrange their numbers  communally and by ear, and they take pride in never  playing a solo the same way twice.  In the absence of living models, particular  importance is accorded texts (and in the case of klezmer  music, records). Defining the relationship of  contemporary performance to past models as best they can  be reconstructed is an ongoing concern. As London  commented, \"Whenever we think we are being very now,  very new, we find out what we have done is actually very  traditional.\"50 The sense of newness in the old and  oldness in the new is also conveyed in a band name like  Brave Old World and characterizations like \"Making old- world music new.\"51 Kapelye's first album was entitled  Future and Past and carried the following dedication:  \"This album is dedicated to our families who have taught  us that our future is our Jewish past.\"52  Anachronism is a productive principle, a musical  aesthetic, which operates by unsettling temporal direction.  There is no smooth continuity from yesterday's klezmorim  to today's klezmers. There is no dramatic rupture, no  simple sequence of life, death, and rebirth, as the term  revival would imply. Instead, old and new are in a  perpetually equivocal relationship. The future precedes  the past, the new precedes the old, the revival precedes its  historical models. While klezmer revival suggests the  primacy of recovery, initially a copying of what can still  be heard on old records and from elderly musicians, \"it is  the copying that originates,\" as Clifford Geertz has so  aptly stated, even in the case of meticulous musical  reconstructions.53   Klezmer musicians have felt a need to root present  practice in a meaningful past, which is not the same as  searching for roots, though for many the two come  together. Even the term \"roots music\" conveys a sense of  rootedness, rather than an exclusive claim to a singular  origin. However much klezmer music offered clarinetist  David Krakauer a \"musical home,\" it was its fusion with  jazz that gave his compositions what one reviewer  characterized as \"a thoroughly contemporary sensibility,\"  no doubt because that fusion did not produce melting-pot  music or a soft universalism or easy affirmation of a  singular ethnic identity.54 A sense of rootedness does not  require musical monogamy.   While orthodoxy and heritage do not by any means  exhaust the possible outcomes of rupture, they do force us  to rethink any easy opposition between conservative and  radical, tradition and innovation, custom and ideology. As  Thompson notes for his period, the eighteenth and  nineteenth centuries, \"So far from having the steady  permanence suggested by the word 'tradition', custom was  a field of change and contest, an arena in which opposing  interests made conflicting claims . . . it is an arena of  conflictual elements, which requires some compelling  pressure--as, for example, nationalism or prevalent  religious orthodoxy or class consciousness--to take form  as 'system'.\"55 Not only religious orthodoxy but also the  klezmer revival have taken form as system. Indeed, the  klezmer revival is an example of what Neil Rosenberg, in  his taxonomy of music revivals, calls a named-system  revival--others include Balkan, old-time fiddling, blues,  and bluegrass.56 System in this context signals the shift  from tradition to ideology.  What can be learned in this regard from the fate of  East European Jewish instrumental music among Hasidim  and haredim in America and Israel? While an earlier  American generation considered even kosher versions of  swing and jazz \"alien to a 'Jewish rejoicing' (yidishe  simche),\" their children and grandchildren were open to  rock beat and to kosher rock, that is, to rock with  acceptable lyrics, a shift that Soloveitchik attributes to the  embourgeoisement of American-born haredim.57 Hoping  to find klezmer music still going strong and without  interruption among those who seem to hew to tradition  most vigorously, Joel Rubin turned to haredim in Israel,  the subject of his essay in this issue. He offers several  reasons for why he did not find what he expected,  including the low status of professional musicians in  haredi society and the rabbinical ban in the 1860s on  instrumental music in Eretz Israel. In other words, Rubin  found himself exploring music within a religious  community, not a music scene. This is not to say that a  religious music scene does not exist, whether here or in  Israel, but only that klezmer music as such is not its  focus.58 According to Rubin, Hasidic and haredi  communities in Israel are not part of the new klezmer  scene, though there is some musical traffic and Rubin  himself is something of a bridge between the two worlds.  Those worlds are separated by more than music.    Catalytic Ruptures  A delay in the heritage process prior to the klezmer  revival not only left Jewish party music to the vicissitudes  of sensibility, but also spared it from the very ideological  attachments, from the political and religious engagements,  that gave other forms of Jewish music and musical  practices a competitive advantage at the time. The music  of American Jewish wedding musicians faded from view  for some of the very reasons that would make it attractive  to the generation that later picked it up. No movement,  whether political or religious, had claimed this kind of  music. Israeli music was sustained by the Zionist  movement, the labor movement had its songs, mandolin  orchestras, and choral groups, and both had their youth  groups and summer camps. The synagogues had their  cantors, choirs, and schools. In contrast, professional  instrumentalists worked for a market, not a movement.  Though movements also constitute a market of sorts,  movements give precedence to ideological considerations.  To better understand why the lapse was catalytic, it is  useful to compare the turning to \"klezmer\" music during  the seventies, described by Frank London and Alicia  Svigals in their contributions to this issue, with the turning  from the \"old but little-known happy Jewish music of the  old country\" that Mickey Katz was still playing in the  fifties.59 The two moments are deeply implicated in one  another, both musically (Katz's material has made a kind  of comeback) and in terms of structures of feeling (his  stigmatized irreverence is a badge of honor for a  subsequent generation). As Don Byron explained, he was  attracted to \"the mischief in [klezmer] music\" and found  in Mickey Katz, a master of mischief: \"I tend to gravitate  to whoever is playing the trickiest, outest stuff, and that's  where I live,\" whether the music be \"klezmer, jazz, big  band, or improvisation.\"60   That the music was not previously picked up cleared  the path for receiving it in purely aesthetic terms. This is  how many musicians first became interested in it--London  is emphatic on this point. So is John Zorn. A saxophonist  and composer, Zorn curated the Radical New Jewish  Culture Festival at the Knitting Factory in New York City  in 1993, and has issued klezmer/jazz/funk fusions on his  Tzadik label. For Zorn, \"All music is on equal grounds  and there's no high art and low art.\" His compositional  approach has been described as jumping \"from style to  style the way a television picture does when a deranged  channel surfer has the remote control.\"61 The \"roots\" of  this radicalism are more likely to lie in avant-garde  aesthetics and Jewish political activism than in religious  orthodoxy or folkloric heritage, though there are  exceptions like Andy Statman.  It could be said that Statman is reconfiguring the  relationships between tradition, heritage, and orthodoxy in  his live connection to Hasidic nigunim, spiritual take on  jazz, and religious orientation to performance. Statman's  newest CD, Between Heaven & Earth: Music of the  Jewish Mystics, reclaims \"klezmer as sacred music\" and  produces \"a sort of Jewish/new-age fusion,\" according to  Rogovoy.62 As I noted earlier, Statman insists that this  music was always religiously mandated and insists that it  is Hasidic, not klezmer music. Though he calls his band  The Andy Statman Klezmer Orchestra, Statman has said,  \"I don't like to use the word 'klezmer.' It becomes very  limiting,\" a statement that hints at shifts in aesthetic and  not only religious sensibility.63   The very name of his ensemble aligns it with such  early bands as the Abe Schwartz Orchestra, Harry  Kandel's Orchestra, Art Shryer's Modern Jewish  Orchestra, rather than with the revival bands. Revivalists  are more likely to invoke other musics (Yid Vicious, The  Freilachmakers Old-Time String Band, Mazeltones,  Jumpin' Jazzy Jewish Music). Revivalists tend to display a  playful, even nostalgic, relationship to the tradition (Di  Ganeyvim, Shir Fun, Kudzu Klezmer, Take the Oy Train).  They are likely to identify with the immigrant history of  the music and musicians (Greena Kozinas, Hester Street  Troupe, and Ellis Island). And, most of all, they proudly  identify themselves and their music as klezmer, a term  that earlier generations of musicians considered an insult.  Whatever its status might have been when it was a  functioning part of East European Jewish life, as outsider  music (The Klezmorim called it \"underground music\"),  the instrumental tradition was vulnerable to a rupture in  transmission. That rupture has given shape and direction  to the new klezmer music and its various sensibilities and  ideologies. That the music was once stigmatized is an  asset for a generation committed to new forms of  radicalism like the Queer Yiddishist movement identified  by Svigals. For prominent Jewish klezmer performers like  the Klezmatics and their Jewish audiences, klezmer music  gives voice to what they call the Radical Jewish Culture  movement.   Klezmer music has become the sound of particular  forms of identification, as can be seen in Svigals's  \"Manifesto.\" Whether defined positively (queer  Yiddishism, socialist Jewish past, serious approach to the  music) or negatively (no nostalgia, no \"tourism of the  past,\" no cuteness, no apologetics, no fetishizing of  authenticity), \"the identity music of Jewish American  youth\" envisioned by Svigals articulates distinctive  sensibilities and their sounds. While the scene (actually  several interlocking scenes) has many of the features  associated with youth subcultures, as Svigals shows, it is  also intergenerational, a feature that London specially  values.  London, who is now drawn to \"the secular, social  activist Yiddish song tradition,\" did not start out that way.  Quite the opposite. Klezmer music initially captured his  interest because it is \"good, just on its own terms.\" It is  one of many kinds of music he plays. When he says of his  first experience with the music that \"It really started in the  middle of nowhere,\" he is describing what it is like to  engage with music that is literally separated from its  source.64 Recordings make it possible to circulate the  sounds of music without circulating the musicians. This  disjunction not only heightens the experience of  \"nowhere\" that London describes, but also his sense that  \"one can study and assimilate the elements of any musical  style, form, or tradition by ear,\" a legacy of the historical  avant-garde.65 This aesthetic practice is intensified by the  situation of music without memory--or, in some cases, in  spite of memory.  If London could play any kind of music then anyone  could play Jewish music--and they did, though doing so  was not so straightforward. As Don Byron explained,  \"I've played klezmer music since 1980. But it hasn't been  easy to feel entitled to play it. A white man plays world  music, and no one questions the ethnic connection. But  not too many brothers are playing music from Bulgaria. I  spent hundreds of hours transcribing Katz's records: I feel  entitled to the knowledge, entitled to participate. But what  amazes people is that I'm a black guy doing the music of  people who are supposed to be white.\"66  London says he played this music despite, not  because, of the fact that he is Jewish. Being Jewish was  actually an obstacle because his experience of growing up  with Jewish music had left him feeling that it was corny.  When he embraced klezmer music, London was also  refusing \"all the shlock, all the shmaltz, all the things  about Jewish music that never interested me, all the Israeli  music, all the Yiddish theater music, about all that  sentimentality.\" Not roots and heritage, but technical  challenge, fun, and the market drove his initial interest in  the music, much as it did his captivation with jazz.  It is precisely this disjunction--music coming out of  nowhere--that allowed London to engage klezmer music  at all. Not only had the music been detached from its  historical moorings, but his generation could come  towards it with a detached attitude, an attitude they had  willed and cultivated. \"Nowhere\" is a space of abstraction  where sounds unmoored from other times and places can  be engaged as sound for its own sake. In that place called  nowhere, musicians can play anything. They do so in the  \"theme concerts\" London describes. Jewish was a theme.  It was resolutely not an \"identity\" or \"heritage.\"   Jewish, he soon discovered, was also a \"scene\" and it  is this scene that London and Svigals speak to in their  accounts from the inside, as musicians who have been part  of it, each in their own way, for almost two decades. It is  telling that London speaks in the spatial terms of nowhere  (and scene), not in the temporal terms of revival and  heritage. David Krakauer also uses a spatial metaphor  when he says of klezmer music that \"I felt in a certain way  that I had found a kind of musical home,\" though it is not  the only place he lives.67  While he attributes the secret of the Klezmatics'  success to their being \"a great rock band--that is, they  swing hard and get people emotionally,\" Michael Dorf,  who owns the Knitting Factory, adds that \"there is  something in their music that reaches the Jewish part of  me.\"68 This statement marks the distance traveled from  the sixties, when Milton Gordon in his study of  assimilation in American life could still warn his readers  that \"the individual who engages in frequent and sustained  primary contacts across ethnic group lines, particularly  racial and religious, runs the risk of becoming what, in  sociological parlance, has been called the 'marginal  man'.\"69 Gordon's marginal man, derived from Chicago  sociologists working in the twenties and thirties (Robert  E. Park and Everett V. Stonequist), was a \"social deviant\"  on the verge of nervous breakdown. Nothing could be  further from the sensibilities informing the klezmer music  scene.   The Jewish part of Dorf is clearly not all of him. The  other part, to which he attributes the Klezmatics' success,  has helped the music travel far beyond the wedding circuit  to which Jewish instrumental music had become confined.  During the first half of this century, the music could be  heard not only at simkhes, but also at banquets and social  and political functions of various kinds, Jewish caf\u000es and  restaurants.70 By the fifties, it was most likely to be heard  at weddings and in the English-Yiddish comedy shows by  performers like Mickey Katz.   Multiple Temporalities  Emphasizing a continuity they have worked hard to  achieve in the wake of genocide and cultural  obsolescence, pioneers of the klezmer revival repeatedly  delineate the chronology of the music they have  recuperated, a process that plays memory against history  and autobiography against musical reconstruction. While  the scene has a relatively short history, less than three  decades, telling that history is integral to it. The founding  figures not only tunneled to the past through archives, but  also sought out living bridges to the music as it was once  played. They apprenticed themselves to the last exponents  of the tradition. Their acts of recuperation, preservation,  documentation, and renewal affirmed Isaac Bashevis  Singer's apothegm, \"There's a big difference between  'dead' and 'dying',\" the motto of the Boston radio program  The Yiddish Voice (WUNR, Brookline,  Massachusetts).71   The founders of the scene have a keen sense of the  peculiar temporality of the revival. Unlike subsequent  generations, which have grown up with neo-klezmer  music, the founding cohort lived through the rupture and  the recovery, an experience that heightened their historical  awareness. Short and fast, the history of the scene is  remembered in detail by those directly involved in it.  Long and slow, the history of the music that inspires it has  left spotty evidence. Those who have made the scene have  also had to excavate the music. Their sense of one is  infused with their sense of the other. While a history of  klezmer music like the one provided by Hankus Netsky is  narrated forward, from the \"beginning\" to the present, it is  understood backwards, from now to then. Younger  musicians are forming their own sense of the music's  temporality, as can be seen from the claim by Vurma,  which models itself on \"the pioneer group Klezmorim,\"  that they are part of the second renaissance of klezmer. In  an interview about ten years ago, about the time they  disbanded, Kevin Linscott of The Klezmorim discouraged  new groups from using his band's music as a model and  encouraged them to go back to historical recordings.72  \"Klezmer music,\" as it emerges from what is said and  written and from the musical practices themselves, is an  \"initial shaping concept.\"73 It bears, as Williams puts it,  the marks of its formation and its unresolved problems,  both of which tend to be taken for granted. Hankus  Netsky, in his essay in this issue, starts with the European  background, immigration, and the recordings during the  first decades of this century in the United States. He  proceeds to the decline of klezmer music in the 1930s, the  parodies of the early postwar period, the sentimentality of  Jewish music of the 1960s, and the revival that began in  the 1970s (he founded the Klezmer Conservatory Band in  1980) and blossomed in the decades following.   Memory of the revival and history of the music are  not the same thing, though they tend to converge in  accounts that reflect the experience of first generation  klezmer revivalists and those who write about them. The  founding narrative is stated in the starkest terms by  Rogovoy, for whom klezmer is a phoenix rising from its  own ashes. The music is marked \"by its refusal to die\" in  the face of two assaults--the Holocaust and assimilation.  The revival is the story of what happened to \"Old World  Klezmer,\" whose \"sonorities . . . evoked the simple joys  and sorrows of shtetl life,\" in the hands of postmodern  musicians. At the same time, he documents the nuanced  sense of klezmer history expressed by Svigals, who is  quoted as saying, \"Klezmer isn't the music of an extinct  culture. . . . As contemporary living culture--as opposed  to something extinct which has been curiously and  artificially revived--Klezmer is different than it was  twenty years ago, and still more different than it was  forty, sixty, a hundred years ago.\"74 Rather than a  bifurcated temporality--before and after the revival--a  sense of differentiated historical layers is beginning to  emerge.  As professional musicians become professional  scholars, their historical vistas expand.75 Rubin looks  beyond the United States to Israel. James Loeffler, in his  contribution to this issue, looks beyond the \"golden age\"  of the interwar recordings to the early period of mass  immigration, during which the first Jewish musician's  union in the United States was established (1889). He  opens a window on the working conditions and  performance culture of professional Jewish musicians  during this era and considers their mobility. As the  musicians discussed by Loeffler entered the larger  marketplace of music, Jewish music became even more of  a niche market and some musicians, in their rising  success, left this music (and the Jewish musicians' union)  behind.   It is during the period of mass immigration that the  Yiddish theater came into its own, musicians began  making recordings, and Yiddish folk song attracted  increasing interest from scholars, artists, and publishers.  Because these developments took place in the United  States and in Europe, they did not precede immigration,  but were coincident with it. It has been argued that the  Yiddish theater and the instrumental music tradition as we  know it from early commercial recordings flowered in the  United States--performers and repertoire flowed across  the Atlantic in both directions.76 Moreover, during the  period Loeffler considers, musicians played not only for  simkhes but also on a wide variety of political,  ceremonial, and social occasions. His account offers an  important corrective to the current image of old-time  klezmer music as strictly party music.77  Loeffler's evidence suggests that specialization was a  response to a shrinking market. As they were no longer in  demand for so wide a range of events, those musicians  who continued playing for Jewish audiences came to  depend more heavily on simkhes for their living.78 They  could do so because Jewish life-cycle celebrations-- primarily the wedding, but also the bar mitzvah--had  become so much more elaborate. Those who still  remember hearing the music before the revival associate it  almost exclusively with simkhes. Many of today's  klezmers and critics project this image of the music back  to the middle ages. Rogovoy, for example, states that  \"Strictly defined, Klezmer is the Jewish instrumental  music that was played by professional musicians in  Eastern Europe for occasions such as weddings and bar  mitzvahs--a tradition that dates back at least as far as the  Middle Ages.\"79 As for weddings, the musical  requirements were far more extensive than dance music  and still are in Hasidic communities today. During the  nineteenth century (and earlier), wedding festivities could  extend over a three-week period and require musicians  and a varied repertoire for a series of events. As for bar  mitzvahs, in Eastern Europe they were generally low-key  events, not the extravagant affairs they have become  here.80  Complementing Loeffler's consideration of the  working conditions of Jewish instrumentalists in the  United States, Robert Rothstein, in his essay in this issue,  attends to the occupational subculture of professional  Jewish instrumentalists in Eastern Europe as revealed  through their argot. He presents a little klezmer-talk from  Sholem Aleichem's novel Stempenyu. In Joachim  Neugroschel's 1979 English translation, the klezmorim  sound like a couple of jazz hipsters rapping about chicks.  The translator has substituted one musical argot (jazz) for  another (klezmer), with the assumption that his readers in  1979 would recognize the lingo. Would the translation  need to be updated for subsequent generations by  substituting rap for jazz? If yes, something would be lost,  for American exponents of the klezmer tradition not only  played jazz. Many also referred to their bulgars, doinas,  and freylakhs as Jewish jazz and many played both Jewish  dance music and jazz on the same program.   Neugroschel's translation thus captures a musical  convergence subsequent to the period represented in the  novel, but meaningful to the later history of the music and  to later readers. Many musicians have come to neo- klezmer music with formal training in classical music and  jazz, and use what they know to create such new musical  fusions as freestyle klezmer. Objections to the term  Jewish jazz notwithstanding (Sapoznik quips that if  klezmer is Jewish jazz, then jazz must be goyish klezmer),  the relationship between the two musics suggests a history  of reversals as much as revivals, with musicians moving  from klezmer to jazz and back, while keeping both in play  and creating new fusions.81   Future translations of Stempenyu may have to reckon  with a new klezmer-loshn, the argot of the revival.  Variations on the word klezmer (klez, neo-klezmer,  klezmology, and klezmeroid) pepper discussions of the  music. Band names play with even more possibilities:  Klezmania!, Klezmatics, Klezical, Klezmechaye!,  Klezmos, Klezmotones, Kleztet, KlezKanada,  Klezmeydlekh. KlezKamp is the affectionate name of the  Yiddish Folk Arts Institute established by Henry Sapoznik  in 1984. The cyberhome of klezmer information is Ari  Davidow's KlezShack. This terminology has no parallel in  Yiddish, as evidenced by entry 285 (muziker [musician])  in Nahum Stutchkoff's monumental Thesaurus of the  Yiddish Language (1950) and the 1913  \"'Klesmer'sprache\" lexicons of S. Weissenberg and Alfred  Landau.82  There is no klezmer-loshn in Di vunderlikhe  geshikhte fun r' shmelkele der klezmer, a little chapbook  published in Warsaw in 1910) about eyn yidisher klezmer  in the Prague ghetto in 1820. Reb Shmelkele, a famous  artist on the fiddle and paragon of piety, played so well  that \"men hot gekent antshlofn vern fin siskayt\" (one  could fall asleep from sweetness). He was invited to play  for the hoi polloi. Christian nobility treated him with great  honor and even sent their carriages for him. At night, in  the privacy of his home, he would play \"Al Naharot  Bavel\" (By the Waters of Babylon) with such  moralishkayt that he could rouse feeling in a stone. He  was also handsome and humble. Not surprisingly, the tone  of the chapbook is pious, not sardonic.   Note that the anonymous author specifies \"Jewish\"  klezmer, but at no point does he refer to \"klezmer\" music.  Nor does he play with ethnographic detail--there is no  musician's argot--though he does endow Reb Shmelkele's  performance with extraordinary, even divinely inspired,  power. We do not find Reb Shmelkele playing at Jewish  weddings, but at elegant balls and aristocratic mansions,  the king's court and robber's den. These locales belong  more to the world of the wonder tale than to the daily  reality of Jewish instrumentalists, though klezmorim did  perform for the nobility. While this story cannot be taken  as a baseline for the history of klezmer music, it does  reveal an historically specific musical sensibility that  values emotive effect.83 This sensibility is allied with the  sentimentality of melodrama, a popular genre of Yiddish  theater in the period and even today in the Purim plays  produced by Hasidic communities in New York.84  Klezmer music--the term, the category, the music,  the sensibility--are not only contemporary, but new.  Jewish instrumentalists before the revival characterized  their music in a variety of ways, but klezmer music was  not one of them, a point that Statman underscores when  he says his band plays Hasidic, not klezmer, music.  However, Statman had to pass through the klezmer revival  to get to Hasidic music and once he got there he has been  moving in new directions that are difficult to name.    Incipient Heritage  Albums produced in the fifties, sixties, and early seventies  not only feature the performances of active wedding  musicians, but also reveal an incipient heritage orientation  to the instrumental tradition. Wedding Dances, featuring  clarinetist Marty Levitt and his orchestra, promises  listeners \"authentic WEDDING DANCES\" and assures  them that the music on this album will be as good \"as  when he performs in person at a traditional wedding\"-- hopefully listeners would hire him and his orchestra for  their simkhes.85 Rudy Tepel's 1962 album, Chasidic  Wedding: Rudy Tepel and His Orchestra Play Dance  Melodies of Vizhnitz, Lubavich, Modzitz, Satmar,  Skulen, Mea Shearim also features the performances of an  active musician.86 Tepel claimed a repertory of over six  hundred Hasidic melodies and estimated that he had  played close to five thousand weddings in a twenty-year  period.   The liner notes, however, also suggest an emerging  preservationist sensibility. They were prepared not by  Tepel, but by the producers of the album, the husband and  wife team B.-H. Stambler, who \"have been active for the  past fifteen years [i.e., since 1947] in gathering,  preserving and creating Jewish music. They have  pioneered in recording Hasidic and Sephardic music, and  in the restoration of historic cantorial discs.\" Accordingly,  the notes tell the listener little about the musical numbers  or the Hasidic dynasties and rebbes with whom they are  identified, but a lot about each stage of the wedding  festivities, information that insiders to the tradition would  not need. Records targeted to Hasidic communities are  more likely to focus on the history of a dynasty, its rebbe,  and his melodies, and to carry the admonition \"Please do  not play this record on the Sabbath or holidays.\"87  The note for the first number on Tepel's album,  \"Shpilt, Klezmorim!,\" uses the opportunity to offer a little  disquisition on klezmorim. After describing the sorry state  of part-time amateurs in the old country, the note  continues, \"Life in the United States has made a  tremendous change: today's klezmer is a successful, well- trained musician who devotes his full time to weddings;  these in turn have become elaborately catered affairs.\"  Rudy Tepel and his orchestra are characterized, not as  klezmorim, but as \"one of today's best-known wedding  bands.\" Consistent with this characterization, Tepel's  biographical note refers to him as a musician, not a  klezmer. Tepel expresses ambivalence in his careful  distinction between the Old World amateurs (klezmer) he  disavows and the American professionals (musicians)  with whom he identifies, the noble heritage intentions of  the Stamblers notwithstanding.  The liner notes for Rejoice: Torah in Song/Wedding  in the Old Country, a collaboration of Israeli, American,  and Canadian artists, most of them classically trained,  describe Dave Tarras as \"the greatest clarinet virtuoso of  Jewish folk music,\" a designation that already suggests a  shift of consciousness--neither Levitt nor Tepel described  what they played as folk music, though Levitt did promise  the \"authentic\" wedding dances that he plays at  \"traditional\" weddings.88 Tarras himself signaled the  shift, as Mark Slobin has noted, when he titled one of his  doinas \"Wedding on Second Avenue,\" a reference to the  Yiddish theater, which often included wedding scenes.89  The wedding and its music were literally staged for the  album.   A heritage orientation is even more explicit on Adele  Margolin's album Pages of History, which featured  \"Living Torah\" on one side and \"A Wedding in the Old  Tradition\" on the other.90 Margolin, a mezzo-soprano and  product of the Yiddish Folk Schools and Jewish Teachers  Seminary, hosted a Jewish music program on WLIB and  WEVD. The arrangement on Pages of History, played by  the Hebrew Folk Ensemble, was intended to make the  music \"sound like the 'Kappelia' (Miniature orchestra)  which was the major part of the entertainment at these  small town weddings. His [Amitai Ne'man,  arranger/conductor] successful handling of the subject met  with the approval of Folklorists who have been fortunate  to hear a true Kappelia in the old country.\" We see here  the hallmarks of \"heritage music.\" The music is not only  performed but also exhibited, glossed, translated, and  authenticated by \"folklorists.\"   These recordings circulated in Jewish circles. So did  reissues of great cantorial performances and artistic  reworkings of Yiddish folk songs by cantors, luminaries  of the Yiddish stage, and concert artists such as Jan  Peerce, Herschel Bernardi, Sidor Belarsky and Masha  Benya, Seymour Rechzeit and Miriam Kressyn. Their  approach grows out of earlier efforts in Europe, Palestine,  and the United States to create art music based on Jewish  sources. Lazar Weiner was a living link to the East  European concertizing tradition. Born in Kiev in 1897,  Weiner came to New York when he was seventeen.91 His  settings of Yiddish folk song, whether he arranged them  for chorus or accompanied them on piano, elevated these  songs to the level of classical music. His approach was  consistent with the efforts of Jewish composers in St.  Petersburg at the turn of the century to use Yiddish folk  song as the basis for creating a Jewish national music.   Simple Noise  Sensitivity to musical hierarchy also informs the  instrumental tradition, not only historically, as Loeffler  shows in his discussion of the stigma associated with the  term klezmer, but also within certain sectors of the  klezmer revival today. According to the liner notes for his  1977 album, Giora Feidman \"took an ancient art of the  Klezmer, an unschooled, Eastern European Jewish  musician, from the folklore plateau of amateurism and  elevated it to artistic heights, amazingly sophisticated,  profound in style and virtuosic eclat.\"92 This is a long  way from the avant-gardism of a John Zorn, who  considers all music equal--\"there's no high art and low  art.\" And, for that matter, from the ethos of the folk song  revival, which turned the hierarchy upside-down, but did  not get rid of it.  Inclusive as the folk song revival was, it could not  find a place for the Jewish instrumental tradition. Why  not? Clues may be found in debates over the definition of  folk song, the aesthetic of simple noise, and the  celebration of amateurism. Above all, for the revivalists,  folk song did not require elevation. On the contrary,  adorned performance was a statement in its own right, a  critique of the exclusive culture of classical music. There  was still a musical hierarchy, but in reverse. \"Low\" music  was good just as it was and maybe even better than \"high\"  music.   Reacting to the idea that folk song needed to be  dressed up for the concert stage, performers such as  Theodore Bikel brought an unvarnished voice, self-taught  guitar, international repertoire, and entertaining spiel to  their performance of folk song. Musical virtuosity was not  the point. Of his own abilities as a folk singer Oscar  Brand wrote in a playfully self-effacing tone, \"I even  learned to play the guitar in order to cover my vocal  deficiencies.\"93 A Canadian Jew who moved to the  United States, Brand began performing professionally  after leaving the United States Army in 1945. He can still  be heard today on WNYC 840/AM (Saturday, 7:00 p.m.),  where he hosts \"Folksong Festival with Oscar Brand.\"   In his 1962 account of the \"tidal wave of folk  singing,\" Brand defines the folk song in terms of sound,  what he calls \"simple noise,\" not provenance.94 Though  oral transmission will gradually wear away \"the unreal,  the phony, and the unnecessary,\" the patina of an antique  musical form can be fabricated instantly by those who  know how to achieve an \"artless, unself-conscious  quality\" and \"special ring of truth\" in their compositions  and performances.95 The locus classicus of \"simple  noise\" is the Anglo-American ballad. Brand is explicit on  this point: \"I can usually recognize this simplicity when I  meet it in American and Canadian song, but I find myself  less sure when I encounter the folk music of foreign lands.  I can humbly confess that most Chinese songs sound alike  to me. And the difference between a Kirghiz art song and  a Kirghiz folk song is beyond my comprehension.\"96  Several generations later, musicians such as Walter Z.  Feldman would be able not only to tell the difference, but  also to perform the music.  With its emphasis on storytelling, rather than  virtuosic musicianship, the ballad was considered a song  anyone could sing. The ethos of participation was so  strong that Professor Robert J. Potter, whom Brand  quotes, insisted that \"Folk music by its very nature doesn't  make perfectionist demands with respect to performance,  but is in some ways even 'better' if it is not perfect-- imperfection makes it more folksy.\"97 It requires \"no  more than average ability\" or even \"less than average  ability.\" Behind this overstatement of the inclusiveness of  the folk song revival is a critique of musical exclusivity:  \"Our nation is peopled with unfortunates who were tagged  as 'listeners' by harried kindergarten teachers, and,  consequently, fear the sound of their own voices raised in  song.\"98 Judging from the surge of guitar sales, the  enormous audiences at the Newport Festivals, and the  popularity of singing along, many people did ride the  wave of folk song interest.   Brand was not alone in defining folk song by effect,  an approach that separated the purists from the  popularizers. It was not long, however, before effect was  confounded with affectation and both were subjected to  parody and criticism.99 The purists objected to an  approach that was essentially theatrical, however much it  affected the effect of simple noise. Not surprisingly,  several singers, among them Bikel, were also professional  actors. To some extent Bikel approached his international  repertoire the way a character actor approaches a role.  While audiences were responsive, key figures in the  movement such as Alan Lomax took him to task: \"Alan  never seemed comfortable with me as a folk performer,  grudgingly accepting my Hebrew, Yiddish, or Russian  songs, but little else among the twenty-one languages in  which I perform, especially any Anglo-Saxon  material.\"100 Reflecting on the time when Lomax  prevented him from performing at a folklife-award  ceremony in Washington D.C., Bikel commented, \"One  more example of the folk purist fearing contamination  from 'show biz.'\"101  The international repertoire and musical sensibility of  a Theodore Bikel was more like continental cuisine than  local cooking, and it was down-home food prepared by  native cooks that the purists were after. Bikel's  performances were highly mediated by a set of aesthetic  practices specific to the revival itself. But, so too were the  performances of an Alameda Riddle or Huddie Ledbetter,  however different those practices might be.   Fault Lines of Sensibility  The decades immediately preceding the klezmer revival  are generally viewed as a wasteland. Traditional Jewish  instrumental music fell out of favor, and the folk song and  music revivals of the period showed no interest in it.  Viewed as a lull in musical interest, little remains to be  said. Viewed as a plenum of sensibility, the period holds  clues to the klezmer revival that followed. To track the  careers of Theodore Bikel, a rising professional folk  singer, and Mickey Katz, a veteran  instrumentalist/comedian, is to trace the fault lines of  changing structures of feeling.   Born in Vienna, Bikel left for Palestine with his  family in 1938 when he was fourteen years old. His  parents, ardent Zionists, were from Czernowitz, a city in  the eastern part of the Austrian-Hungarian empire before  World War I and in Romania after the war. Bikel was  born on Theodore Herzl's birthday and was named after  him. Active in a Zionist youth movement, he learned  Hebrew songs from Zionist propaganda films in Vienna  and added to his repertoire in Palestine, where he  completed school,102 lived on a kibbutz, and acted in the  Hebrew Theater. In 1946, he moved to London, where he  studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and  pursued a career in the theater. Both in London and in  Paris, which he visited frequently, he sought out folk  music and musicians in caf\u000es and bars, particularly  Russian expatriates who played gypsy music. He also  encouraged friends and acquaintances, including key  figures in the British and American folk song revivals, to  perform at parties in his home. Before long he was singing  folk songs in public. Within days of arriving in New York  in 1954 to perform in the Broadway play Tonight in  Samarkand, he attended a Pete Seeger concert at  Columbia University and introduced himself to Seeger-- the Weavers were still blacklisted at this time and their  recordings and performances were few and far between.   Bikel quickly became a part of the revival scene.  While Jewish repertoire may not have been central to the  folk song revival, Jews certainly were. They owned and  managed clubs and record companies. They were  composers, performers, agents, and managers. They were  writers and critics. Moses Asch, son of Sholem Asch,  established Folkways. Jac Holzman and Leonard Ripley  ran Elektra. Kenneth S. Goldstein issued innumerable  recordings of songs from the field. Israel Young ran the  Folklore Center on MacDougal Street. Aliza Greenblatt,  the mother of Woody Guthrie's former wife Marjorie, was  a published Yiddish poet; she wrote Der fisher, which has  become a favorite in the Yiddish song repertoire.103 Jean  Richie's husband, George Pickow, a Jew from New York,  made her an improved mountain dulcimer.104 The list  goes on.  Bikel recorded nineteen albums for Elektra, the first  of which, Folksongs of Israel, appeared in 1955. He sang  in twenty-one languages (he did not speak all of them)  and was a gifted impersonator. As he says of himself: \"I  was a character actor and considered my craft to demand  chameleon techniques.\"105 He brought a similar approach  to his international repertoire of songs and manner of  presentation, explaining that he could \"assume authentic  accents\" but was sometimes faulted for his \"willingness to  make a song accessible and palatable to an audience  unfamiliar with the material, instead of keeping the aloof  stance of a purist.\"106  The staged images on his album covers are consistent  with his theatrical approach to folk song performance. In  his recent autobiography, Bikel explained that \"Folksongs  of Israel showed an Israeli pioneer girl walking through  fields of the Jordan Valley. She was actually a New York  model, and the fields were on Long Island.\"107  Describing the cover of his first album of Yiddish songs,  he recalls that \"It shows me leaning on a guitar in front of  a Lower East Side brick wall with a theater poster on it,  listing the songs in Yiddish, and speaking to a young  yeshiva boy. The boy looked right, but was hardly likely  ever to see the inside of a yeshiva; when I called him over  to offer him a few dollars to pose with me saying, \"Come  here, yingele [kid],\" he asked, \"?Qu\u000e quiere?\" (What do  you want?) in pure Puerto Rican.\" 108 However irreverent  the in-joke, neither the image nor the music were in-your- face, in contrast with the sensibility of some neo- klezmers.   Bikel, as well as Martha Schlamme, performed  concerts at Town Hall, were featured at Newport  Festivals, and collaborated with leading revivalists such as  Pete Seeger and Oscar Brand. During the fifties, they not  only included Jewish songs on records with titles like  Folk Songs From Just About Everywhere (Bikel) and  Songs of Many Lands (Schlamme), but also issued  records devoted exclusively to what they called Jewish  folk songs. (When klezmer bands list the wide range of  what they play--the Mike Eisenstadt Band declares \"Our  speciality is anything!\"--they mean musical and  performance style and not just repertoire.)109  Schlamme, who spent her early years in Vienna, was  a classically trained soprano. She favored orchestral  accompaniment or flute and piano for her Yiddish,  Hebrew, and international songs. Shortly before her death,  she performed Yiddish songs with David Krakauer.  Though Bikel generally accompanied himself on guitar,  he also performed with orchestras and bands--Bill Lee, the  father of film maker Spike Lee, accompanied him on bass  and traveled with him on a concert tour through the South  during the sixties. If Bikel popularized a folk sound and  Schlamme concertized, Ruth Rubin was the purist. She  focused exclusively on Yiddish folk songs, which she  collected from oral tradition. Rubin performed these songs  a cappella, recorded them for Folkways, and presented her  extensive research in songbooks, published as early as  1950, and in Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish  Folk Song, which first appeared in 1963.110  These performers located the Jewishness of their  material in song and specifically in melodies and words.  Given that Yiddish folk song is a largely a cappella  tradition, what were singers headed for the stage to do?  Purists like Rubin simply performed them without  accompaniment. Not surprisingly, she was the most  attentive to the traditional vocal styles of those from  whom she collected the songs. Bikel's style owed more to  the Parisian caf\u000e and Greenwich Village coffee house,  where he learned much of his repertoire. He was more  inclined to learn songs from other professional singers and  to use instrumental accompaniment. In this way,  revivalists integrated the songs into an international  repertoire suitable for concert stage and hootenanny alike.  A constitutive feature of this approach was precisely the  recognition that the song (words and tunes) did not  emanate from the same source as the performance (vocal  style, setting, arrangement, accompaniment). The result  was not the eclectic fusions we see in the klezmer revival  or the incongruous juxtapositions of parodies of the  period, but the sounds of the revival itself.  The singers of Jewish repertoire that we remember  from this period were solo vocalists, with or without  accompaniment, not ensembles. Despite the popularity of  these performers, Yiddish folk song remained one of the  most vulnerable genres in the Jewish musical repertoire. It  had already begun the process of becoming \"heritage\"  during the late nineteenth century, if not earlier, with  efforts to collect, record, and arrange it for artistic  performance. Needless to say, few klezmer performers  today grew up speaking Yiddish, the sine qua non of the a  cappella Yiddish folk song tradition. While training in  classical music and jazz, and experience playing Balkan  and Appalachian traditional music, may have prepared  them for klezmer music, those who choose to sing must  also master enough Yiddish for the task. Interestingly,  more than one klezmer revival musician has characterized  the musical instrument, particularly the clarinet, as a  human voice, and the music itself as a language. David  Krakauer has said, \"I realized that klezmer music was the  Yiddish language in music\" and hears in it \"the sound and  inflection of my grandmother's very heavily, Yiddish- tinged English.\"111 For Alicia Svigals, klezmer is \"a  musical abstraction of the Yiddish language, and it simply  sounds 'Jewish' to our ears.\"112   Performing Obsolescence  As Benjamin Botkin has noted, \"Every revival contains  within itself the seed not only of its own destruction (in  our mass entertainment the destruction proceeds from  repetition and dullness as much as from catering to the  lowest common denominator) but also of the new  revivals.\"113 An indication that a revival (or other kind of  musical movement) has run its course is parody. The  Jewish music identified with Bikel became a prime target.  Allan Sherman's album My Son, the Folk Singer (1962)  was so funny and insightful, according to Richard  Gehman, that it was sure to \"send Theo Bikel into another  line of work.\"114 A year earlier, Bob Dylan had launched  an attack on the kind of music identified with Bikel when  he performed \"Talkin' Hava Negeilah Blues,\" which one  critic characterized as mocking \"the quintessential  American Jewish tune\"--it is the one Jewish tune that  David Krakauer can remember hearing when he was  growing up. Dylan's version was \"an epitaph for the  Hebrew folk songs sung by folk singers like Theodore  Bikel and the Weavers as a vaguely leftist, working-man's  ethnic repertoire. The mockery was prescient: The left  would not be strumming love songs about Israeli soldiers  much longer. Dylan, with his inspired instinct for the  authentic, was first to smell the phonies.\"115 So could Al  Capp, \"who introduced a new character into his widely  syndicated comic strip 'Little Abner' named 'Joanie  Phonie',\" based on Joan Baez.116  Some of the first neo-klezmers shared this sensibility.  NAMA Orchestra, based in Los Angeles, explained on  their 1978 album, Mazltov!, that what made their music  special and rare was precisely its departure from \"existing  records of Yiddish songs [which] tend to feature either  operatically trained vocalists accompanied by symphony  orchestras, or folk singers with a guitar.\"117 Unlike them,  NAMA's Pearl Rottenberg \"sings in a strong natural  voice, accompanied a small folk orchestra, such as might  have been found in the villages of Eastern Europe.\" The  term klezmer does not appear. The Jewish numbers are  part of the band's repertoire of largely Balkan folk music.  While Allan Sherman and Bob Dylan were quick to  parody the Jewish music they identified with Bikel, it  could be said that Bikel and Schlamme marked out a place  for Jewish music within an international folk music scene,  a place that would later be filled by klezmer music. So too  did the parodies. Parody is an integral part of the heritage  complex, a \"museum\" in its own right. The Jewish  parodists, not the revivalists, were the ones in the fifties  and sixties to compose new material and set  Jewish/Yiddish lyrics to popular tunes. At the same time,  they recognized that they were working with \"heritage  music.\" The cover for Mickey Katz Plays Music for  Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and Brisses shows Katz \"sitting  in a baby carriage, presumably after my own bris,  smoking a cigar.\" However, this was not a comedy album,  but strictly a recording of instrumental numbers. Recalling  the late forties and fifties when he cut the English-Yiddish  comedy records for which he is so vividly remembered,  Katz said of this album, his second for Capitol, \"Every  note of the album breathes the flavor of the old but little- known happy Jewish music of the old country, yet all the  tunes are original.118 Parody also anticipates the  irreverence and eclecticism that would become hallmarks  of the klezmer revival.   The mapping of sensibility in this period--serious  music was respectful, irreverent music was comic--was  upturned as some of the new klezmers took irreverence  seriously. They produced not the Shtetl Lite of Fiddler on  the Roof, but what has been called Heavy Shtetl or \"the  new, in-your-face Jewish music.\"119 They and their fans  relished the mischief of Don Byron's performances of  Mickey Katz's music and the Klezmer Madness of David  Krakauer. The promotional copy on The Klezmorim's  Metropolis album positively describes their models as  musicians who \"played like demons,\" stirred \"dancers to a  frenzy,\" and exhibited a style \"full of unorthodox  tonalities and \"crazily-interlocking rhythms--the  rollicking, vodka-soaked sound of a steam calliope gone  mad.\" Three groups have named themselves Klezmania!  (San Francisco, Boston, and Melbourne, Australia) and a  New England high school band calls itself Klezmaniacs.   Parody is an example of what Steven Mullaney has  called a rehearsal of culture--namely, a performance that  is self-consuming in the sense that it is \"ultimately  organized around the elimination of its own pretext.\"120  As ethnographic burlesque, which has a long history and  was a tool of the Jewish Enlightenment, such parody  displays its target in extraordinary detail and makes that  display a vehicle for sensibility, which is what animates  the parody in the first place. Stempenyu, discussed by  Rothstein in this issue, is a case in point.  The Jewish wedding has long been the focus of such  treatment. A kind of primal scene of Jewish survival, the  wedding is where the promise and crisis of cultural  reproduction and biological survival get addressed both in  reverential and parodic performances of Jewish wedding  music and comic routines. Recordings of wedding  parodies were all the rage in the twenties, as Slobin has  noted, and not just among Jews.121 A comparison of  Jewish wedding parodies over time would chart a history  of changing structures of feeling from David Fr \"Gallery of Obnoxious Abuses, Shocking Customs, and  Absurd Ceremonies of the Jews,\" in Sulamit during the  early nineteenth century to Der Mesader Kedushin and Di  boyberiker khasene in the twenties to Mickey Katz's  affectionate lobs of the fifties. Seen as musical  performances of cohort awareness, these displays of  cultural connoisseurship in the breach chart the  generational structure of sensibility and its sounds.122 No  one exemplifies this moment more vividly than Mickey  Katz.  In his roles as musician, comedian, and radio host,  Katz presided over the obsolescence of what he called  \"the old but little-known happy Jewish music of the old  country.\"123 Katz, who was born in 1909, had been doing  English-Yiddish parodies of fairy tales on the radio as a  teenager in Doc Whipple's big band in Cleveland in the  twenties. But it was only in 1947, after he broke up with  Spike Jones, that Katz made English-Yiddish parody a  speciality. The Barton Brothers had brought out several  parody records, which made Katz think there might be a  market for his own routines. Jewish executives at RCA  were taken with the idea and Katz proceeded to record  parodies of current hits. The first singles by Mickey Katz  and His Kosher Jammers were, by his own account, a sell  out success: \"I had given the Jewish record-buying public  something they evidently wanted and up to now hadn't  had.\"124 There followed the Borscht Capades, with his  son Joel Grey, and a stint as a \"kosher disc jockey\" in  Southern California from 1951 to 1956.125  In addition to playing his own records, Katz's radio  show featured everything from Al Jolson's \"The  Anniversary Waltz\" and Yiddish recordings by operatic  cantors to symphonic arrangements of Jewish folk music,  songs about the Holocaust, and Israeli recordings.  Summing up the experience, Katz writes: \"The greatest  personal satisfaction I got from my radio show was its  wide appeal. Thousands of people of all faiths loved the  haimish (homey) Jewish music and the lively  frailachs.\"126 Though Katz did most of his talking in  English, the Yiddish flavor of the show and the repertoire  he featured would have appealed to an older generation.  This assumption is borne out by the jokes he tells about  his audience:  Jewish mamas and papas have always loved waltzes.  There's a wonderful story about the old couple who were  dancing in Miami Beach. In the old days all the hotels  there had \"dancing classes.\" And since it was Florida, the  dancing classes usually featured Latin music. Well, one  day our elderly couple were dancing to Pupi Campo's  band at one of the hotels, and Sam, trying to keep up with  the lively Latin rhythm, was stepping all over his wife's  feet. Finally, she said, \"Waltz a little faster, Sam; they're  playing a fox-trot.\"127  While the show's success was a vindication of sorts,  by the early fifties, Katz was finding it \"slow going.\" He  was encountering resistance to his routines. After his first  show at Slapsie Maxie's in Los Angeles, the owner- manager came to Katz's dressing room and declared,  \"There will be no Yiddish done in this club!\" and Spike  Jones suggested Katz supply a libretto for the Yiddish- challenged.128 The Jewish manager of a radio station in  Los Angeles refused to play his records. He said Katz's  records were insulting and besides, \"I don't play any  ethnic records,\" which was not the case--he did play  Mexican music.129 A Philadelphia station manager (not  Jewish) refused to play Katz's records \"Because some of  our listeners are offended. . . . I will not play any record  with Yiddish in it. Yiddish is the language of the  ghetto.\"130  Katz, in the autobiography from which I take these  accounts, attributes the hostility he encountered to shame  on the part of Jews and anti-Semitism on the part of non- Jews--he also acknowledged that not everyone in his  audience could understand Yiddish. What he does not  address is precisely what some people found so funny and  others so \"insulting\" and \"offensive\" This is a subject  worthy of a study in its own right. Suffice it to note that  Katz's parodies of incompetence were highly virtuosic.  They required a mastery not only of multiple linguistic  and musical idioms, but also of incongruous  juxtapositions.131 This art, governed by a different  sensibility, lives on in such recordings as Rechnitzer  Rejects, which were produced in the eighties.132  Katz's Yiddish humor appealed to a contracting circle  of \"insiders\" as well as to the children of Yiddish speakers  for whom just the sound of Yiddish was funny or  offensive, quite apart from the meaning of the words.  Uriel Weinreich has noted how obsolescent languages  acquire esoteric value and comic associations: \"Among  the children of American immigrants, the mere utterance  of a word in their parents' language easily evokes  laughter.\"133 Whatever status Yiddish may have had as a  primary medium of communication, it is as an obsolescent  language, a stylistic specialization, that it figures in Katz's  English-Yiddish routines. It is characteristic of  obsolescent languages that \"colorful idiomatic  expressions, difficult to translate, with strong affective  overtones, whether endearing, pejorative, or mildly  obscene\" turn up in discourse that is \"informal and  uninhibited by pretensions of high social status.\"134 Food  terms are likely to be part of the mix. (Sure enough, they  turn up today in the humorous names of neo-klezmer  bands such as Nosh, Lox & Vodka, Hot Latkes, and  Shawn's Kugel.) Setting Yiddish lyrics to a hit parade tune  intensified the comic effect.  The mixed responses to Katz's performances in the  fifties point to shifts in sensibility. During the Cold War,  Jews had good reason to be nervous. Obsolescence is one  thing, genocide is another. As early as 1943, Maurice  Samuel described The World of Sholom Aleichem as an  act of necromancy, a calling up from the dead.135 He  converted what Sholem Aleichem's nineteenth-century  readers had read as satire into elegiac ethnography. The  World of Sholom Aleichem was one of several such  treatments of a destroyed world that appeared in the  forties and fifties. Others include Bella Chagall's Burning  Lights and Heschel's The Earth Is the Lord's: The Inner  World of the Jew in Eastern Europe, both of which  appeared in Yiddish and in English translation, and Life Is  with People: The Culture of the Shtetl, the first major  ethnography of East European Jewish culture to appear in  English.136 Ambivalence about that world, an  ambivalence that informed both the immigrant experience  and the Zionist movement, was put to a severe test after  World War II. It was one thing to be ambivalent about a  way of life that posed a threat to success in America or the  establishment of a Jewish homeland. Condemning a  destroyed world to oblivion was another matter.  Evocations of a vanished world reached their apogee  in Fiddler on the Roof (1964), which, together with Marc  Chagall's imagery, made the klezmer the icon of an  irretrievable world--and, from then on, albums of Yiddish  song often included songs from this popular musical.  However sentimental such elegies may seem to us today,  they attempted to deal with what came to be known as the  Holocaust before it was possible to deal directly with the  genocide. In a period where memory vacillated between  sad nostalgia and outraged horror, hope attached itself to  establishing a Jewish homeland and creating a new life  there or elsewhere.  No wonder Mickey Katz had a difficult time finding  a niche for his English-Yiddish parodies. They spoke to  the experience of an earlier generation of immigrants,  those who had come far enough to be able to laugh at the  \"incompetence\" Katz performed with such virtuosity. That  experience had become irrelevant, if not embarrassing, to  a suburbanized generation of respectable Jews. The  Yiddishists of the Yiddish day schools and summer  camps, Workman's Circle, and YIVO Institute for Jewish  Research considered Borscht Belt culture vulgar. It was a  threat to the Yiddish civilization for whose very survival  they fought. As for the newest Yiddish speakers to arrive  on the scene, a young generation of refugees and  survivors, what were they to make of Katz's parodies. In  the wake of the Holocaust, those routines had become an  irreverent tombstone, a sacrilege, an affront to changed  sensibilities. In the fifties, Bikel could write obscene  graffiti on the record cover of his first album of Yiddish  folk songs. Forty years later he would begin his  autobiography with the Holocaust, not with his birth, and  write of his own narrow escape, \"Maybe I was meant to  use my voice as a warning that history must not repeat  itself.\"137   The Jewish Space  Since the Holocaust, there have appeared innumerable  evocations of \"vanished communities,\" eleventh-hour  documentaries of the \"last Jews\" of Eastern Europe, and  increasingly, Holocaust memorials. Those memorials,  seen historically, also reflect shifts in sensibility,  particularly as the children of survivors find their own  voices. Art Spiegelman's Maus is but one example of what  Gilad Melzer calls irreverent memory. He considers the  problem of representing the Holocaust \"properly\" in  relation to new generational sensibilities and the  \"Holocaust rock music\" of such Israeli musicians as  Yehuda Poliker.138 Today, Central and Eastern Europe  are no longer the nowhere of an evacuated Yiddishland.  Not only is there a modest renewal of Jewish life and  communities and a major influx of Jewish tourists, but  also \"the 'Jewish space' in Europe . . . is increasingly  attracting non-Jews,\" in the words of historian Diana  Pinto.139 They are the primary audience in Europe for  klezmer music, particularly as performed by American  Jewish musicians, but also by bands with names like  Klezgoyim. In the estimation of Alan Bern, the virtuosic  accordionist in Brave Old World, some non-Jewish  musicians perform klezmer music \"better than Jewish  musicians who count as leaders of the revival.\"140 If, as  Liberman declared, old-time klezmorim \"bridged the  cultural abyss between the ghetto and the world,\" the neo- klezmers are filling a new kind of Jewish space, no less  imagined than the topoi of ghetto and shtetl.141  A hero of the contemporary European klezmer scene  is Giora Feidman. While the San Francisco Klezmorim  are generally credited with being the first to record neo- klezmer music, in 1977, Feidman debuted his Jewish  \"soul music\" in 1972 and issued his first klezmer album in  1973. \"King of Klezmer in the world today,\" Feidman  bases the purity of his performances of klezmer music not  on scrupulous attention to reconstruction but to distilling  the \"essence\" of what he calls \"Jewish soul music.\"142  Born of a romantic mysticism, his etherial musical  interpretations depend more on inspiration than fidelity to  an authoritative musical \"text.\" The preciousness of his  performances is better suited to the concert stage and  movie soundtrack, than to the dance floor or downtown  club. While his fans embrace his music as a \"universal  language\" and medium of international brotherhood, his  critics object to his rarefied treatment of an earthy musical  idiom. They object to his sensibility; liner notes for his  early albums refer to \"Jewish Folk Music\" and \"little  worlds\" (among them Fiddler on the Roof and  contemporary Israel) and his repertoire draws from film  scores as well as Hasidic Music Festivals and the music of  Middle Eastern Jewish communities living in Israel.  \"Maestro Feidman,\" as he is referred to on his albums  and on The Giora Feidman Home Page, is not of the same  cohort as the American neo-klezmers. Born in Argentina,  Feidman immigrated to Israel in 1957 to accept the  invitation to join the clarinet section of the Israel  Philharmonic Orchestra. While he describes himself as a  fourth-generation klezmer, it is precisely this yikhes (and  his extraordinary talent as a classical musician) that  authorizes his distillations and the bold claims he makes  for them. His largest followings are in Germany and  Israel, where relationships to the East European Jewish  past are particularly fraught, whether as the legacy of  Nazism or Zionism.  Groups like the Klezmer-Gesellschaft e.V, founded  in Berlin in 1990 and their Klezmer Orchestra, established  in 1995, are attracted to Feidman's celebration of klezmer  music's universality because it gives them \"permission\"  not only to play the music, but also to claim it:  klezmorim, they explain, \"usually were Jewish, but not  necessarily. They usually played at Jewish celebrations-- but not only. And that was why they integrated into their  repertoire the traditional music of their surroundings. The  style of playing and the repertoire are characterized by  both the tradition, vivid modifications, and new  perceptions. That is exactly, what we now call klezmer  music.\"143 The Klezmer-Gesellschaft was founded by  musicians who took Feidman's workshops and Feidman is  also a member of the society. He is an active teacher and  has issued numerous instructional recordings and books.  In the United States, Balkanarama has created a slot  for klezmer music in a list that includes Albania, Bosnia,  Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia,  Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, and The Roma (Gypsies). The  topos of music as place, a site of imagined community,  can be found in the instruction, \"Welcome to the Republic  of Balkanarama. Please surrender your passport at this  time.\"144 The place is then--a dreamy chronotope of  Jewish gypsies, fiddling their way from place to place,  picking up the sounds around them, and fusing them into  a zany foot-tapping musical icon pierced by the soulful  cry of a fiddle or clarinet.145 The place is not now.   Moreover, the music, once it has been universalized,  is no longer even Jewish--\"Klezmer is not Jewish music,\"  Feidman has said, explaining that \"Everyone is born a  singer. God gave to us an instrument of song, our body.  This is klezmer.\"146 Nothing could be further from the  sensibility of American neo-klezmers. Or, from those who  remember hearing the old-timers, some of whom were  young at the time and alternated playing Jewish and jazz  gigs. The \"indigenous music\" of klezmorim, which Nat  Hentoff defined as \"improvising Yiddish musicians,\"  reminded him of jazz, but with a critical difference: \"the  cadences, the timbres, the swirling rhythms went back to  far different places and times than the jazz I also loved. It  was more from these sounds than from any reading that  my sense of the old country first began to be vivid.\"147 If  the music took Nat Hentoff back to Minsk and Pinsk and  offered David Krakauer a \"musical home,\" it lets Don  Byron \"take you to a place you may have avoided and  make you feel comfortable there.\"148 That place is out. It  is on the edge. It is radical in the contradictory senses of  rooted and extreme. Such are the fault lines of sensibility  defined by klezmer music of the nineties.

Vol. 47, no. 1 (Winter 1998), special issues on klezmer  music, pp. 49-788.  ------------------  Sounds of Sensibility  Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett  Today's klezmer scene, while it affirms a degree of  musical continuity with the past, is in fact the result of an  experience of rupture. Reviewing The Klezmorim's first  album, East Side Wedding, in 1977, Nat Hentoff  commented that \"For years now, I had thought the  klezmorim to be nearly extinct. Oh, some old players  must still be boldly wailing in some dwindling Orthodox  Jewish neighborhoods, but surely they are the last of their  line.\" When he heard them, he \"would close his eyes and  grin at the ghosts of my clan in Minsk and Pinsk.\" Now,  he continued, a new generation has \"taken up and merrily  revivified this heritage.\"1 At the time, Hentoff heard the  past. Years later, Lev Liberman, who co-founded The  Klezmorim in 1975, would look back and see harbingers  of the future: \"I'd like to think that the current klezmer  revival had its origins in our early experiments with tight  ensemble playing, improvisation, klezmer/jazz fusions,  neo-klezmer composition, street music, world beat, and  New Vaudeville.\"2   In the hiatus between the old and the new players can  be found keys to changes of sensibility that have made  today's scene possible. Whatever their ostensible subject,  the essays in this issue sound the sensibilities specific to  the klezmer phenomenon of the last twenty-five years.  They show \"klezmer music\" to be a powerful index of  what Raymond Williams has called changing structures of  feeling. Williams distinguishes feeling (\"meanings and  values as they are actively lived and felt\") from ideology  (\"formally held and systematic beliefs\"), noting that they  are of course interrelated in practice: \"Methodologically,  then, a 'structure of feeling' is a cultural hypothesis,  actually derived from attempts to understand such  elements [affective elements of consciousness and  relationships] and their connection in a generation or  period, and needing always to be returned, interactively,  to such evidence.\"3 The essays gathered here provide rich  evidence of just such \"affective elements of  consciousness\" and their historical location.  My essay explores the historical formation of the  klezmer phenomenon in terms of changing structures of  feeling. I begin by considering arguments over  terminology--not only the term klezmer, but also the word  revival--and how these debates situate klezmer music  within a larger musical landscape. I then relate the  klezmer phenomenon to what Haim Soloveitchik has  called the end of self-evident Jewishness.4 While  stringent orthodoxy is one outcome of the tension between  tradition and ideology, the klezmer revival is another.  There follows an analysis of the fault lines of sensibility  in the period immediately preceding the klezmer revival.  While the popularity of old-time Jewish wedding music  declined and an incipient heritage orientation to it can be  detected within the Jewish music world of the time, this  music was notably absent from the folk song and music  revivals of the fifties and sixties. To better understand this  absence, I contrast the musical sensibilities of Theodore  Bikel, an international folk singer who specialized in  Yiddish, Hebrew, and Russian songs, and Mickey Katz,  who performed English-Yiddish comedy and musical  parodies for a largely Jewish audience. Seen not as a  musical wasteland, but as a plenum of shifting  sensibilities, the fifties and sixties hold clues to the  emergence of the klezmer revival in the seventies, its  efflorescence in the nineties, and its changing character in  the United States and in the \"Jewish space\" of Europe  today.5    The Klezmer Phenomenon  What to call this scene and how to characterize the music  are matters of ongoing debate. As Williams writes of  keywords more generally, the term klezmer is tangled up  with the phenomenon it is being used to discuss.6 While  klezmer music, klezmer musicians, and klezmer revival  are commonly heard terms, Andy Statman recently said  that the music he plays is not klezmer but Hasidic, and  Giora Feidman has declared that \"Klezmer is not Jewish  music.\"7 Some take issue with the term revival. Vurma  Klezmer Orkester, a young Swedish band, insist on two  revivals, not one, and see themselves as part of the  \"second renaissance\" of the music, the first one having  occurred in the late seventies.8 Others reject the term  revival. Either they argue that Jewish instrumental music  never \"died\" or they insist that what today's musicians are  doing is not revival, but something utterly contemporary.   Most would agree with Frank London, in his essay in  this issue, that \"klezmer . . . has gone from an underused  term to being overgeneralized.\" In 1981, before klezmer  music was an established category, the jacket for The  Klezmorim Metropolis carried the following instruction:  \"File under: Folk or Jazz.\"9 Since then klezmer music has  become not only an identifiable genre, but also a highly  differentiated phenomenon. It is now not possible to speak  generally of a klezmer revival, a klezmer scene, or a  Jewish music scene as if there was a single entity.  \"Klezmer\" or \"klez\" (it is not even necessary to specify  \"music\") circulates within a vast musical landscape. Part  of the success of the music in today's popular music  market stems from the strategic placement of the music.  As Joel Lewis notes in his review of a Klezmatics concert  in 1995, they play \"the Ashkenazic Jewish folk music  known as klezmer\" but \"have a broad enough appeal to fit  equally into the programs of folk, jazz and world music  festivals.\"10 They aren't \"trapped inside a musical  'shtetl.'\"11  Not only is klezmer one of several kinds of Jewish  music on a Sunday morning music show that features  \"Israeli/Jewish/Klezmer/Yiddish\" music,12 Klezmer has  also become a kind of \"world music.\" The Klezmatics  describes itself as \"the planet's radical Jewish roots band,\"  Klezmos plays \"World Klez music,\" and Rubinchik's  Orkestyr features \"Old-World Beat\" (a pun on Old World  and world beat).13 The music of Brave Old World has  been described as \"world-Jewish.\" Ben Brussell identifies  the format of Klezmania! (San Francisco) as \"definitive  world music.\" In order to tell the many klezmer bands  apart, musicians and critics identify ever more eclectic  and specific musical alignments and orientations. The  Cayuga Klezmer Revival band characterizes its style  variously as \"folk/roots/electric/acoustic/\" and \"jazz, rock,  swing, folk ska, and reggae\" and identifies its repertoire as  \"a mixture of traditional Eastern-European tunes, Ladino,  Israeli, and original tunes.\"14 The British group Souls of  Fire performs \"klezmer-roots-worldbeat-dance.\" HaLaila  calls its music \"tribal Jewish funk, or depending on our  mood, 'acid klez.'\"   Objections to the term notwithstanding, \"revival\"  speaks to a rupture of cultural transmission in postwar  America. During the early fifties, while playing in Las  Vegas, Mickey Katz was approached by a Texan who  asked him to play some \"Jew music\": \"I haven't heard me  a good frailach since my bar mitzvah down in Waco,\" the  Texan explained. Katz complied and \"played him some  Jewish jazz.\"15 By the seventies, the \"Texan Hebrew\"  would have been able to hear those freylekhs again and  then some. During the intervening years, however, many  stellar performers of the music he remembers from his bar  mitzvah party were no longer active or had passed away.  Nor had the music been enshrined as heritage in the way  that many other musics were.16 Indeed, performers like  Henry Sapoznik came to the Jewish instrumental tradition  through other heritage musics, in his case Appalachian,  while others started from Balkan heritage music. As  Robert Cantwell has argued, \"many kinds of music that at  other periods had been commercially performed and  recorded, such as blues, old-time, and bluegrass music-- music of chiefly southern or southeastern rural origin-- came to be regarded as folk music and enjoyed a revival  on that basis, to be followed in the next decade by Irish  ceili, Klezmer, and other ethnic musics.\"17 It was only a  matter of time, in Hankus Netsky's view, before Jewish  instrumental music would reemerge: \"Archaic things  come back. . . . The blues came back. . . . And the same  thing eventually happened when our generation came of  age and said, 'Wait a minute. What happened? Where's  our folk music?'\"18  Sapoznik's now legendary account of his career is a  vivid case in point. While the Texan Jew would fondly  remember the \"Jew music\" of his bar mitzvah in the  thirties, Sapoznik remembers hating the music at his bar  mitzvah in the sixties:  My parents had hired one of the top New York City  klezmer clarinetists to play at the reception. So there he  was on the bandstand blowing some of the best bulgars in  the business and all I wanted to do was to crawl into the  nearest, deepest hole.  \"Can't this guy play anything modern?\" the bar  mitzvah kvetshed. At that point all my life had been spent  in the presence of this music. I made no distinction  between the hasidic nigunim we sang on the schoolbus  going to Lubavitch yeshiva or the klezmer and Yiddish  music ubiquitously heard at the Catskill hotels where we  sang during Passover. I thought everybody had a cantor  father who wandered around the house softly humming  the High Holidays liturgy to himself.19  Sapoznik's parents had paid for klezmer, but he  wanted rock'n'roll. His sense of rupture pointed not to the  music but to interest in it: \"The music was patiently  waiting for us to hear it again.\" Meanwhile, Sapoznik  played rock'n'roll, made his way through the folk song  revival (Woody Guthrie, Cisco Houston, Bob Dylan), and  \"soon found myself getting into more traditional kinds of  music: Irish, New England Contradances, but mainly  Appalachian string band music.\" In the mid-seventies,  Sapoznik was visiting Tommy Jarrell, a senior Southern  string musician, when Jarrell, observing that many Jews  were interested in old-time music, asked Sapoznik:  \"Hank, don't your people got none of your own music?\"  Sapoznik was stunned. He headed back to New York,  consulted with his grandfather, who was the same age as  Jarrell, and began the search for his \"own music.\"20  I use the term \"heritage music\" to distinguish  between music that is part and parcel of a way of life and  music that has been singled out for preservation,  protection, enshrinement, and revival--in a word, heritage  music. Heritage music, as it emerges from Hentoff's  account of hearing The Klezmorim for the first time,  verges on necromancy--literally a conjuring up of the  dead. \"Heritage,\" as I have argued elsewhere, is a mode of  cultural production that gives the disappearing and gone a  second life as an exhibit of itself.21 In 1977, Hentoff  wrote of a new generation of musicians revivifying-- literally, giving new life to--a nearly extinct musical  \"heritage.\" At the same time, he distanced himself from  \"heritage\" when he conceded that although Liberman was  \"director of music and arts at the Judah Magnes Museum  in Berkeley, California . . . he and his colleagues do not  play as if they are in a museum.\"22   It is significant, however, that two pioneering  klezmer figures, Liberman and Sapoznik, found support  for their early efforts in the context of Jewish arts  institutions--Sapoznik was project director of the Jewish  music research project at the Martin Steinberg Center for  Jewish Arts of the American Jewish Congress from 1977  to 1979, thanks to government support in the form of  SETA grants. This is the period during which folk arts  became recognized as a division or funding category or  priority within government agencies such as the National  Endowment for the Arts (1974), the New York State  Council for the Arts (1980), and the American Folklife  Center at the Library of Congress (1976). The  Smithsonian Institution, which had established the  American Folklife Festival in 1967, featured Jews at their  bicentennial festival in 1976.23 Situated in these agencies  and in state arts councils, professionally trained folklorists  and ethnomusicologists curated, evaluated, and otherwise  guided increasingly sophisticated heritage programs in the  public sector. The Klezmer Conservatory Band was  incubated at the New England Conservatory of Music in  Boston, where Hankus Netsky taught and eventually  chaired the Jazz Studies department.  Almost twenty years later, Seth Rogovoy, who is  writing a book on the klezmer revival, would praise the  \"downtown jazz artists who don't approach it [klezmer  music] as a fossilized object of ethnomusicological  interest but as a living form worthy of updating and  experimentation.\"24 The formulation \"living form\" is less  an affirmation of continuity than a statement of aesthetic  orientation. It suggests a musical point of departure rather  than an historical destination.   The klezmer revival accommodates not only  historical and aesthetic orientations, but also religious  ones. Describing a recent concert by the David Krakauer  Trio, Rogovoy writes that \"A standing-room-only crowd  jammed the pews and aisles of St. James Church on  Tuesday night to worship at the altar of klezmer.\"25 As a  metaphor for the enthusiasm of fans, \"worship at the altar  of klezmer\" suggests that listening to the music is (or is  like) a religious experience. Such metaphors are  reminders that the term revival has historically been  associated with religious revivals.26 Revivalist carries the  sense of renewed attention and new presentation (an  orientation to the past), while revitalist--Hasidism has  been characterized as a revitalist movement--suggests new  life or vigor (a program for the future).27 The distinction  between revivalist and revitalist tends to blur, and the  terms are sometimes used interchangeably with each  other, and with renewal. Both are often associated with  youth and countercultures, as is klezmer. While it would  be going too far to call them youth movements, Hasidism,  and for that matter the Haskala, attracted youthful  followers during the early period of their formation.  Both professional and amateur bands often  characterize the spirit of their performances in terms of a  religious experience--not the sedate murmurings of polite  synagogues but something more akin to ecstatic  possession or altered states of consciousness. The  Klezmatic's most recent album is titled Possession.28  Appropriately enough, tracks 9 through 17 are from the  score created by the Klezmatics for Tony Kushner's  adaptation of Sh. An-ski's A Dybbuk, a play about the  transmigration of a soul--Kushner himself, in the liner  notes, characterizes the music as \"so full of August  Mystery.\"29 Musicians and those who write about them  speak of madness, wildness, frenzy, hysteria, and passion.  Call it the youthful enthusiasm of devoted aficionados.  Here again there are religious connotations: the etymology  of enthusiasm is inspiration and the primary meaning of  inspiration is \"a divine influence or manifestation that  qualifies a person to receive and communicate sacred  revelation.\"30 Divine inspiration is a redundancy.   Some bands have adopted names (and record titles)  that invoke a generally spiritual or religious sensibility or  refer more specifically to Judaism or Hasidism and its  musical repertoire, to mention only Frank London's  Hasidic New Wave project, Farbrangen Fiddlers, Souls of  Fire, Thread of Blue, and Burnt Offering. Some of these  bands are associated with synagogues. Others are not. In  the case of Souls of Fire, a British band, none of the  members is Jewish. Giora Feidman, who debuted his  Jewish \"soul music\" in 1972 and his records of this music  in 1973, has used album titles such as The Dance of Joy  and The Magic of Klezmer. In claiming to distill the  essence of \"Jewish soul music\" and to universalize it,  Feidman expresses a romantic mysticism reminiscent of  the fin-de-si\u000fcle Orientalism of Martin Buber and his  circle.31 Since his religious awakening, Andy Statman  insists that what is now called klezmer music was always  religiously mandated and cites its role in the fulfillment of  the mitzvah of simkhe on the occasion of a wedding. This  is the reason he gives for calling the music he plays today  Hasidic, rather than klezmer, though one critic has  characterized it as \"a sort of Jewish/new-age fusion.\"32   Arguments over what to call the phenomenon and  how to characterize the music were once dominated by the  experience of rupture and recovery. The debates have  intensified and their character has changed as the musical  formation called (or not called) klezmer expands,  diversifies, and matures.   Heritage, Tradition, Orthodoxy  To better understand the terms of these debates, the  musical practices with which they are associated, and the  historical processes of their unfolding, I will explore three  distinctions: feeling and ideology (Raymond Williams),  tradition and ideology (Haim Soloveichik), and tradition  and heritage. \"Tradition,\" the opening number of Fiddler  on the Roof, performs the distinction between tradition  and heritage simply by making such a fuss over what is  otherwise taken for granted. \"Tradition\" can no longer be  assumed because it is under attack. When all is said and  done Fiddler on the Roof is a performance of heritage, not  tradition, because the Broadway musical offers the  disappearing and gone a second life as an exhibition of  itself. Heritage is coded at every level--diegesis (the  narrative), mimesis (the representation), and the  performance artifact itself.  Fiddler on the Roof is also a long way from  contemporary orthodoxy, which Soloveitchik  distinguishes from tradition. Though he focuses on the  transformation of contemporary orthodoxy, his distinction  between tradition and orthodoxy is relevant to a  consideration of the klezmer phenomenon. \"A traditional  society has been transformed into an orthodox one\" when  what was a matter of course (what was once absorbed and  habitual) has become subject to rules, formal teaching,  and scrupulous attention to textual authority.33 The result  is not \"heritage,\" but a tendency toward stringency  (humra).34 As a result, \"performance is no longer, as in a  traditional society, replication of what one has seen, but  implementation of what one knows.\"35 This trend started  in the mid-fifties \"and by the mid-seventies was well on  its way to being, if it had not already become, the  dominant mode of religiosity.\"36 The result is what he  calls \"a performative spirituality, not unlike that of the  arts, with all its unabating tension.\"37  Soloveitchik uses an explicitly musical metaphor,  \"For spiritual life is an attempt, as a great pianist once put  it, to play music that is better than it can be played.\"38  Applied to klezmer music, the humra principle is most  clearly expressed by Austrian-based Budowitz, an  \"ensemble of Klezmer veterans performing early Jewish  repertoire and style on historical instruments.\"39 Taking  their cue from the early music movement, they perform  music that critics have described as \"Very pure. The kind  of music that enthralled Bartok and Kodaly.\"40  The shift that Soloveitchik describes--\"the aspiration  will be . . . more to purity of ideology than of impulse--is  precisely the distinction that Williams makes between  ideology and feeling.41 Gone is the yidishkayt that was  \"something deep in the bone,\" a Judaism whose essence  \"lay not in law or ritual, but in a social vision (yoysher)  and a moral standard of conduct (mentshlikhkeyt).\"42 He  attributes the end of \"self-evident Jewishness\" to a  \"rupture in the traditional religious sensibilities\" once  rooted in what he calls the mimetic society.43   Stringent orthodoxy is not the only response to the  end of \"self-evident\" Jewishness, though it could be said  that what counts as self-evident Jewishness has come to  an end more than once. What I have been calling heritage- -and klezmer music is in many ways a case in point--is a  second outcome. Historians of European popular culture  such as Peter Burke and E. P. Thompson have argued that  pressures on \"customary consciousness and customary  usages\" prompt the emergence of \"folklore\" at emerging  divides between high and low culture, as the upper ranks  collect \"folklore\" from the lower ranks.44 When the  Haskala applied pressure on customary consciousness and  practices, Jewish folklore emerged from the outtakes of  reform.45 What had been rejected as tradition would  eventually be embraced as heritage.   An ideological relationship to tradition among  haredim as well as among the new klezmers arises from a  ruptured past that \"gave them free reign to create a  familiar past of which the present was simply an  extension.\"46 On their first album, East Side Wedding  (1977), The Klezmorim explained that \"To rediscover the  unashamed passion and hysteria of authentic Jewish  music, you have to journey to the limits of living  memory,\" which they identified with the period of mass  immigration and \"neglected manuscripts and forgotten 78  rpm recordings.\"47 On their 1981 album, The Klezmorim  Metropolis, they declared, \"We are The Klezmorim. We  play klezmer music. It's been underground for fifty years.  Now it's back.\"48 Frank London has noted that The  Klezmorim \"never once mentioned Jews or being Jews. It  was just klezmer, klezmer, klezmer\" and added in a later  interview, \"For years, many of the klezmer bands hid  behind the word 'klezmer' as a way of avoiding the  'Jewish' word.\"49 This is an astute observation.   The word Jewish does appear on The Klezmorim's  first album, but strictly in an historical context. The  \"Jewishness\" of their project is carried instead by the  word Yiddish and the prominence of Yiddish terms, song  titles, and lyrics. They are klezmers by affinity, rather  than by descent or Jewish identification. Where bloodlines  are absent--Hankus Netsky, Judy Bressler, Henry  Sapoznik, and Giora Feidman identify with Jewish  instrumentalists and Yiddish performers in their families-- affinities are invoked. Like their historical models, The  Klezmorim explain, they started out playing in small  bands, they improvise, they arrange their numbers  communally and by ear, and they take pride in never  playing a solo the same way twice.  In the absence of living models, particular  importance is accorded texts (and in the case of klezmer  music, records). Defining the relationship of  contemporary performance to past models as best they can  be reconstructed is an ongoing concern. As London  commented, \"Whenever we think we are being very now,  very new, we find out what we have done is actually very  traditional.\"50 The sense of newness in the old and  oldness in the new is also conveyed in a band name like  Brave Old World and characterizations like \"Making old- world music new.\"51 Kapelye's first album was entitled  Future and Past and carried the following dedication:  \"This album is dedicated to our families who have taught  us that our future is our Jewish past.\"52  Anachronism is a productive principle, a musical  aesthetic, which operates by unsettling temporal direction.  There is no smooth continuity from yesterday's klezmorim  to today's klezmers. There is no dramatic rupture, no  simple sequence of life, death, and rebirth, as the term  revival would imply. Instead, old and new are in a  perpetually equivocal relationship. The future precedes  the past, the new precedes the old, the revival precedes its  historical models. While klezmer revival suggests the  primacy of recovery, initially a copying of what can still  be heard on old records and from elderly musicians, \"it is  the copying that originates,\" as Clifford Geertz has so  aptly stated, even in the case of meticulous musical  reconstructions.53   Klezmer musicians have felt a need to root present  practice in a meaningful past, which is not the same as  searching for roots, though for many the two come  together. Even the term \"roots music\" conveys a sense of  rootedness, rather than an exclusive claim to a singular  origin. However much klezmer music offered clarinetist  David Krakauer a \"musical home,\" it was its fusion with  jazz that gave his compositions what one reviewer  characterized as \"a thoroughly contemporary sensibility,\"  no doubt because that fusion did not produce melting-pot  music or a soft universalism or easy affirmation of a  singular ethnic identity.54 A sense of rootedness does not  require musical monogamy.   While orthodoxy and heritage do not by any means  exhaust the possible outcomes of rupture, they do force us  to rethink any easy opposition between conservative and  radical, tradition and innovation, custom and ideology. As  Thompson notes for his period, the eighteenth and  nineteenth centuries, \"So far from having the steady  permanence suggested by the word 'tradition', custom was  a field of change and contest, an arena in which opposing  interests made conflicting claims . . . it is an arena of  conflictual elements, which requires some compelling  pressure--as, for example, nationalism or prevalent  religious orthodoxy or class consciousness--to take form  as 'system'.\"55 Not only religious orthodoxy but also the  klezmer revival have taken form as system. Indeed, the  klezmer revival is an example of what Neil Rosenberg, in  his taxonomy of music revivals, calls a named-system  revival--others include Balkan, old-time fiddling, blues,  and bluegrass.56 System in this context signals the shift  from tradition to ideology.  What can be learned in this regard from the fate of  East European Jewish instrumental music among Hasidim  and haredim in America and Israel? While an earlier  American generation considered even kosher versions of  swing and jazz \"alien to a 'Jewish rejoicing' (yidishe  simche),\" their children and grandchildren were open to  rock beat and to kosher rock, that is, to rock with  acceptable lyrics, a shift that Soloveitchik attributes to the  embourgeoisement of American-born haredim.57 Hoping  to find klezmer music still going strong and without  interruption among those who seem to hew to tradition  most vigorously, Joel Rubin turned to haredim in Israel,  the subject of his essay in this issue. He offers several  reasons for why he did not find what he expected,  including the low status of professional musicians in  haredi society and the rabbinical ban in the 1860s on  instrumental music in Eretz Israel. In other words, Rubin  found himself exploring music within a religious  community, not a music scene. This is not to say that a  religious music scene does not exist, whether here or in  Israel, but only that klezmer music as such is not its  focus.58 According to Rubin, Hasidic and haredi  communities in Israel are not part of the new klezmer  scene, though there is some musical traffic and Rubin  himself is something of a bridge between the two worlds.  Those worlds are separated by more than music.    Catalytic Ruptures  A delay in the heritage process prior to the klezmer  revival not only left Jewish party music to the vicissitudes  of sensibility, but also spared it from the very ideological  attachments, from the political and religious engagements,  that gave other forms of Jewish music and musical  practices a competitive advantage at the time. The music  of American Jewish wedding musicians faded from view  for some of the very reasons that would make it attractive  to the generation that later picked it up. No movement,  whether political or religious, had claimed this kind of  music. Israeli music was sustained by the Zionist  movement, the labor movement had its songs, mandolin  orchestras, and choral groups, and both had their youth  groups and summer camps. The synagogues had their  cantors, choirs, and schools. In contrast, professional  instrumentalists worked for a market, not a movement.  Though movements also constitute a market of sorts,  movements give precedence to ideological considerations.  To better understand why the lapse was catalytic, it is  useful to compare the turning to \"klezmer\" music during  the seventies, described by Frank London and Alicia  Svigals in their contributions to this issue, with the turning  from the \"old but little-known happy Jewish music of the  old country\" that Mickey Katz was still playing in the  fifties.59 The two moments are deeply implicated in one  another, both musically (Katz's material has made a kind  of comeback) and in terms of structures of feeling (his  stigmatized irreverence is a badge of honor for a  subsequent generation). As Don Byron explained, he was  attracted to \"the mischief in [klezmer] music\" and found  in Mickey Katz, a master of mischief: \"I tend to gravitate  to whoever is playing the trickiest, outest stuff, and that's  where I live,\" whether the music be \"klezmer, jazz, big  band, or improvisation.\"60   That the music was not previously picked up cleared  the path for receiving it in purely aesthetic terms. This is  how many musicians first became interested in it--London  is emphatic on this point. So is John Zorn. A saxophonist  and composer, Zorn curated the Radical New Jewish  Culture Festival at the Knitting Factory in New York City  in 1993, and has issued klezmer/jazz/funk fusions on his  Tzadik label. For Zorn, \"All music is on equal grounds  and there's no high art and low art.\" His compositional  approach has been described as jumping \"from style to  style the way a television picture does when a deranged  channel surfer has the remote control.\"61 The \"roots\" of  this radicalism are more likely to lie in avant-garde  aesthetics and Jewish political activism than in religious  orthodoxy or folkloric heritage, though there are  exceptions like Andy Statman.  It could be said that Statman is reconfiguring the  relationships between tradition, heritage, and orthodoxy in  his live connection to Hasidic nigunim, spiritual take on  jazz, and religious orientation to performance. Statman's  newest CD, Between Heaven & Earth: Music of the  Jewish Mystics, reclaims \"klezmer as sacred music\" and  produces \"a sort of Jewish/new-age fusion,\" according to  Rogovoy.62 As I noted earlier, Statman insists that this  music was always religiously mandated and insists that it  is Hasidic, not klezmer music. Though he calls his band  The Andy Statman Klezmer Orchestra, Statman has said,  \"I don't like to use the word 'klezmer.' It becomes very  limiting,\" a statement that hints at shifts in aesthetic and  not only religious sensibility.63   The very name of his ensemble aligns it with such  early bands as the Abe Schwartz Orchestra, Harry  Kandel's Orchestra, Art Shryer's Modern Jewish  Orchestra, rather than with the revival bands. Revivalists  are more likely to invoke other musics (Yid Vicious, The  Freilachmakers Old-Time String Band, Mazeltones,  Jumpin' Jazzy Jewish Music). Revivalists tend to display a  playful, even nostalgic, relationship to the tradition (Di  Ganeyvim, Shir Fun, Kudzu Klezmer, Take the Oy Train).  They are likely to identify with the immigrant history of  the music and musicians (Greena Kozinas, Hester Street  Troupe, and Ellis Island). And, most of all, they proudly  identify themselves and their music as klezmer, a term  that earlier generations of musicians considered an insult.  Whatever its status might have been when it was a  functioning part of East European Jewish life, as outsider  music (The Klezmorim called it \"underground music\"),  the instrumental tradition was vulnerable to a rupture in  transmission. That rupture has given shape and direction  to the new klezmer music and its various sensibilities and  ideologies. That the music was once stigmatized is an  asset for a generation committed to new forms of  radicalism like the Queer Yiddishist movement identified  by Svigals. For prominent Jewish klezmer performers like  the Klezmatics and their Jewish audiences, klezmer music  gives voice to what they call the Radical Jewish Culture  movement.   Klezmer music has become the sound of particular  forms of identification, as can be seen in Svigals's  \"Manifesto.\" Whether defined positively (queer  Yiddishism, socialist Jewish past, serious approach to the  music) or negatively (no nostalgia, no \"tourism of the  past,\" no cuteness, no apologetics, no fetishizing of  authenticity), \"the identity music of Jewish American  youth\" envisioned by Svigals articulates distinctive  sensibilities and their sounds. While the scene (actually  several interlocking scenes) has many of the features  associated with youth subcultures, as Svigals shows, it is  also intergenerational, a feature that London specially  values.  London, who is now drawn to \"the secular, social  activist Yiddish song tradition,\" did not start out that way.  Quite the opposite. Klezmer music initially captured his  interest because it is \"good, just on its own terms.\" It is  one of many kinds of music he plays. When he says of his  first experience with the music that \"It really started in the  middle of nowhere,\" he is describing what it is like to  engage with music that is literally separated from its  source.64 Recordings make it possible to circulate the  sounds of music without circulating the musicians. This  disjunction not only heightens the experience of  \"nowhere\" that London describes, but also his sense that  \"one can study and assimilate the elements of any musical  style, form, or tradition by ear,\" a legacy of the historical  avant-garde.65 This aesthetic practice is intensified by the  situation of music without memory--or, in some cases, in  spite of memory.  If London could play any kind of music then anyone  could play Jewish music--and they did, though doing so  was not so straightforward. As Don Byron explained,  \"I've played klezmer music since 1980. But it hasn't been  easy to feel entitled to play it. A white man plays world  music, and no one questions the ethnic connection. But  not too many brothers are playing music from Bulgaria. I  spent hundreds of hours transcribing Katz's records: I feel  entitled to the knowledge, entitled to participate. But what  amazes people is that I'm a black guy doing the music of  people who are supposed to be white.\"66  London says he played this music despite, not  because, of the fact that he is Jewish. Being Jewish was  actually an obstacle because his experience of growing up  with Jewish music had left him feeling that it was corny.  When he embraced klezmer music, London was also  refusing \"all the shlock, all the shmaltz, all the things  about Jewish music that never interested me, all the Israeli  music, all the Yiddish theater music, about all that  sentimentality.\" Not roots and heritage, but technical  challenge, fun, and the market drove his initial interest in  the music, much as it did his captivation with jazz.  It is precisely this disjunction--music coming out of  nowhere--that allowed London to engage klezmer music  at all. Not only had the music been detached from its  historical moorings, but his generation could come  towards it with a detached attitude, an attitude they had  willed and cultivated. \"Nowhere\" is a space of abstraction  where sounds unmoored from other times and places can  be engaged as sound for its own sake. In that place called  nowhere, musicians can play anything. They do so in the  \"theme concerts\" London describes. Jewish was a theme.  It was resolutely not an \"identity\" or \"heritage.\"   Jewish, he soon discovered, was also a \"scene\" and it  is this scene that London and Svigals speak to in their  accounts from the inside, as musicians who have been part  of it, each in their own way, for almost two decades. It is  telling that London speaks in the spatial terms of nowhere  (and scene), not in the temporal terms of revival and  heritage. David Krakauer also uses a spatial metaphor  when he says of klezmer music that \"I felt in a certain way  that I had found a kind of musical home,\" though it is not  the only place he lives.67  While he attributes the secret of the Klezmatics'  success to their being \"a great rock band--that is, they  swing hard and get people emotionally,\" Michael Dorf,  who owns the Knitting Factory, adds that \"there is  something in their music that reaches the Jewish part of  me.\"68 This statement marks the distance traveled from  the sixties, when Milton Gordon in his study of  assimilation in American life could still warn his readers  that \"the individual who engages in frequent and sustained  primary contacts across ethnic group lines, particularly  racial and religious, runs the risk of becoming what, in  sociological parlance, has been called the 'marginal  man'.\"69 Gordon's marginal man, derived from Chicago  sociologists working in the twenties and thirties (Robert  E. Park and Everett V. Stonequist), was a \"social deviant\"  on the verge of nervous breakdown. Nothing could be  further from the sensibilities informing the klezmer music  scene.   The Jewish part of Dorf is clearly not all of him. The  other part, to which he attributes the Klezmatics' success,  has helped the music travel far beyond the wedding circuit  to which Jewish instrumental music had become confined.  During the first half of this century, the music could be  heard not only at simkhes, but also at banquets and social  and political functions of various kinds, Jewish caf\u000es and  restaurants.70 By the fifties, it was most likely to be heard  at weddings and in the English-Yiddish comedy shows by  performers like Mickey Katz.   Multiple Temporalities  Emphasizing a continuity they have worked hard to  achieve in the wake of genocide and cultural  obsolescence, pioneers of the klezmer revival repeatedly  delineate the chronology of the music they have  recuperated, a process that plays memory against history  and autobiography against musical reconstruction. While  the scene has a relatively short history, less than three  decades, telling that history is integral to it. The founding  figures not only tunneled to the past through archives, but  also sought out living bridges to the music as it was once  played. They apprenticed themselves to the last exponents  of the tradition. Their acts of recuperation, preservation,  documentation, and renewal affirmed Isaac Bashevis  Singer's apothegm, \"There's a big difference between  'dead' and 'dying',\" the motto of the Boston radio program  The Yiddish Voice (WUNR, Brookline,  Massachusetts).71   The founders of the scene have a keen sense of the  peculiar temporality of the revival. Unlike subsequent  generations, which have grown up with neo-klezmer  music, the founding cohort lived through the rupture and  the recovery, an experience that heightened their historical  awareness. Short and fast, the history of the scene is  remembered in detail by those directly involved in it.  Long and slow, the history of the music that inspires it has  left spotty evidence. Those who have made the scene have  also had to excavate the music. Their sense of one is  infused with their sense of the other. While a history of  klezmer music like the one provided by Hankus Netsky is  narrated forward, from the \"beginning\" to the present, it is  understood backwards, from now to then. Younger  musicians are forming their own sense of the music's  temporality, as can be seen from the claim by Vurma,  which models itself on \"the pioneer group Klezmorim,\"  that they are part of the second renaissance of klezmer. In  an interview about ten years ago, about the time they  disbanded, Kevin Linscott of The Klezmorim discouraged  new groups from using his band's music as a model and  encouraged them to go back to historical recordings.72  \"Klezmer music,\" as it emerges from what is said and  written and from the musical practices themselves, is an  \"initial shaping concept.\"73 It bears, as Williams puts it,  the marks of its formation and its unresolved problems,  both of which tend to be taken for granted. Hankus  Netsky, in his essay in this issue, starts with the European  background, immigration, and the recordings during the  first decades of this century in the United States. He  proceeds to the decline of klezmer music in the 1930s, the  parodies of the early postwar period, the sentimentality of  Jewish music of the 1960s, and the revival that began in  the 1970s (he founded the Klezmer Conservatory Band in  1980) and blossomed in the decades following.   Memory of the revival and history of the music are  not the same thing, though they tend to converge in  accounts that reflect the experience of first generation  klezmer revivalists and those who write about them. The  founding narrative is stated in the starkest terms by  Rogovoy, for whom klezmer is a phoenix rising from its  own ashes. The music is marked \"by its refusal to die\" in  the face of two assaults--the Holocaust and assimilation.  The revival is the story of what happened to \"Old World  Klezmer,\" whose \"sonorities . . . evoked the simple joys  and sorrows of shtetl life,\" in the hands of postmodern  musicians. At the same time, he documents the nuanced  sense of klezmer history expressed by Svigals, who is  quoted as saying, \"Klezmer isn't the music of an extinct  culture. . . . As contemporary living culture--as opposed  to something extinct which has been curiously and  artificially revived--Klezmer is different than it was  twenty years ago, and still more different than it was  forty, sixty, a hundred years ago.\"74 Rather than a  bifurcated temporality--before and after the revival--a  sense of differentiated historical layers is beginning to  emerge.  As professional musicians become professional  scholars, their historical vistas expand.75 Rubin looks  beyond the United States to Israel. James Loeffler, in his  contribution to this issue, looks beyond the \"golden age\"  of the interwar recordings to the early period of mass  immigration, during which the first Jewish musician's  union in the United States was established (1889). He  opens a window on the working conditions and  performance culture of professional Jewish musicians  during this era and considers their mobility. As the  musicians discussed by Loeffler entered the larger  marketplace of music, Jewish music became even more of  a niche market and some musicians, in their rising  success, left this music (and the Jewish musicians' union)  behind.   It is during the period of mass immigration that the  Yiddish theater came into its own, musicians began  making recordings, and Yiddish folk song attracted  increasing interest from scholars, artists, and publishers.  Because these developments took place in the United  States and in Europe, they did not precede immigration,  but were coincident with it. It has been argued that the  Yiddish theater and the instrumental music tradition as we  know it from early commercial recordings flowered in the  United States--performers and repertoire flowed across  the Atlantic in both directions.76 Moreover, during the  period Loeffler considers, musicians played not only for  simkhes but also on a wide variety of political,  ceremonial, and social occasions. His account offers an  important corrective to the current image of old-time  klezmer music as strictly party music.77  Loeffler's evidence suggests that specialization was a  response to a shrinking market. As they were no longer in  demand for so wide a range of events, those musicians  who continued playing for Jewish audiences came to  depend more heavily on simkhes for their living.78 They  could do so because Jewish life-cycle celebrations-- primarily the wedding, but also the bar mitzvah--had  become so much more elaborate. Those who still  remember hearing the music before the revival associate it  almost exclusively with simkhes. Many of today's  klezmers and critics project this image of the music back  to the middle ages. Rogovoy, for example, states that  \"Strictly defined, Klezmer is the Jewish instrumental  music that was played by professional musicians in  Eastern Europe for occasions such as weddings and bar  mitzvahs--a tradition that dates back at least as far as the  Middle Ages.\"79 As for weddings, the musical  requirements were far more extensive than dance music  and still are in Hasidic communities today. During the  nineteenth century (and earlier), wedding festivities could  extend over a three-week period and require musicians  and a varied repertoire for a series of events. As for bar  mitzvahs, in Eastern Europe they were generally low-key  events, not the extravagant affairs they have become  here.80  Complementing Loeffler's consideration of the  working conditions of Jewish instrumentalists in the  United States, Robert Rothstein, in his essay in this issue,  attends to the occupational subculture of professional  Jewish instrumentalists in Eastern Europe as revealed  through their argot. He presents a little klezmer-talk from  Sholem Aleichem's novel Stempenyu. In Joachim  Neugroschel's 1979 English translation, the klezmorim  sound like a couple of jazz hipsters rapping about chicks.  The translator has substituted one musical argot (jazz) for  another (klezmer), with the assumption that his readers in  1979 would recognize the lingo. Would the translation  need to be updated for subsequent generations by  substituting rap for jazz? If yes, something would be lost,  for American exponents of the klezmer tradition not only  played jazz. Many also referred to their bulgars, doinas,  and freylakhs as Jewish jazz and many played both Jewish  dance music and jazz on the same program.   Neugroschel's translation thus captures a musical  convergence subsequent to the period represented in the  novel, but meaningful to the later history of the music and  to later readers. Many musicians have come to neo- klezmer music with formal training in classical music and  jazz, and use what they know to create such new musical  fusions as freestyle klezmer. Objections to the term  Jewish jazz notwithstanding (Sapoznik quips that if  klezmer is Jewish jazz, then jazz must be goyish klezmer),  the relationship between the two musics suggests a history  of reversals as much as revivals, with musicians moving  from klezmer to jazz and back, while keeping both in play  and creating new fusions.81   Future translations of Stempenyu may have to reckon  with a new klezmer-loshn, the argot of the revival.  Variations on the word klezmer (klez, neo-klezmer,  klezmology, and klezmeroid) pepper discussions of the  music. Band names play with even more possibilities:  Klezmania!, Klezmatics, Klezical, Klezmechaye!,  Klezmos, Klezmotones, Kleztet, KlezKanada,  Klezmeydlekh. KlezKamp is the affectionate name of the  Yiddish Folk Arts Institute established by Henry Sapoznik  in 1984. The cyberhome of klezmer information is Ari  Davidow's KlezShack. This terminology has no parallel in  Yiddish, as evidenced by entry 285 (muziker [musician])  in Nahum Stutchkoff's monumental Thesaurus of the  Yiddish Language (1950) and the 1913  \"'Klesmer'sprache\" lexicons of S. Weissenberg and Alfred  Landau.82  There is no klezmer-loshn in Di vunderlikhe  geshikhte fun r' shmelkele der klezmer, a little chapbook  published in Warsaw in 1910) about eyn yidisher klezmer  in the Prague ghetto in 1820. Reb Shmelkele, a famous  artist on the fiddle and paragon of piety, played so well  that \"men hot gekent antshlofn vern fin siskayt\" (one  could fall asleep from sweetness). He was invited to play  for the hoi polloi. Christian nobility treated him with great  honor and even sent their carriages for him. At night, in  the privacy of his home, he would play \"Al Naharot  Bavel\" (By the Waters of Babylon) with such  moralishkayt that he could rouse feeling in a stone. He  was also handsome and humble. Not surprisingly, the tone  of the chapbook is pious, not sardonic.   Note that the anonymous author specifies \"Jewish\"  klezmer, but at no point does he refer to \"klezmer\" music.  Nor does he play with ethnographic detail--there is no  musician's argot--though he does endow Reb Shmelkele's  performance with extraordinary, even divinely inspired,  power. We do not find Reb Shmelkele playing at Jewish  weddings, but at elegant balls and aristocratic mansions,  the king's court and robber's den. These locales belong  more to the world of the wonder tale than to the daily  reality of Jewish instrumentalists, though klezmorim did  perform for the nobility. While this story cannot be taken  as a baseline for the history of klezmer music, it does  reveal an historically specific musical sensibility that  values emotive effect.83 This sensibility is allied with the  sentimentality of melodrama, a popular genre of Yiddish  theater in the period and even today in the Purim plays  produced by Hasidic communities in New York.84  Klezmer music--the term, the category, the music,  the sensibility--are not only contemporary, but new.  Jewish instrumentalists before the revival characterized  their music in a variety of ways, but klezmer music was  not one of them, a point that Statman underscores when  he says his band plays Hasidic, not klezmer, music.  However, Statman had to pass through the klezmer revival  to get to Hasidic music and once he got there he has been  moving in new directions that are difficult to name.    Incipient Heritage  Albums produced in the fifties, sixties, and early seventies  not only feature the performances of active wedding  musicians, but also reveal an incipient heritage orientation  to the instrumental tradition. Wedding Dances, featuring  clarinetist Marty Levitt and his orchestra, promises  listeners \"authentic WEDDING DANCES\" and assures  them that the music on this album will be as good \"as  when he performs in person at a traditional wedding\"-- hopefully listeners would hire him and his orchestra for  their simkhes.85 Rudy Tepel's 1962 album, Chasidic  Wedding: Rudy Tepel and His Orchestra Play Dance  Melodies of Vizhnitz, Lubavich, Modzitz, Satmar,  Skulen, Mea Shearim also features the performances of an  active musician.86 Tepel claimed a repertory of over six  hundred Hasidic melodies and estimated that he had  played close to five thousand weddings in a twenty-year  period.   The liner notes, however, also suggest an emerging  preservationist sensibility. They were prepared not by  Tepel, but by the producers of the album, the husband and  wife team B.-H. Stambler, who \"have been active for the  past fifteen years [i.e., since 1947] in gathering,  preserving and creating Jewish music. They have  pioneered in recording Hasidic and Sephardic music, and  in the restoration of historic cantorial discs.\" Accordingly,  the notes tell the listener little about the musical numbers  or the Hasidic dynasties and rebbes with whom they are  identified, but a lot about each stage of the wedding  festivities, information that insiders to the tradition would  not need. Records targeted to Hasidic communities are  more likely to focus on the history of a dynasty, its rebbe,  and his melodies, and to carry the admonition \"Please do  not play this record on the Sabbath or holidays.\"87  The note for the first number on Tepel's album,  \"Shpilt, Klezmorim!,\" uses the opportunity to offer a little  disquisition on klezmorim. After describing the sorry state  of part-time amateurs in the old country, the note  continues, \"Life in the United States has made a  tremendous change: today's klezmer is a successful, well- trained musician who devotes his full time to weddings;  these in turn have become elaborately catered affairs.\"  Rudy Tepel and his orchestra are characterized, not as  klezmorim, but as \"one of today's best-known wedding  bands.\" Consistent with this characterization, Tepel's  biographical note refers to him as a musician, not a  klezmer. Tepel expresses ambivalence in his careful  distinction between the Old World amateurs (klezmer) he  disavows and the American professionals (musicians)  with whom he identifies, the noble heritage intentions of  the Stamblers notwithstanding.  The liner notes for Rejoice: Torah in Song/Wedding  in the Old Country, a collaboration of Israeli, American,  and Canadian artists, most of them classically trained,  describe Dave Tarras as \"the greatest clarinet virtuoso of  Jewish folk music,\" a designation that already suggests a  shift of consciousness--neither Levitt nor Tepel described  what they played as folk music, though Levitt did promise  the \"authentic\" wedding dances that he plays at  \"traditional\" weddings.88 Tarras himself signaled the  shift, as Mark Slobin has noted, when he titled one of his  doinas \"Wedding on Second Avenue,\" a reference to the  Yiddish theater, which often included wedding scenes.89  The wedding and its music were literally staged for the  album.   A heritage orientation is even more explicit on Adele  Margolin's album Pages of History, which featured  \"Living Torah\" on one side and \"A Wedding in the Old  Tradition\" on the other.90 Margolin, a mezzo-soprano and  product of the Yiddish Folk Schools and Jewish Teachers  Seminary, hosted a Jewish music program on WLIB and  WEVD. The arrangement on Pages of History, played by  the Hebrew Folk Ensemble, was intended to make the  music \"sound like the 'Kappelia' (Miniature orchestra)  which was the major part of the entertainment at these  small town weddings. His [Amitai Ne'man,  arranger/conductor] successful handling of the subject met  with the approval of Folklorists who have been fortunate  to hear a true Kappelia in the old country.\" We see here  the hallmarks of \"heritage music.\" The music is not only  performed but also exhibited, glossed, translated, and  authenticated by \"folklorists.\"   These recordings circulated in Jewish circles. So did  reissues of great cantorial performances and artistic  reworkings of Yiddish folk songs by cantors, luminaries  of the Yiddish stage, and concert artists such as Jan  Peerce, Herschel Bernardi, Sidor Belarsky and Masha  Benya, Seymour Rechzeit and Miriam Kressyn. Their  approach grows out of earlier efforts in Europe, Palestine,  and the United States to create art music based on Jewish  sources. Lazar Weiner was a living link to the East  European concertizing tradition. Born in Kiev in 1897,  Weiner came to New York when he was seventeen.91 His  settings of Yiddish folk song, whether he arranged them  for chorus or accompanied them on piano, elevated these  songs to the level of classical music. His approach was  consistent with the efforts of Jewish composers in St.  Petersburg at the turn of the century to use Yiddish folk  song as the basis for creating a Jewish national music.   Simple Noise  Sensitivity to musical hierarchy also informs the  instrumental tradition, not only historically, as Loeffler  shows in his discussion of the stigma associated with the  term klezmer, but also within certain sectors of the  klezmer revival today. According to the liner notes for his  1977 album, Giora Feidman \"took an ancient art of the  Klezmer, an unschooled, Eastern European Jewish  musician, from the folklore plateau of amateurism and  elevated it to artistic heights, amazingly sophisticated,  profound in style and virtuosic eclat.\"92 This is a long  way from the avant-gardism of a John Zorn, who  considers all music equal--\"there's no high art and low  art.\" And, for that matter, from the ethos of the folk song  revival, which turned the hierarchy upside-down, but did  not get rid of it.  Inclusive as the folk song revival was, it could not  find a place for the Jewish instrumental tradition. Why  not? Clues may be found in debates over the definition of  folk song, the aesthetic of simple noise, and the  celebration of amateurism. Above all, for the revivalists,  folk song did not require elevation. On the contrary,  adorned performance was a statement in its own right, a  critique of the exclusive culture of classical music. There  was still a musical hierarchy, but in reverse. \"Low\" music  was good just as it was and maybe even better than \"high\"  music.   Reacting to the idea that folk song needed to be  dressed up for the concert stage, performers such as  Theodore Bikel brought an unvarnished voice, self-taught  guitar, international repertoire, and entertaining spiel to  their performance of folk song. Musical virtuosity was not  the point. Of his own abilities as a folk singer Oscar  Brand wrote in a playfully self-effacing tone, \"I even  learned to play the guitar in order to cover my vocal  deficiencies.\"93 A Canadian Jew who moved to the  United States, Brand began performing professionally  after leaving the United States Army in 1945. He can still  be heard today on WNYC 840/AM (Saturday, 7:00 p.m.),  where he hosts \"Folksong Festival with Oscar Brand.\"   In his 1962 account of the \"tidal wave of folk  singing,\" Brand defines the folk song in terms of sound,  what he calls \"simple noise,\" not provenance.94 Though  oral transmission will gradually wear away \"the unreal,  the phony, and the unnecessary,\" the patina of an antique  musical form can be fabricated instantly by those who  know how to achieve an \"artless, unself-conscious  quality\" and \"special ring of truth\" in their compositions  and performances.95 The locus classicus of \"simple  noise\" is the Anglo-American ballad. Brand is explicit on  this point: \"I can usually recognize this simplicity when I  meet it in American and Canadian song, but I find myself  less sure when I encounter the folk music of foreign lands.  I can humbly confess that most Chinese songs sound alike  to me. And the difference between a Kirghiz art song and  a Kirghiz folk song is beyond my comprehension.\"96  Several generations later, musicians such as Walter Z.  Feldman would be able not only to tell the difference, but  also to perform the music.  With its emphasis on storytelling, rather than  virtuosic musicianship, the ballad was considered a song  anyone could sing. The ethos of participation was so  strong that Professor Robert J. Potter, whom Brand  quotes, insisted that \"Folk music by its very nature doesn't  make perfectionist demands with respect to performance,  but is in some ways even 'better' if it is not perfect-- imperfection makes it more folksy.\"97 It requires \"no  more than average ability\" or even \"less than average  ability.\" Behind this overstatement of the inclusiveness of  the folk song revival is a critique of musical exclusivity:  \"Our nation is peopled with unfortunates who were tagged  as 'listeners' by harried kindergarten teachers, and,  consequently, fear the sound of their own voices raised in  song.\"98 Judging from the surge of guitar sales, the  enormous audiences at the Newport Festivals, and the  popularity of singing along, many people did ride the  wave of folk song interest.   Brand was not alone in defining folk song by effect,  an approach that separated the purists from the  popularizers. It was not long, however, before effect was  confounded with affectation and both were subjected to  parody and criticism.99 The purists objected to an  approach that was essentially theatrical, however much it  affected the effect of simple noise. Not surprisingly,  several singers, among them Bikel, were also professional  actors. To some extent Bikel approached his international  repertoire the way a character actor approaches a role.  While audiences were responsive, key figures in the  movement such as Alan Lomax took him to task: \"Alan  never seemed comfortable with me as a folk performer,  grudgingly accepting my Hebrew, Yiddish, or Russian  songs, but little else among the twenty-one languages in  which I perform, especially any Anglo-Saxon  material.\"100 Reflecting on the time when Lomax  prevented him from performing at a folklife-award  ceremony in Washington D.C., Bikel commented, \"One  more example of the folk purist fearing contamination  from 'show biz.'\"101  The international repertoire and musical sensibility of  a Theodore Bikel was more like continental cuisine than  local cooking, and it was down-home food prepared by  native cooks that the purists were after. Bikel's  performances were highly mediated by a set of aesthetic  practices specific to the revival itself. But, so too were the  performances of an Alameda Riddle or Huddie Ledbetter,  however different those practices might be.   Fault Lines of Sensibility  The decades immediately preceding the klezmer revival  are generally viewed as a wasteland. Traditional Jewish  instrumental music fell out of favor, and the folk song and  music revivals of the period showed no interest in it.  Viewed as a lull in musical interest, little remains to be  said. Viewed as a plenum of sensibility, the period holds  clues to the klezmer revival that followed. To track the  careers of Theodore Bikel, a rising professional folk  singer, and Mickey Katz, a veteran  instrumentalist/comedian, is to trace the fault lines of  changing structures of feeling.   Born in Vienna, Bikel left for Palestine with his  family in 1938 when he was fourteen years old. His  parents, ardent Zionists, were from Czernowitz, a city in  the eastern part of the Austrian-Hungarian empire before  World War I and in Romania after the war. Bikel was  born on Theodore Herzl's birthday and was named after  him. Active in a Zionist youth movement, he learned  Hebrew songs from Zionist propaganda films in Vienna  and added to his repertoire in Palestine, where he  completed school,102 lived on a kibbutz, and acted in the  Hebrew Theater. In 1946, he moved to London, where he  studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and  pursued a career in the theater. Both in London and in  Paris, which he visited frequently, he sought out folk  music and musicians in caf\u000es and bars, particularly  Russian expatriates who played gypsy music. He also  encouraged friends and acquaintances, including key  figures in the British and American folk song revivals, to  perform at parties in his home. Before long he was singing  folk songs in public. Within days of arriving in New York  in 1954 to perform in the Broadway play Tonight in  Samarkand, he attended a Pete Seeger concert at  Columbia University and introduced himself to Seeger-- the Weavers were still blacklisted at this time and their  recordings and performances were few and far between.   Bikel quickly became a part of the revival scene.  While Jewish repertoire may not have been central to the  folk song revival, Jews certainly were. They owned and  managed clubs and record companies. They were  composers, performers, agents, and managers. They were  writers and critics. Moses Asch, son of Sholem Asch,  established Folkways. Jac Holzman and Leonard Ripley  ran Elektra. Kenneth S. Goldstein issued innumerable  recordings of songs from the field. Israel Young ran the  Folklore Center on MacDougal Street. Aliza Greenblatt,  the mother of Woody Guthrie's former wife Marjorie, was  a published Yiddish poet; she wrote Der fisher, which has  become a favorite in the Yiddish song repertoire.103 Jean  Richie's husband, George Pickow, a Jew from New York,  made her an improved mountain dulcimer.104 The list  goes on.  Bikel recorded nineteen albums for Elektra, the first  of which, Folksongs of Israel, appeared in 1955. He sang  in twenty-one languages (he did not speak all of them)  and was a gifted impersonator. As he says of himself: \"I  was a character actor and considered my craft to demand  chameleon techniques.\"105 He brought a similar approach  to his international repertoire of songs and manner of  presentation, explaining that he could \"assume authentic  accents\" but was sometimes faulted for his \"willingness to  make a song accessible and palatable to an audience  unfamiliar with the material, instead of keeping the aloof  stance of a purist.\"106  The staged images on his album covers are consistent  with his theatrical approach to folk song performance. In  his recent autobiography, Bikel explained that \"Folksongs  of Israel showed an Israeli pioneer girl walking through  fields of the Jordan Valley. She was actually a New York  model, and the fields were on Long Island.\"107  Describing the cover of his first album of Yiddish songs,  he recalls that \"It shows me leaning on a guitar in front of  a Lower East Side brick wall with a theater poster on it,  listing the songs in Yiddish, and speaking to a young  yeshiva boy. The boy looked right, but was hardly likely  ever to see the inside of a yeshiva; when I called him over  to offer him a few dollars to pose with me saying, \"Come  here, yingele [kid],\" he asked, \"?Qu\u000e quiere?\" (What do  you want?) in pure Puerto Rican.\" 108 However irreverent  the in-joke, neither the image nor the music were in-your- face, in contrast with the sensibility of some neo- klezmers.   Bikel, as well as Martha Schlamme, performed  concerts at Town Hall, were featured at Newport  Festivals, and collaborated with leading revivalists such as  Pete Seeger and Oscar Brand. During the fifties, they not  only included Jewish songs on records with titles like  Folk Songs From Just About Everywhere (Bikel) and  Songs of Many Lands (Schlamme), but also issued  records devoted exclusively to what they called Jewish  folk songs. (When klezmer bands list the wide range of  what they play--the Mike Eisenstadt Band declares \"Our  speciality is anything!\"--they mean musical and  performance style and not just repertoire.)109  Schlamme, who spent her early years in Vienna, was  a classically trained soprano. She favored orchestral  accompaniment or flute and piano for her Yiddish,  Hebrew, and international songs. Shortly before her death,  she performed Yiddish songs with David Krakauer.  Though Bikel generally accompanied himself on guitar,  he also performed with orchestras and bands--Bill Lee, the  father of film maker Spike Lee, accompanied him on bass  and traveled with him on a concert tour through the South  during the sixties. If Bikel popularized a folk sound and  Schlamme concertized, Ruth Rubin was the purist. She  focused exclusively on Yiddish folk songs, which she  collected from oral tradition. Rubin performed these songs  a cappella, recorded them for Folkways, and presented her  extensive research in songbooks, published as early as  1950, and in Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish  Folk Song, which first appeared in 1963.110  These performers located the Jewishness of their  material in song and specifically in melodies and words.  Given that Yiddish folk song is a largely a cappella  tradition, what were singers headed for the stage to do?  Purists like Rubin simply performed them without  accompaniment. Not surprisingly, she was the most  attentive to the traditional vocal styles of those from  whom she collected the songs. Bikel's style owed more to  the Parisian caf\u000e and Greenwich Village coffee house,  where he learned much of his repertoire. He was more  inclined to learn songs from other professional singers and  to use instrumental accompaniment. In this way,  revivalists integrated the songs into an international  repertoire suitable for concert stage and hootenanny alike.  A constitutive feature of this approach was precisely the  recognition that the song (words and tunes) did not  emanate from the same source as the performance (vocal  style, setting, arrangement, accompaniment). The result  was not the eclectic fusions we see in the klezmer revival  or the incongruous juxtapositions of parodies of the  period, but the sounds of the revival itself.  The singers of Jewish repertoire that we remember  from this period were solo vocalists, with or without  accompaniment, not ensembles. Despite the popularity of  these performers, Yiddish folk song remained one of the  most vulnerable genres in the Jewish musical repertoire. It  had already begun the process of becoming \"heritage\"  during the late nineteenth century, if not earlier, with  efforts to collect, record, and arrange it for artistic  performance. Needless to say, few klezmer performers  today grew up speaking Yiddish, the sine qua non of the a  cappella Yiddish folk song tradition. While training in  classical music and jazz, and experience playing Balkan  and Appalachian traditional music, may have prepared  them for klezmer music, those who choose to sing must  also master enough Yiddish for the task. Interestingly,  more than one klezmer revival musician has characterized  the musical instrument, particularly the clarinet, as a  human voice, and the music itself as a language. David  Krakauer has said, \"I realized that klezmer music was the  Yiddish language in music\" and hears in it \"the sound and  inflection of my grandmother's very heavily, Yiddish- tinged English.\"111 For Alicia Svigals, klezmer is \"a  musical abstraction of the Yiddish language, and it simply  sounds 'Jewish' to our ears.\"112   Performing Obsolescence  As Benjamin Botkin has noted, \"Every revival contains  within itself the seed not only of its own destruction (in  our mass entertainment the destruction proceeds from  repetition and dullness as much as from catering to the  lowest common denominator) but also of the new  revivals.\"113 An indication that a revival (or other kind of  musical movement) has run its course is parody. The  Jewish music identified with Bikel became a prime target.  Allan Sherman's album My Son, the Folk Singer (1962)  was so funny and insightful, according to Richard  Gehman, that it was sure to \"send Theo Bikel into another  line of work.\"114 A year earlier, Bob Dylan had launched  an attack on the kind of music identified with Bikel when  he performed \"Talkin' Hava Negeilah Blues,\" which one  critic characterized as mocking \"the quintessential  American Jewish tune\"--it is the one Jewish tune that  David Krakauer can remember hearing when he was  growing up. Dylan's version was \"an epitaph for the  Hebrew folk songs sung by folk singers like Theodore  Bikel and the Weavers as a vaguely leftist, working-man's  ethnic repertoire. The mockery was prescient: The left  would not be strumming love songs about Israeli soldiers  much longer. Dylan, with his inspired instinct for the  authentic, was first to smell the phonies.\"115 So could Al  Capp, \"who introduced a new character into his widely  syndicated comic strip 'Little Abner' named 'Joanie  Phonie',\" based on Joan Baez.116  Some of the first neo-klezmers shared this sensibility.  NAMA Orchestra, based in Los Angeles, explained on  their 1978 album, Mazltov!, that what made their music  special and rare was precisely its departure from \"existing  records of Yiddish songs [which] tend to feature either  operatically trained vocalists accompanied by symphony  orchestras, or folk singers with a guitar.\"117 Unlike them,  NAMA's Pearl Rottenberg \"sings in a strong natural  voice, accompanied a small folk orchestra, such as might  have been found in the villages of Eastern Europe.\" The  term klezmer does not appear. The Jewish numbers are  part of the band's repertoire of largely Balkan folk music.  While Allan Sherman and Bob Dylan were quick to  parody the Jewish music they identified with Bikel, it  could be said that Bikel and Schlamme marked out a place  for Jewish music within an international folk music scene,  a place that would later be filled by klezmer music. So too  did the parodies. Parody is an integral part of the heritage  complex, a \"museum\" in its own right. The Jewish  parodists, not the revivalists, were the ones in the fifties  and sixties to compose new material and set  Jewish/Yiddish lyrics to popular tunes. At the same time,  they recognized that they were working with \"heritage  music.\" The cover for Mickey Katz Plays Music for  Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs and Brisses shows Katz \"sitting  in a baby carriage, presumably after my own bris,  smoking a cigar.\" However, this was not a comedy album,  but strictly a recording of instrumental numbers. Recalling  the late forties and fifties when he cut the English-Yiddish  comedy records for which he is so vividly remembered,  Katz said of this album, his second for Capitol, \"Every  note of the album breathes the flavor of the old but little- known happy Jewish music of the old country, yet all the  tunes are original.118 Parody also anticipates the  irreverence and eclecticism that would become hallmarks  of the klezmer revival.   The mapping of sensibility in this period--serious  music was respectful, irreverent music was comic--was  upturned as some of the new klezmers took irreverence  seriously. They produced not the Shtetl Lite of Fiddler on  the Roof, but what has been called Heavy Shtetl or \"the  new, in-your-face Jewish music.\"119 They and their fans  relished the mischief of Don Byron's performances of  Mickey Katz's music and the Klezmer Madness of David  Krakauer. The promotional copy on The Klezmorim's  Metropolis album positively describes their models as  musicians who \"played like demons,\" stirred \"dancers to a  frenzy,\" and exhibited a style \"full of unorthodox  tonalities and \"crazily-interlocking rhythms--the  rollicking, vodka-soaked sound of a steam calliope gone  mad.\" Three groups have named themselves Klezmania!  (San Francisco, Boston, and Melbourne, Australia) and a  New England high school band calls itself Klezmaniacs.   Parody is an example of what Steven Mullaney has  called a rehearsal of culture--namely, a performance that  is self-consuming in the sense that it is \"ultimately  organized around the elimination of its own pretext.\"120  As ethnographic burlesque, which has a long history and  was a tool of the Jewish Enlightenment, such parody  displays its target in extraordinary detail and makes that  display a vehicle for sensibility, which is what animates  the parody in the first place. Stempenyu, discussed by  Rothstein in this issue, is a case in point.  The Jewish wedding has long been the focus of such  treatment. A kind of primal scene of Jewish survival, the  wedding is where the promise and crisis of cultural  reproduction and biological survival get addressed both in  reverential and parodic performances of Jewish wedding  music and comic routines. Recordings of wedding  parodies were all the rage in the twenties, as Slobin has  noted, and not just among Jews.121 A comparison of  Jewish wedding parodies over time would chart a history  of changing structures of feeling from David Fr \"Gallery of Obnoxious Abuses, Shocking Customs, and  Absurd Ceremonies of the Jews,\" in Sulamit during the  early nineteenth century to Der Mesader Kedushin and Di  boyberiker khasene in the twenties to Mickey Katz's  affectionate lobs of the fifties. Seen as musical  performances of cohort awareness, these displays of  cultural connoisseurship in the breach chart the  generational structure of sensibility and its sounds.122 No  one exemplifies this moment more vividly than Mickey  Katz.  In his roles as musician, comedian, and radio host,  Katz presided over the obsolescence of what he called  \"the old but little-known happy Jewish music of the old  country.\"123 Katz, who was born in 1909, had been doing  English-Yiddish parodies of fairy tales on the radio as a  teenager in Doc Whipple's big band in Cleveland in the  twenties. But it was only in 1947, after he broke up with  Spike Jones, that Katz made English-Yiddish parody a  speciality. The Barton Brothers had brought out several  parody records, which made Katz think there might be a  market for his own routines. Jewish executives at RCA  were taken with the idea and Katz proceeded to record  parodies of current hits. The first singles by Mickey Katz  and His Kosher Jammers were, by his own account, a sell  out success: \"I had given the Jewish record-buying public  something they evidently wanted and up to now hadn't  had.\"124 There followed the Borscht Capades, with his  son Joel Grey, and a stint as a \"kosher disc jockey\" in  Southern California from 1951 to 1956.125  In addition to playing his own records, Katz's radio  show featured everything from Al Jolson's \"The  Anniversary Waltz\" and Yiddish recordings by operatic  cantors to symphonic arrangements of Jewish folk music,  songs about the Holocaust, and Israeli recordings.  Summing up the experience, Katz writes: \"The greatest  personal satisfaction I got from my radio show was its  wide appeal. Thousands of people of all faiths loved the  haimish (homey) Jewish music and the lively  frailachs.\"126 Though Katz did most of his talking in  English, the Yiddish flavor of the show and the repertoire  he featured would have appealed to an older generation.  This assumption is borne out by the jokes he tells about  his audience:  Jewish mamas and papas have always loved waltzes.  There's a wonderful story about the old couple who were  dancing in Miami Beach. In the old days all the hotels  there had \"dancing classes.\" And since it was Florida, the  dancing classes usually featured Latin music. Well, one  day our elderly couple were dancing to Pupi Campo's  band at one of the hotels, and Sam, trying to keep up with  the lively Latin rhythm, was stepping all over his wife's  feet. Finally, she said, \"Waltz a little faster, Sam; they're  playing a fox-trot.\"127  While the show's success was a vindication of sorts,  by the early fifties, Katz was finding it \"slow going.\" He  was encountering resistance to his routines. After his first  show at Slapsie Maxie's in Los Angeles, the owner- manager came to Katz's dressing room and declared,  \"There will be no Yiddish done in this club!\" and Spike  Jones suggested Katz supply a libretto for the Yiddish- challenged.128 The Jewish manager of a radio station in  Los Angeles refused to play his records. He said Katz's  records were insulting and besides, \"I don't play any  ethnic records,\" which was not the case--he did play  Mexican music.129 A Philadelphia station manager (not  Jewish) refused to play Katz's records \"Because some of  our listeners are offended. . . . I will not play any record  with Yiddish in it. Yiddish is the language of the  ghetto.\"130  Katz, in the autobiography from which I take these  accounts, attributes the hostility he encountered to shame  on the part of Jews and anti-Semitism on the part of non- Jews--he also acknowledged that not everyone in his  audience could understand Yiddish. What he does not  address is precisely what some people found so funny and  others so \"insulting\" and \"offensive\" This is a subject  worthy of a study in its own right. Suffice it to note that  Katz's parodies of incompetence were highly virtuosic.  They required a mastery not only of multiple linguistic  and musical idioms, but also of incongruous  juxtapositions.131 This art, governed by a different  sensibility, lives on in such recordings as Rechnitzer  Rejects, which were produced in the eighties.132  Katz's Yiddish humor appealed to a contracting circle  of \"insiders\" as well as to the children of Yiddish speakers  for whom just the sound of Yiddish was funny or  offensive, quite apart from the meaning of the words.  Uriel Weinreich has noted how obsolescent languages  acquire esoteric value and comic associations: \"Among  the children of American immigrants, the mere utterance  of a word in their parents' language easily evokes  laughter.\"133 Whatever status Yiddish may have had as a  primary medium of communication, it is as an obsolescent  language, a stylistic specialization, that it figures in Katz's  English-Yiddish routines. It is characteristic of  obsolescent languages that \"colorful idiomatic  expressions, difficult to translate, with strong affective  overtones, whether endearing, pejorative, or mildly  obscene\" turn up in discourse that is \"informal and  uninhibited by pretensions of high social status.\"134 Food  terms are likely to be part of the mix. (Sure enough, they  turn up today in the humorous names of neo-klezmer  bands such as Nosh, Lox & Vodka, Hot Latkes, and  Shawn's Kugel.) Setting Yiddish lyrics to a hit parade tune  intensified the comic effect.  The mixed responses to Katz's performances in the  fifties point to shifts in sensibility. During the Cold War,  Jews had good reason to be nervous. Obsolescence is one  thing, genocide is another. As early as 1943, Maurice  Samuel described The World of Sholom Aleichem as an  act of necromancy, a calling up from the dead.135 He  converted what Sholem Aleichem's nineteenth-century  readers had read as satire into elegiac ethnography. The  World of Sholom Aleichem was one of several such  treatments of a destroyed world that appeared in the  forties and fifties. Others include Bella Chagall's Burning  Lights and Heschel's The Earth Is the Lord's: The Inner  World of the Jew in Eastern Europe, both of which  appeared in Yiddish and in English translation, and Life Is  with People: The Culture of the Shtetl, the first major  ethnography of East European Jewish culture to appear in  English.136 Ambivalence about that world, an  ambivalence that informed both the immigrant experience  and the Zionist movement, was put to a severe test after  World War II. It was one thing to be ambivalent about a  way of life that posed a threat to success in America or the  establishment of a Jewish homeland. Condemning a  destroyed world to oblivion was another matter.  Evocations of a vanished world reached their apogee  in Fiddler on the Roof (1964), which, together with Marc  Chagall's imagery, made the klezmer the icon of an  irretrievable world--and, from then on, albums of Yiddish  song often included songs from this popular musical.  However sentimental such elegies may seem to us today,  they attempted to deal with what came to be known as the  Holocaust before it was possible to deal directly with the  genocide. In a period where memory vacillated between  sad nostalgia and outraged horror, hope attached itself to  establishing a Jewish homeland and creating a new life  there or elsewhere.  No wonder Mickey Katz had a difficult time finding  a niche for his English-Yiddish parodies. They spoke to  the experience of an earlier generation of immigrants,  those who had come far enough to be able to laugh at the  \"incompetence\" Katz performed with such virtuosity. That  experience had become irrelevant, if not embarrassing, to  a suburbanized generation of respectable Jews. The  Yiddishists of the Yiddish day schools and summer  camps, Workman's Circle, and YIVO Institute for Jewish  Research considered Borscht Belt culture vulgar. It was a  threat to the Yiddish civilization for whose very survival  they fought. As for the newest Yiddish speakers to arrive  on the scene, a young generation of refugees and  survivors, what were they to make of Katz's parodies. In  the wake of the Holocaust, those routines had become an  irreverent tombstone, a sacrilege, an affront to changed  sensibilities. In the fifties, Bikel could write obscene  graffiti on the record cover of his first album of Yiddish  folk songs. Forty years later he would begin his  autobiography with the Holocaust, not with his birth, and  write of his own narrow escape, \"Maybe I was meant to  use my voice as a warning that history must not repeat  itself.\"137   The Jewish Space  Since the Holocaust, there have appeared innumerable  evocations of \"vanished communities,\" eleventh-hour  documentaries of the \"last Jews\" of Eastern Europe, and  increasingly, Holocaust memorials. Those memorials,  seen historically, also reflect shifts in sensibility,  particularly as the children of survivors find their own  voices. Art Spiegelman's Maus is but one example of what  Gilad Melzer calls irreverent memory. He considers the  problem of representing the Holocaust \"properly\" in  relation to new generational sensibilities and the  \"Holocaust rock music\" of such Israeli musicians as  Yehuda Poliker.138 Today, Central and Eastern Europe  are no longer the nowhere of an evacuated Yiddishland.  Not only is there a modest renewal of Jewish life and  communities and a major influx of Jewish tourists, but  also \"the 'Jewish space' in Europe . . . is increasingly  attracting non-Jews,\" in the words of historian Diana  Pinto.139 They are the primary audience in Europe for  klezmer music, particularly as performed by American  Jewish musicians, but also by bands with names like  Klezgoyim. In the estimation of Alan Bern, the virtuosic  accordionist in Brave Old World, some non-Jewish  musicians perform klezmer music \"better than Jewish  musicians who count as leaders of the revival.\"140 If, as  Liberman declared, old-time klezmorim \"bridged the  cultural abyss between the ghetto and the world,\" the neo- klezmers are filling a new kind of Jewish space, no less  imagined than the topoi of ghetto and shtetl.141  A hero of the contemporary European klezmer scene  is Giora Feidman. While the San Francisco Klezmorim  are generally credited with being the first to record neo- klezmer music, in 1977, Feidman debuted his Jewish  \"soul music\" in 1972 and issued his first klezmer album in  1973. \"King of Klezmer in the world today,\" Feidman  bases the purity of his performances of klezmer music not  on scrupulous attention to reconstruction but to distilling  the \"essence\" of what he calls \"Jewish soul music.\"142  Born of a romantic mysticism, his etherial musical  interpretations depend more on inspiration than fidelity to  an authoritative musical \"text.\" The preciousness of his  performances is better suited to the concert stage and  movie soundtrack, than to the dance floor or downtown  club. While his fans embrace his music as a \"universal  language\" and medium of international brotherhood, his  critics object to his rarefied treatment of an earthy musical  idiom. They object to his sensibility; liner notes for his  early albums refer to \"Jewish Folk Music\" and \"little  worlds\" (among them Fiddler on the Roof and  contemporary Israel) and his repertoire draws from film  scores as well as Hasidic Music Festivals and the music of  Middle Eastern Jewish communities living in Israel.  \"Maestro Feidman,\" as he is referred to on his albums  and on The Giora Feidman Home Page, is not of the same  cohort as the American neo-klezmers. Born in Argentina,  Feidman immigrated to Israel in 1957 to accept the  invitation to join the clarinet section of the Israel  Philharmonic Orchestra. While he describes himself as a  fourth-generation klezmer, it is precisely this yikhes (and  his extraordinary talent as a classical musician) that  authorizes his distillations and the bold claims he makes  for them. His largest followings are in Germany and  Israel, where relationships to the East European Jewish  past are particularly fraught, whether as the legacy of  Nazism or Zionism.  Groups like the Klezmer-Gesellschaft e.V, founded  in Berlin in 1990 and their Klezmer Orchestra, established  in 1995, are attracted to Feidman's celebration of klezmer  music's universality because it gives them \"permission\"  not only to play the music, but also to claim it:  klezmorim, they explain, \"usually were Jewish, but not  necessarily. They usually played at Jewish celebrations-- but not only. And that was why they integrated into their  repertoire the traditional music of their surroundings. The  style of playing and the repertoire are characterized by  both the tradition, vivid modifications, and new  perceptions. That is exactly, what we now call klezmer  music.\"143 The Klezmer-Gesellschaft was founded by  musicians who took Feidman's workshops and Feidman is  also a member of the society. He is an active teacher and  has issued numerous instructional recordings and books.  In the United States, Balkanarama has created a slot  for klezmer music in a list that includes Albania, Bosnia,  Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia,  Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, and The Roma (Gypsies). The  topos of music as place, a site of imagined community,  can be found in the instruction, \"Welcome to the Republic  of Balkanarama. Please surrender your passport at this  time.\"144 The place is then--a dreamy chronotope of  Jewish gypsies, fiddling their way from place to place,  picking up the sounds around them, and fusing them into  a zany foot-tapping musical icon pierced by the soulful  cry of a fiddle or clarinet.145 The place is not now.   Moreover, the music, once it has been universalized,  is no longer even Jewish--\"Klezmer is not Jewish music,\"  Feidman has said, explaining that \"Everyone is born a  singer. God gave to us an instrument of song, our body.  This is klezmer.\"146 Nothing could be further from the  sensibility of American neo-klezmers. Or, from those who  remember hearing the old-timers, some of whom were  young at the time and alternated playing Jewish and jazz  gigs. The \"indigenous music\" of klezmorim, which Nat  Hentoff defined as \"improvising Yiddish musicians,\"  reminded him of jazz, but with a critical difference: \"the  cadences, the timbres, the swirling rhythms went back to  far different places and times than the jazz I also loved. It  was more from these sounds than from any reading that  my sense of the old country first began to be vivid.\"147 If  the music took Nat Hentoff back to Minsk and Pinsk and  offered David Krakauer a \"musical home,\" it lets Don  Byron \"take you to a place you may have avoided and  make you feel comfortable there.\"148 That place is out. It  is on the edge. It is radical in the contradictory senses of  rooted and extreme. Such are the fault lines of sensibility  defined by klezmer music of the nineties.    Notes  I would like to thank John Czaplicka, Max Gimblett,  Harvey Goldberg, Marian Jacobson, Mark Kligman,  Elliott Oring, and Mark Slobin for their careful reading  and thoughtful comments on this paper.  1.

Excerpts from this review appeared  on the jacket of The Klezmorim's second album, Streets of  Gold (Arhoolie Records, Arhoolie 3011, El Cerrito, CA,  1978).
