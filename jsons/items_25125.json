A thorough grounding in contemporary art history and critical theory helps students explore issues in their own work and that of others. Studio courses in a wide variety of disciplines mix the rich visual traditions of the past with emerging forms and ideas. Interdisciplinary classes, which integrate modern and postmodern approaches with experimental artistic practices, encourage students to envision fresh new ways of making art.    Located in the center of the international art world, the NYU program allows students to participate directly in the evolution of contemporary culture, viewing exciting exhibitions, and attending important lectures and live performances as they happen. Because our program offers the vast academic resources of a major research university as well as a studio faculty of accomplished professional artists, we are able to prepare students for meaningful careers in the arts, while exposing them to a rich cultural environment that far exceeds the scope of more narrowly defined art programs.
