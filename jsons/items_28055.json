Writing the One-Hour Television Drama    NCRD-UT 8008 Pre-requisite: Intro to Writing the Half Hour Comedy       A course for starting a one-hour dramatic script, OR for revising/completing a One-Hour script begun last year. (Students will arrive at this class at different levels of expertise.) For those students new to writing a One-Hour, this television workshop course takes the student step by step through writing their own script for an ongoing one-hour television dramatic series. The course will go from premise lines, through the outline, to writing a solid draft of the script. This is a high-level course that prepares students for the professional world. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .      Intro to Writing the Half Hour Comedy    NCRD-UT 8005 This intensive scriptwriting class answers the question, \u201cWhat do I need to break into TV writing?\u201d The student will be guided through the step-by-step development of an episode for an ongoing TV sitcom, from premise line to one-page outline, to pages and revisions. The course requires the completion of a polished draft while introducing students to the rigors of professional standards through weekly story goals. The course is taught by a professional television writer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683  View course schedule .      Sketch Comedy Writing NCRD-UT 8012 This is a sketch writing workshop class. A survey of sketch genres and approaches will be integrated with writing assignments and rewriting of one's own sketches: both privately and collaboratively. The goal is for each student to emerge from the class with several polished sketches. For this class, it helps to have a good sense of humor that you want to get even better at putting down on the page. There will be a lot of group critiquing and occasionally group rewriting. So it helps to stop thinking that your first draft is perfect. Because it isn't. This can be a pretty wild class, so it also helps to never think that comedy can go \"too far.\" The course may have a guest lecturer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .
