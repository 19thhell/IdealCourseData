Parks  published in American Artist, May 2012       Animation is one of the fastest-growing fields in the visual arts. From its beginnings as primarily a children\u2019s-entertainment medium, it has blossomed into a form that is integrated into almost every facet of moving imagery, from live-action feature films such as Jurassic Park and Hugo to title graphics, commercials, and non-fiction filmmaking. New techniques in digital manipulation of images have spurred much of this growth, but studios such as Pixar and Disney still employ large numbers of artists whose traditional drawing abilities and creative imagination are indispensable to any successful project. For anyone interested in animation, the Kanbar Institute of Film and Television at New York University\u2019s (NYU) Tisch School of the Arts offers the opportunity to study with some of the finest practitioners in the field. Heading up the department is the world-renowned filmmaker John Canemaker, whose movie The Moon and the Son: An Imagined Conversation , which tells the story of Canemaker\u2019s difficult relationship with his father, won the 2005 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Canemaker recently talked to American Artist about his own artistic background and the opportunities offered by the animation program at NYU. \u201cI made my first animations when I was a teenager growing up in Elmira, New York,\u201d recalls Canemaker. \u201cBut when I left home and came to New York City, I wasn\u2019t sure what I wanted to do.\u201d He began as an actor, appearing in dozens of commercials and off Broadway productions. He served two years in the Army, and then put himself through college with the help of the GI Bill. As he approached his 30s, Canemaker\u2019s early interest in animation began to re-emerge. \u201cI took a course in the night school at the School of Visual Arts,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI made a film there and used that as my \u2018reel\u2019 to start getting jobs as a journeyman animator. And then I formed my own company in 1981 and went on from there.\u201d In addition to his animation work and extensive teaching experience, Canemaker has also written 10 books on the history of animation that are considered essential reading on the subject. He is currently working on his eleventh book, about the special effects in early Disney films. The animation department at NYU occupies a suite of airy studios filled with computer stations equipped with the latest tools of the trade. These days, software is combined with touch-sensitive tablets and screens to allow artists to draw directly into the computer, a far cry from pre-digital days when each image was drawn by hand and then photographed as a still. The computer gives the animator an extraordinary level of control over animated sequences, but for all the technical wizardry that the school makes available, Canemaker is quick to stress that it is not the most important part of the business. \u201cMore important than how well you draw or how well you master the techniques is how well you tell the story,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of our students are not trained draftsmen, and many have never thought of themselves as animators. What we say to them is that it doesn\u2019t matter how well you draw, it\u2019s how you use what you have in terms of telling the story and creating characters that make an audience sit up and take notice.\u201d In order to bring these abilities into play, the animation department offers a comprehensive and diverse array of classes, covering both traditional and computer based techniques. Courses such as drawing and anatomy are cornerstones of the curriculum. \u201cEven the Pixar artists still find drawing to be an essential art form in order to do what they do,\u201d Canemaker says. Other offerings include action analysis, in which students learn the mechanics of motion; digital animation; 3-D techniques; and a new visual-effects course; as well as liberal-arts classes in other NYU departments. In animation everything must be planned ahead, so storyboards are a decisive creative stage. \u201cIt\u2019s all pre-edited,\u201d says Canemaker. \u201cThere is some level of creative input that goes on in the animation process, but I believe that the most creative aspect is the conceptual stage and the writing stage. It\u2019s the storyboarding stage where you are really putting together who the characters are, how they are driving the story, and what their personalities are going to be. The rest is production.\u201d    Animated films remain the central interest for Canemaker, but his department is fully aware that animation is now often used in conjunction with live action. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to see a film now that doesn\u2019t incorporate some form of animation somewhere,\u201d says Canemaker. In response to this trend, students in the school\u2019s live-action filmmaking programs are increasingly taking animation courses. Canemaker encourages students to explore a variety of career paths. He emphasizes that the skills one learns in animation can lead to jobs with big studios and also other interesting opportunities. \u201cYou have to plug in somewhere,\u201d he says. \u201cYou build your r\u00e9sum\u00e9, you meet people, you network, you increase your reel, and then you move on to the next thing.\u201d As one example of a student who found success in an unexpected place, Canemaker cites a young woman who had never taken animation before but began to do character animation in the program. \u201cShe was very good,\u201d he says. \u201cShe finalized her film. She graduated. She did not get an internship, and she did not get an offer from a studio. She went back to her hometown, in Southern California, and she saw an ad in the paper that said \u2018Wanted: Someone to draw our mascot.\u2019 It was for an organization that did educational films and videos.\u201d During her interview, the company discovered that she had worked on storyboards at NYU, and they hired her to create storyboards for their own projects. She now heads a small department at the company. Although Canemaker, like most of today\u2019s educators, is concerned that his students go on to find viable careers, he obviously retains his idealism as an artist and creator. \u201cIt sounds corny, but I believe that when you do things that you really love to do, then something good comes out of it,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that there is always some reward.\u201d     Undergraduate Film 721 Broadway, 11th Floor New York, NY 10003               Phone:       212 998 1700           Undergraduate Admissions Graduate Admissions Academic Services Student Life Financial Aid and Scholarships Career Development Counseling Services International Students Incoming Students Graduation Forms What is Special Programs?
