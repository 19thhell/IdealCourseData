Whether you are looking for sublets, apartment rentals, or roommates, there are a variety of factors that you need to consider first. Check out our Glossary page for more information on commonly used terms in the NYC rental market.     Manage your expectations. The newer the apartment, the appliances, the facilities and conveneiences - like proximity to a subway or even NYU, means a higher price. Elevators and a doorman add to the price as well. Be open to the possibility of having to live in Brookly, Queens or even New Jersey to get a better price and more space. Know your wants from your must haves -- more than one bathroom or bedroom, quiet neighborhood, closet space, safety of the neighborhood, building amentieis. Basically, go into your search knowing what you can live with and what you can't live without!     Questions to Ask     As you begin your search, make sure to include these questions to your own:       Are utilities included in the rent?     Are pets allowed?     Is pest extermination an additional expense or a service provided by the building management?     Does the superintendent live on site? If not, is one available by phone?   How close are the nearest police and fire stations?     Are the building and surrounding areas well illuminated at night?     How close is the building to high traffic, well-traveled areas?     Is there a security system in the building?     Does the building have a doorman or buzzer system for guests and deliveries?     Are the locks on the doors of the building and the space adequately secure?     Is there a peephole in the door to see who is calling?     Is there a sufficient number of working smoke detectors in the living space and hallways?     Are there adequate emergency escape routes in case of fire?     What is the area's crime rate? (Statistics of reported crimes can be obtained by visiting the local police precinct closest to the building.)   How accessible is the building for a person in a wheelchair or other mobility issues.          Applications for an Apartment   Landlords generally approve applicants based on the strength and/or balance of an individual's income, credit, assets, and guarantor. The following are commonly required information and details that will help you prepare for completing an application for an apartment:     Income In Manhattan - most landlords will require that you earn annually at least 40 to 50 times the amount of the monthly rent. If the rent is $1500 per month, you may need to show approx. $60,000 in annual income. In the outlying areas of Manhattan (Brooklyn, Queens, NJ, etc.) most landlords will require less income, approximately 30 to 35 times the amount of monthly rent. Roommate/Shares and Sublets may require less annual income as well.   Grants, Scholarships, Stipends, Fellowships/Assistantships, and other awards are considered income. Loans, although currently a source of income, are essentially future debt. Many landlords may look less favorably on loans as income without additional qualifying support (guarantor or paying multiple months rent up-front).   Credit - Having good credit is important, and it is a major part of the approval process. Landlords use your credit rating and history to make an assessment concerning your bill paying habits and responsibility to debt. If your income is lower than the customary requirement, a higher credit score (e.g., 700 or more) will help.     Bad Credit - a few late payments in your past may not hurt your credit but high credit card balances, past due or late payments, delinquincies and collections or a Housing Court ruling. If your credit score is lower (e.g., 550 or less), it can hurt your application and prevent you from getting the apartment.     Assets - Additional assets will help your application. Many students may not have enough income to meet the customary requirements, and either have weak or no credit history at all (this is particularly true for international students). If you have 6 to 12 months of rent available in a bank account (loans, parents, grants), landlords may accept multiple months of rent or security deposit paid in advance as an alternative way of approving you (*Make sure this arrangement is in writing*). If your credit is very poor, some landlords may still refuse to rent to you.   Guarantor - For students or young individuals who do not meet the income, or credit requirements, a guarantor might be the solution. A guarantor (co-signor) is someone who is willing to take the financial liability of your lease if you are unable or unwilling to fulfill it. The guarantor is generally not required to pay anything in order to get you approved; however by agreeing to guarantee you, they are responsible for all terms of your lease. If you are sharing an apartment, it is important to understand the guarantor is ultimately responsible for the entire lease. Landlords may accept multiple guarantors, however, they are not legally obligated to do so. If a landlord is inclined to refuse an application based on poor credit, the decision to allow a guarantor for approval may depend on how bad the credit is and how strict their policies are. Sometimes a combination of guarantor and extra security are needed.     *A note for international students: Landlords may ask for three or more months' deposit on an apartment if you do not have a guarantor who is employed in the United States.

Using a Real Estate Broker   A very common way to find an apartment in New York City is through a real estate broker. New York State licenses real estate brokers and salespersons. Brokers charge a commission for their services which is usually a stated percentage of the first year\u2019s rent. The amount of the commission is not set by law and should be negotiated between the parties. The broker must assist the client in finding and obtaining an apartment before a commission may be charged. The fee should not be paid until the client is offered a lease signed by the landlord. The broker may also charge the client a reasonable amount to conduct a credit check. Under the Rent Stabilization Code, a broker\u2019s commission may be considered \u201crent\u201d in excess of legal rent when there is too close of a business or financial connection between the broker and the landlord.

Below, we have compiled a list of websites that will assist you in your apartment search. These websites will help you get acquainted with what type of apartment options are being advertised, as well as information on costs, ammenities, and the local area. These sites also allow you to search for rentals that meet your specific requirements, and to organize your search along the way.     The websites we have provided on this page are provided to assist you with your search based on feedback from other students who found the sites helpful. Please keep in mind that NYU does not have any relationship with these companies, unless otherwise noted, and inclusion on this list does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement. NYU is unable to vet any website or listing, so please conduct your search carefully.                apartmentguide.com   apartmentlist.com   Campus (community living)   craigslist.org   crashdwell.com   CampusCribz     gonofee.com/   insidedigs.com   livelovely.com   myapartmentmap.com   myspacenyc.com   nybits.com     nycintern.org   nyhabitat.com   padmapper.com   rent.com   renthackr.com/   renthop.com   renterst.com   streeteasy.com   studenthousing.org   cityspade.com   trulia.com   urbanedgeny.com   zumper.com     Facebook Group (not affiliated with NYU)   Brickunderground (Insider's Guide to Real Estate)   Leasebreak                                                                                    Finding a Roommate                                                                                               Summer Housing at NYU                                             Avoiding Scams     We all know someone or have heard about the scams that take place on websites, so here are some tips for you to consider when searching online:     Trust your gut!  If you read a listing that sounds great, but something just feels off, trust what you feel. If you get an uneasy feeling from emailing a potential landlord or feel that something just isn\u2019t right, do NOT follow through.   If it sounds too good to be true\u2026 it is.  If a fully furnished, 2-bedroom apartment is for rent in the West Village in a luxury, high-rise, doorman building for $500, it most likely isn\u2019t real.     Never wire money overseas or send cash.  Many scammers prefer not to meet their victims face to face. Instead, the owner (read: scammer) will \u201cunfortunately\u201d be out of town, or out of the country. You\u2019ll be asked to wire them the funds via Western Union or MoneyGram, and then you\u2019ll never hear from them again. Only hand over money once you\u2019ve physically been to the address and physically been inside the apartment with an agent.     Deal Locally.  Only deal locally or with people that you can meet in person - follow this one simple rule and you will avoid 99% of the scam attempts. If they cannot meet with you, that should raise a red flag. Make sure you have a phone number and even an office location that you can verify with the person showing you the apartment.     FAKE CASHIER CHECKS &amp; MONEY ORDERS ARE COMMON, and BANKS WILL CASH THEM AND THEN HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE when the fake is discovered weeks later.   Most websites are not accountable.  Unless it is specifically stated on their website, most websites are NOT INVOLVED IN ANY TRANSACTION, and do not handle payments, guarantee transactions, vet properties or listers, provide escrow services, or offer &quot;buyer protection&quot; or &quot;seller certification\u201d. If you are scammed, websites are not likely to reimburse you or take responsibility. They are simply providing a means to which information can be shared.     Never give out financial information.  Never send anyone a bank account number, social security number, eBay/PayPal info, etc. AVOID DEALS INVOLVING SHIPPING OR ESCROW SERVICES and know that ONLY A SCAMMER WILL &quot;GUARANTEE&quot; YOUR TRANSACTION.   Recognizing scams.  Key words in a scam advertisement: inquiry from someone far away, often in another country, Western Union, Money Gram, cashier's check, money order, cash only, shipping, escrow service, or a &quot;guarantee&quot;inability or refusal to meet face-to-face before consumating transaction, no phone number or physical location of an office.     New York City is a much safer place. Be smart about your decision, don't feel pushed or rushed into it, and again, trust your feelings. If by chance you happen to be a victim of a scam, then call the police and report it as soon as possible. If you pulled a listing off a website, notify the website owner as well so others don't become a victim.

Be prepared to discover that vacancies do not make themselves known until approximately thirty days before move-in. It will be difficult to view an available apartment before this. Any apartment you find well in advance of your desired move-in date will likely not be vacant when you are ready to move. A two to four week period is usually sufficient for an apartment search in New York City.   That being said, you can use the time leading up to your actual search to review online listings, look at neighborhoods, and review market data so that you are prepared and confident when you begin your housing search in earnest.

Whether you are looking for sublets, apartment rentals, or roommates, there are a variety of factors that you need to consider first. Check out our Glossary page for more information on commonly used terms in the NYC rental market.     Manage your expectations. The newer the apartment, the appliances, the facilities and conveneiences - like proximity to a subway or even NYU, means a higher price. Elevators and a doorman add to the price as well. Be open to the possibility of having to live in Brookly, Queens or even New Jersey to get a better price and more space. Know your wants from your must haves -- more than one bathroom or bedroom, quiet neighborhood, closet space, safety of the neighborhood, building amentieis. Basically, go into your search knowing what you can live with and what you can't live without!     Questions to Ask     As you begin your search, make sure to include these questions to your own:       Are utilities included in the rent?     Are pets allowed?     Is pest extermination an additional expense or a service provided by the building management?     Does the superintendent live on site? If not, is one available by phone?   How close are the nearest police and fire stations?     Are the building and surrounding areas well illuminated at night?     How close is the building to high traffic, well-traveled areas?     Is there a security system in the building?     Does the building have a doorman or buzzer system for guests and deliveries?     Are the locks on the doors of the building and the space adequately secure?     Is there a peephole in the door to see who is calling?     Is there a sufficient number of working smoke detectors in the living space and hallways?     Are there adequate emergency escape routes in case of fire?     What is the area's crime rate? (Statistics of reported crimes can be obtained by visiting the local police precinct closest to the building.)   How accessible is the building for a person in a wheelchair or other mobility issues.          Applications for an Apartment   Landlords generally approve applicants based on the strength and/or balance of an individual's income, credit, assets, and guarantor. The following are commonly required information and details that will help you prepare for completing an application for an apartment:     Income In Manhattan - most landlords will require that you earn annually at least 40 to 50 times the amount of the monthly rent. If the rent is $1500 per month, you may need to show approx. $60,000 in annual income. In the outlying areas of Manhattan (Brooklyn, Queens, NJ, etc.) most landlords will require less income, approximately 30 to 35 times the amount of monthly rent. Roommate/Shares and Sublets may require less annual income as well.   Grants, Scholarships, Stipends, Fellowships/Assistantships, and other awards are considered income. Loans, although currently a source of income, are essentially future debt. Many landlords may look less favorably on loans as income without additional qualifying support (guarantor or paying multiple months rent up-front).   Credit - Having good credit is important, and it is a major part of the approval process. Landlords use your credit rating and history to make an assessment concerning your bill paying habits and responsibility to debt. If your income is lower than the customary requirement, a higher credit score (e.g., 700 or more) will help.     Bad Credit - a few late payments in your past may not hurt your credit but high credit card balances, past due or late payments, delinquincies and collections or a Housing Court ruling. If your credit score is lower (e.g., 550 or less), it can hurt your application and prevent you from getting the apartment.     Assets - Additional assets will help your application. Many students may not have enough income to meet the customary requirements, and either have weak or no credit history at all (this is particularly true for international students). If you have 6 to 12 months of rent available in a bank account (loans, parents, grants), landlords may accept multiple months of rent or security deposit paid in advance as an alternative way of approving you (*Make sure this arrangement is in writing*). If your credit is very poor, some landlords may still refuse to rent to you.   Guarantor - For students or young individuals who do not meet the income, or credit requirements, a guarantor might be the solution. A guarantor (co-signor) is someone who is willing to take the financial liability of your lease if you are unable or unwilling to fulfill it. The guarantor is generally not required to pay anything in order to get you approved; however by agreeing to guarantee you, they are responsible for all terms of your lease. If you are sharing an apartment, it is important to understand the guarantor is ultimately responsible for the entire lease. Landlords may accept multiple guarantors, however, they are not legally obligated to do so. If a landlord is inclined to refuse an application based on poor credit, the decision to allow a guarantor for approval may depend on how bad the credit is and how strict their policies are. Sometimes a combination of guarantor and extra security are needed.     *A note for international students: Landlords may ask for three or more months' deposit on an apartment if you do not have a guarantor who is employed in the United States.

The guarantor is responsible for all terms of your lease and guaranties not only your share of the rent but the entire lease - if in a share situation.

Using a Real Estate Broker   A very common way to find an apartment in New York City is through a real estate broker. New York State licenses real estate brokers and salespersons. Brokers charge a commission for their services which is usually a stated percentage of the first year\u2019s rent. The amount of the commission is not set by law and should be negotiated between the parties. The broker must assist the client in finding and obtaining an apartment before a commission may be charged. The fee should not be paid until the client is offered a lease signed by the landlord. The broker may also charge the client a reasonable amount to conduct a credit check. Under the Rent Stabilization Code, a broker\u2019s commission may be considered \u201crent\u201d in excess of legal rent when there is too close of a business or financial connection between the broker and the landlord.   For a list of brokers, not affiliated with NYU, however provided as they have indicated an interest in working with college students in their search for accommodations, is available under the Apartment Search Links tab .

Below, we have compiled a list of websites that will assist you in your apartment search. These websites will help you get acquainted with what type of apartment options are being advertised, as well as information on costs, ammenities, and the local area. These sites also allow you to search for rentals that meet your specific requirements, and to organize your search along the way.     The websites we have provided on this page are provided to assist you with your search based on feedback from other students who found the sites helpful. Please keep in mind that NYU does not have any relationship with these companies, unless otherwise noted, and inclusion on this list does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement. NYU is unable to vet any website or listing, so please conduct your search carefully.                apartmentguide.com   apartmentlist.com   Campus (community living)   craigslist.org   crashdwell.com   CampusCribz     gonofee.com/   insidedigs.com   livelovely.com   myapartmentmap.com   myspacenyc.com   nybits.com     nycintern.org   nyhabitat.com   padmapper.com   rent.com   renthackr.com/   renthop.com   renterst.com   streeteasy.com   studenthousing.org   cityspade.com   trulia.com   urbanedgeny.com   zumper.com     Facebook Group (not affiliated with NYU)   Brickunderground (Insider's Guide to Real Estate)   Leasebreak                                                                                    Finding a Roommate                                                                                               Summer Housing at NYU                                             Avoiding Scams     We all know someone or have heard about the scams that take place on websites, so here are some tips for you to consider when searching online:     Trust your gut!  If you read a listing that sounds great, but something just feels off, trust what you feel. If you get an uneasy feeling from emailing a potential landlord or feel that something just isn\u2019t right, do NOT follow through.   If it sounds too good to be true\u2026 it is.  If a fully furnished, 2-bedroom apartment is for rent in the West Village in a luxury, high-rise, doorman building for $500, it most likely isn\u2019t real.     Never wire money overseas or send cash.  Many scammers prefer not to meet their victims face to face. Instead, the owner (read: scammer) will \u201cunfortunately\u201d be out of town, or out of the country. You\u2019ll be asked to wire them the funds via Western Union or MoneyGram, and then you\u2019ll never hear from them again. Only hand over money once you\u2019ve physically been to the address and physically been inside the apartment with an agent.     Deal Locally.  Only deal locally or with people that you can meet in person - follow this one simple rule and you will avoid 99% of the scam attempts. If they cannot meet with you, that should raise a red flag. Make sure you have a phone number and even an office location that you can verify with the person showing you the apartment.     FAKE CASHIER CHECKS &amp; MONEY ORDERS ARE COMMON, and BANKS WILL CASH THEM AND THEN HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE when the fake is discovered weeks later.   Most websites are not accountable.  Unless it is specifically stated on their website, most websites are NOT INVOLVED IN ANY TRANSACTION, and do not handle payments, guarantee transactions, vet properties or listers, provide escrow services, or offer &quot;buyer protection&quot; or &quot;seller certification\u201d. If you are scammed, websites are not likely to reimburse you or take responsibility. They are simply providing a means to which information can be shared.     Never give out financial information.  Never send anyone a bank account number, social security number, eBay/PayPal info, etc. AVOID DEALS INVOLVING SHIPPING OR ESCROW SERVICES and know that ONLY A SCAMMER WILL &quot;GUARANTEE&quot; YOUR TRANSACTION.   Recognizing scams.  Key words in a scam advertisement: inquiry from someone far away, often in another country, Western Union, Money Gram, cashier's check, money order, cash only, shipping, escrow service, or a &quot;guarantee&quot;inability or refusal to meet face-to-face before consumating transaction, no phone number or physical location of an office.     New York City is a much safer place. Be smart about your decision, don't feel pushed or rushed into it, and again, trust your feelings. If by chance you happen to be a victim of a scam, then call the police and report it as soon as possible. If you pulled a listing off a website, notify the website owner as well so others don't become a victim.

If you would like to rent a room in your apartment, we define that as a SHARE in the database - please list it as such, not as an &quot;Apartment&quot;.   Include the exact address of the apartment, including apartment number.   Include your full name and contact information.   Each listing is reviewed prior to posting. Any listings that do not follow the guidelines above will not be posted.     Should we receive complaints about your listings, your listings privileges may be denied.
