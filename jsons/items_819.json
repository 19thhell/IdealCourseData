How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals.

How can the literary   imagination reflect and transform geographic and cosmographic   technology? How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence.

Through close and critical readings of primary texts we will ask how certain themes (e.g. justice, truth, love, desire, writing, persuasion) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves throughout the period. Throughout our study we will hold gender as a guiding question, asking how the texts deploy gender as an organizing principle and how conceptions of gender are thereby produced and consolidated in them. Authors include Homer, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Horace, Longinus, and various recent commentators.        Cities on Edge: The Megalopolis of the Global South in Chronicle, Fiction and Film    Dopico      This course surveys the life of six cities from the global South whose identities,  culture, politics, and everyday life have been shaped by massive growth, urban  migration, global and local uneven development. Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Rio De Janeiro/Sao Paulo, Cairo, and Mumbai/Bombay  have a long history of grand ambitions and grand inequities, modern  transformations and modern dislocations, and each reveals a specific national  and political context. This course will  be devoted to their recent past. Through  literature, non-fiction, and film, we will consider how these cities live on  the double-edge of hyper-modernity and  urban viability, falling under that evocative rubric of megalopolis. We will  look back at modernization, massive growth, and political upheaval. Through novels and reportage and cinema, we  will examine how these cities have amassed financial and cultural capital and  produced an impressive cultural archive, while at the same time engulfing  millions of human beings who live beyond the margins of poverty. In these slums, poblaciones and favelas mass  urban migrations have created shadow cities that serve as a negative for the  rationalized landscapes of metropolitan growth. These  populations are excluded from the democratizing opportunities of metropolitan  life, but they have transformed the idea and the identity of the city, and the  way that city-dwellers live, define, and imagine their  lives in the megalopolis. The  contemporary megalopolis and its precursor, the metropolitan capital,  hold an extraordinary prominence in the imaginaries of modernity and  postmodernity, and we will turn to representations of urban life in journalism,  essay, non-fiction chronicles, literature, and cinema. Our coursework and  our discussions will cut across inter-disciplinary lines to establish a  responsible context for each city. While  we will concentrate on the lives of these megalopoli, we will begin by  reflecting on the city as a function of the modern imaginary and on the city\u2019s  indispensable connection to notions of nation and modernity. We will  also consider how the social, political and economic conditions that shape the  narratives and popular fictions of the metropolis are grounded in diversities  and inequities common to other cities of  the global South (like Cit\u00e9 Soleil, Nairobi, Habana,etc.)         Topics in 20th Century Literature: Transnational America    Garcia    Beginning with  Randolph Bourne's \u201cTrans-National America\u201d (1916), this seminar explores the  transnational dimensions of 20th century American literature. Concentrating  on distinct moments in U.S. literary history, including the Harlem Renaissance  era, the Second World War, and the post 9/11 period, we consider different spatial  meanings attached to \u201cAmerica\u201d by moving chronologically from the early twentieth-century  to the early twenty-first. Throughout, we examine cultural  and intellectual histories that bear on our readings and juxtapose historical  artifacts with literary texts. Themes include literary treatments of  racialization and ethnicization; national belonging as cultural politics; and  divergent figurative and renderings of the U.S. during the \u201cAmerican Century.\u201d Readings  include works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, W. E. B. Du Bois,  Pietro di Donato, Richard Wright, and Saul Bellow, among others.          Junior Theory Seminar: Texts and Its Meaning    Iampolski    This class explores the question 'where does meaning come from?\" and other topics such as the ontological theory of meaning, sophistics, stoics, on corporeals, hermeneutics, and more. Readings include Kafka, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, Heidegger, Sartre, Deleuze, Yuri Olesha, Paul Ricoeur, Kant, Shklovksy, and more.        Texts and Ideas: Animal Humans    Lezra    \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway.        Art Before the Law: Busted! Drugs, Law and Literature    Ronell    The relation to drugs, complex and often covert, has been under-theorized and is still in many ways disavowed. Is there such a thing as a truly drug-free zone in the realms of thinking, the sacred, or in the domains of artistic and musical articulation? We will conduct a sober exploration of the addictive qualities that contour modern literature, philosophy, and cultural formations. Ranging from Nietzsche to Freud to Heidegger and Derrida, from Thomas de Quincey to Flaubert as well as contemporary fiction, poetry (and music), we will examine the intoxicated states on which thought and the poetic word may well rely. The relation of the addicted subject to law will serve as a focal point. The notion of dependency will be deconstructed. Expect a sustained intellectual high!        Colonialism &amp; the Rise of Modern African Literature: South African Literature After Apartheid    Sanders    For more than 40 years, apartheid provided the critical  frame of reference for South African literature, as writers lent their pens to  opposing (and in certain cases defending) the system of racial separation and  white minority rule. What has become of South African literature in the years  after 1994, the year after the country\u2019s first non-racial elections? To what  extent have writers imagined a South Africa different from the one they  inherited? In this course we will explore, among other things, the influence of  the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on prose, poetry and drama of the late  1990s, the response of writers to the xenophobic violence of 2008, as well as  allied developments in the animated films of William Kentridge, and the music  videos of Die Antwoord (The Answer), Spoek Mathambo and others. Authors to  include, among others, J.M. Coetzee, Antjie Krog, and Phaswane Mpe. Readings  will be in English and/or in translation from Afrikaans and Zulu.
