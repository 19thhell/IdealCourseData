ANYONE ENROLLED IN SUMMER NURSING CLASSES MAY NOT APPLY   Application Deadline: April 30th for summer 2015   The Urban Health Care Program offers nursing students a full-time, paid, summer externship at a primary-care community health care setting in Manhattan. The program, through the generous support of the Louis and Rachel Rudin Foundation Inc., has been in existence since 1988 and provides an invaluable experience to nursing students while meeting the health care needs of underserved and marginalized communities.   The eight-week program begins in late June and runs through early August. The goal of the program is to teach students about primary care of under-served urban populations in community-based settings. This program also provides opportunities to work with other disciplines through inter-professional practice in community agencies. Students will collaborate on projects that include history taking, assessments, research surveys, and consumer education projects. Past student participants have reported that the program provided them with increased awareness of community services, the needs of under-served and marginalized communities and the benefits of collaborating with medical students and community service agencies to decrease disparities in health care.   Each student works in an agency with an agency mentor, who provides guidance in assigning health-related work and projects. The students work 4 1/2 days per week with half a day being spent in team meetings/presentations with other students and faculty members. The faculty is available by phone at all times.   Selection criteria: 1. Minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 2. Completed Adult &amp; Elder Nursing II (NURSE-UN 1241) 3. Students must be continuing in Fall 2015 (i.e., May 2015 graduates are not eligible.)   Application Procedure: Students interested in applying for this summer externship are required to submit: 1. A cover letter with a brief description of themselves, a list of learning objectives/goals for their experience, how this might contribute to their career goals, and a description of past relevant experiences. 2.

Genomics is the study of all genes in the human genome and their interactions with the environment as well as various psychosocial and cultural influences. Genetics and genomics have been recognized as important components of the scientific foundation of health care. This course will focus on developing genetic and genomic competencies from an interdisciplinary perspective. Content will focus on new ways of thinking about health and disease in relation to genetics and genomics, including the associated ethical, social, legal, cultural, political, and professional implications for health care. The impact of genetics and genomics on health promotion, disease prevention, risk reduction, treatment, and nursing responsibilities will be discussed.
