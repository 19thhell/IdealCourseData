The two-year program provides students with private studios and access to facilities in painting, printmaking, ceramics, photography, digital media, and sculpture.    Description    The program has no restrictions on media, and students are encouraged to work with whatever formal means are best suited to their ideas. During the course of study, students engage in a team-taught interdisciplinary critique class each semester, as well as one full afternoon each week of individual studio meetings with visiting artists, critics and full-time and visiting faculty. Students study with faculty who are acclaimed artists, critics, and writers with diverse interests and disciplines who see teaching as an integral part of an ongoing and influential creative practice. Drawn from the surrounding New York art-world, yet deeply engaged with their students, the relationship between the faculty and students represents the core of the MFA community. The MFA studios are located in the Art Department&rsquo;s six-story Beaux-Arts Building at 34 Stuyvesant Street in the East Village. The building also houses facilities for painting, sculpture, photography, computer art, video, performance, ceramics, metalsmithing, sewing, and printmaking. All studios, shops, and labs are available to MFA students and courses may be taken in any of these areas.  The Visiting Artist Lecture Series is held each Thursday evening following the afternoon studio visits. Lectures are open to the public and visitors are welcome. MFA Students plan Open Studio events that can combine performances, festivities, and exhibitions.  MFA Thesis Exhibitions are held in late spring at the Art Department&rsquo;s 80WSE Gallery. During their final semester, students select a committee of three artists or critics to work with them during the final stages of their exhibition and written thesis. (Note: 80WSE Gallery was included by Jerry Saltz on Vulture and in New York Magazine as one of The 19 Best Art Shows of 2014 in NYC.)    Program Goals and Mission    The MFA program is dedicated to assisting student artists in developing their work via an approach that is intensely introspective while collectively open to the challenges and issues of the larger world. The program asks students to consider, both critically and irreverently, their own practices and assumptions, as well as those of the contemporary art world, and to pursue their visions to the point of excess as needed. Designed to be small, the program provides ample opportunity for individual attention and critique. The program is non-restrictive to encourage students to work with whatever media or formal means are best suited to their ideas.    Student Learning Outcomes    Students will:       Analyze and examine the process of artistic production through guidance and critique with faculty, visiting artists, curators and critics.    Develop critical thinking as it applies to the conceptual and aesthetic foundation of individual studio practice.    Communicate clearly and effectively both verbally and in writing the link between theory and individual artistic practice with specific attention to historical and cultural contexts.    Synthesize critique and intellectual reflection into individual artistic production culminating in a thesis exhibition of contemporary and critical relevance.

As borders between media shift, contemporary sculpture and installation work may include new uses of video, ceramics, architecture, fabric, drawing, or performance, as well as classic skills such as woodworking, welding, or moldmaking.    The sculpture facility covers a full floor of the Barney building. It is divided into a wood and metal shop which includes a panel saw, Sawstop table saw, compound miter saw, vertical and horizontal bandsaws for both metal/woodworking, an air compressor system and downdraft table for sanding. In addition, we have a 800 sq/ft critique space for the presentation of student art work, as well as a plaster and moldmaking studio with a self contained spray booth room. Shop technicians are available for information and oversight of the studio. The sculpture faculty includes Area Director Sue De Beer, Beverly Semmes, Rico Gatson, Curtis Mitchell, Dave Hardy, Ian Cooper, and other innovative practitioners.    Craft Sculpture: Ceramics, Metalsmithing, Fabric, and Glass    The renewed connection between fine arts and craft media has become the focus of a new cross-disciplinary movement in contemporary art. Courses in ceramics, mixed media sculpture, metalsmithing, jewelry, and sewn fabrics allow artists to expand their ideas and practices through a wide range of materials and skills in the Art Department&rsquo;s studio facilities. Through a unique liaison with Urban Glass, the largest facility in the world dedicated to glass as an art form, students can expand their creative vocabulary in this medium, as well. Area Director Judith Schwartz is on of the world&rsquo;s leading authors and curators in ceramics.

Digital Fabrication Studio     The Digital Fabrication Studio is a multidisciplinary hackerspace equipped to explore new media and design. The studio houses iMac and PC computers, an Epilog Helix 24 Laser Engraver, Makerbot and Formlabs 3D printers, a full range of electronics prototyping equipment and hardware, a CNC plotter and access to a Shopbot Desktop CNC router. HD projection and HD television allow instructors and students to share, explore and adapt to the rapid cultural and technological innovation the world faces today.    Painting and Drawing    The skills of painting and drawing enable the artist-student to transform ideas, be they internal or external, to the planarity of a piece of paper or canvas. This process of converting thoughts and signs into visually accessible shapes is complex and, at times, very direct. For this reason, painting and drawing will always be considered by many to be at the heart and soul of the visual arts.    The recent resurgence of interest in traditional hand made media speaks to many issues in contemporary life, and the demand for courses in these areas is higher than ever. Our painting and drawing faculty, led by Area Director Maureen Gallace, with the support of John Torreano, Jesse Bransford, Ross Bleckner, Peter Rostovsky, and Jason Tomme reflects the broad range of acclaimed artists working in classical materials.    Print    Print provides contemporary artists with a extensive array of possibilities and working methods, from photocopy to etching to digital 3-D printing, from unique to multiple to installation. The NYU Print Studio is dedicated to an environment where this range is encouraged along with experimentation and personal exploration.    The print studio, with 14' high ceilings and northern light, is equipped to realize ideas in multiple techniques, including silkscreen (photo-process darkroom), etching (two Charles Brand etching presses), relief print, book arts and letterpress (Vandercook UNI-1 press), digital imaging/printing (Epson 4900 Archival Printer, Epson scanner, AccuRIP software, Xante PostScript large formate laser printer), as well as Departmental facilities for laser cutting and 3-D printing. New York City at large provides a unique context for the study of print, which includes numerous special print exhibitions, vast museum collections, the annual New York City Print Week, and a vibrant diy, zine, and street art scene. The print area faculty, led by Area Head Mark Johnson, includes Kiki Smith, Valerie Hammond, Noah Breuer, and Ruby Sky Stiler.    Environmental Activism    Faculty member Natalie Jeremijenko, one of the most visible and dynamic forces working at the intersection of art, technology, engineering, and environmental studies, has established the Environmental Health Clinic, a laboratory to diagnose environmental ills and create prescriptions for a greener tomorrow. Working with designers, gardeners, and computer scientists, Jeremikenko, who is herself an engineer as well as an artist, is establishing a cross-disciplinary team of artists and researchers to contribute to a slate of poetic and political project                        This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;        by New York University.
