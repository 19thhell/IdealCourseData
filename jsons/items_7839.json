This mission requires that scientists and engineers be integrated with practicing radiologists and connected to clinicians in a wide range of specialties, in order to understand key unsolved problems and unmet clinical needs, and ultimately to implement solutions with a real impact for clinical medicine.   It also requires radiologists who appreciate how new technical developments can improve their day-to-day practice, and who take the time to work with developers in evaluating the efficacy of new approaches and determining key next steps.   It requires a collaborative environment in which new methods and devices can be evaluated rapidly to improve the care of actual patients.

This mission requires that scientists and engineers be integrated with practicing radiologists and connected to clinicians in a wide range of specialties, in order to understand key unsolved problems and unmet clinical needs, and ultimately to implement solutions with a real impact for clinical medicine.   It also requires radiologists who appreciate how new technical developments can improve their day-to-day practice, and who take the time to work with developers in evaluating the efficacy of new approaches and determining key next steps.   It requires a collaborative environment in which new methods and devices can be evaluated rapidly to improve the care of actual patients.   And it requires coordination with industry to ensure that the best methods, after thorough comparison and evaluation, are adopted not only at our institution but on imaging systems worldwide.
