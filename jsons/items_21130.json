This is just one chilling anecdote in Dale Jamieson \u2019s new book, Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle Against Climate Change Failed\u2014and What It Means for Our Future , which provides a comprehensive history of the denial and political paralysis that have prevented us from putting a stop to global warming (a phenomenon, Jamieson reveals, mainstream magazines were covering as early as the 1950s). \u201cAs a result of climate change,\u201d he writes, \u201cthere will be massive extinctions of plants and animals, rising seas will engulf major cities and entire nations, and \u2018natural\u2019 disasters including droughts, heat waves, and storms will raise havoc with virtually all aspects of life.\u201d   Yep, that bleak future is our doing; we have failed our descendants.

Be sure also to catch his lecture here on April 22.   \u2014Eileen Reynolds                               Dale Jamieson         In your book you report that global warming was mentioned by President Johnson in a speech to Congress in 1965. Why has it taken so long to address the issue?  We have to separate a little the arc of the conversation about the environment generally from conversation about climate change. For the environment generally, a big change happens with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. He was running on an anti-regulation platform and particularly in his first term he appointed some militantly anti-environmentalist people to various cabinet positions. That really put the brake on the movement.   But one of the themes of my book is that climate change from the beginning is an odd issue that doesn\u2019t fall very neatly into any categories. Initially, it wasn\u2019t championed by environmental groups. One reason is that from the point of view of the 1970s and the 1980s, it looked like nuclear power would be one of the attractive policy options to respond to climate change, and the environmental movement was really very strongly anti-nuclear power. So it wasn\u2019t a very attractive issue that way. Also, a lot of our thinking about policy tends to be oriented around a sort of good guy-bad guy polarization. Climate change is an issue that doesn\u2019t fit very neatly into that stereotype. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest collective action problem, where we\u2019re all involved in contributing to the problem to some extent and we\u2019re all involved in suffering from the problem to some extent.   How did the public debate over this topic become so hostile?  This is part of why the book is called Reason in a Dark Time . People like me, who grew up in the 1950s and the 1960s, came up in a world in which we thought that reason was neutral. Republicans, Democrats\u2014well-meaning people of whatever stripe\u2014might disagree about solutions to problems, but they wouldn\u2019t think of science as an enemy.   President Nixon, a Republican, created the EPA and signed the Endangered Species Act and many of the first-generation environmental laws. He may or may not have been as enthusiastic about environmental regulation as some other politicians, but he didn\u2019t stand up on his hind feet and scream in the face of science. But since then something has happened to American politics, where people now somehow think of science as partisan. If you don\u2019t like environmental regulation, then instead of thinking about what alternatives there are, you just sort of deny reality. And that\u2019s really counter to the whole idea of the Enlightenment\u2014the idea that through the use of science, through coming to know more about the world, we\u2019ll improve the lives of most people.   You write that democratic governments may not be equipped to confront climate change. How can this be?  The great revolutionary 18th-century idea of democracy was that everybody who is affected by an action should take part in deciding whether to take that action. But the problem now, when it comes to something like climate change, is that many of those who are affected by the political decisions that a community makes are not represented in that political community itself.   Take future generations: We\u2019ve already changed the climate in ways that will affect people for the next thousand years, but those people are not represented in this decision-making. When a country like the United States, for example, emits very high levels of gases that will adversely affect people in countries like Bangladesh, who don\u2019t really do much emitting, they have no role in the decision-making process that goes on here in the U.S. And then there\u2019s non-human nature: Climate change is going to drive many species to extinction, but they\u2019re not part of any kind of community that makes decisions about how to organize the economic life of the planet. So it seems pretty reasonable to ask whether that kind of a political system is adequate for making decisions that have really long-term effects.   Many of us feel ashamed about not living greener lives, but is that vague sense of guilt enough to make us change our behavior?  I started thinking about this one day when I was sitting in New York and I got an invitation to fly across the world to Perth, Australia, to give one lecture about climate ethics. I thought to myself, what I\u2019m going to do is be responsible for the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions that a hundred people in Bangladesh do in a year just so that I can fly to Australia to tell a bunch of people like me that it\u2019s wrong to do what I just did to get there to tell them that. That\u2019s a kind of Jon Stewart irony moment. But if I really think it\u2019s morally wrong to emit this carbon, what I feel should be not just that this is stupid, silly, and self-indulgent, but that I\u2019m a murderer, because I\u2019m emitting carbon that causes all this damage. But not even I\u2014someone who\u2019s been working for this issue for 30 years!\u2014really feels like a murderer when I do that.   That\u2019s when it dawned on me that the kind of common-sense morality that we grow up with, that\u2019s written onto our brains by the time we\u2019re adults, just doesn\u2019t extend to this kind of a problem. We can intellectually convince ourselves that we shouldn\u2019t do things like that, but we\u2019re not going to feel it the way that we feel the wrongness of intentionally lying to someone or stealing their bicycle.   Isn\u2019t it also just tough for people to grasp that climate change is really happening?  Yes, and one piece of that just has to do with how we\u2019re wired up in terms of our perception. We\u2019re highly visual creatures, and we tend to respond really strongly to visual stimuli that we don\u2019t like. And the main gas that\u2019s changing climate? Well, it\u2019s invisible, tasteless, odorless\u2014it doesn\u2019t present to our visual systems. Now imagine that carbon dioxide was a color. Suppose it was really disgusting yellowish green, and you could see that coming out of factories and cars. Then we\u2019d associate that color with the damage that climate change causes and we\u2019d be a lot more likely to respond to it.   If the efforts we make now won\u2019t be able to reverse the substantial environmental changes already set in motion, why not just give up?  Part of what gives life meaning is being able to control things in the world and contribute to change. But the other thing that gives life meaning is really living in accordance with some values. I don\u2019t mean to hold myself up as an exemplar of anything, because I do things like get on airplanes and fly to the other side of the world to give lectures, but mostly I ride my bike. And I don\u2019t think that riding my bike is going to prevent climate change, but I do feel that it puts me on the side of people who want to do what they can to slow this down. In that sense, it\u2019s living in accordance with my values. In a lot of ways that\u2019s the most important thing about green consumerism. [It\u2019s] not going to save the planet, it\u2019s not going to stop climate change. But in so far as it really is an expression of people\u2019s character, and their ideals, and what they want the world to be, then it is part of living a meaningful life.   So living green is almost like a devotional practice?  I wouldn\u2019t reject that. I might prefer the language of spirituality to the language of religion, but it\u2019s true.

I don\u2019t mean to hold myself up as an exemplar of anything, because I do things like get on airplanes and fly to the other side of the world to give lectures, but mostly I ride my bike. And I don\u2019t think that riding my bike is going to prevent climate change, but I do feel that it puts me on the side of people who want to do what they can to slow this down. In that sense, it\u2019s living in accordance with my values. In a lot of ways that\u2019s the most important thing about green consumerism. [It\u2019s] not going to save the planet, it\u2019s not going to stop climate change. But in so far as it really is an expression of people\u2019s character, and their ideals, and what they want the world to be, then it is part of living a meaningful life.   So living green is almost like a devotional practice?  I wouldn\u2019t reject that. I might prefer the language of spirituality to the language of religion, but it\u2019s true.

It emphasizes integrated, problem-oriented study and a broad range of courses across disciplines and schools.    Biology  The Biology department offers students the opportunity to explore the various areas of current biology in an integrated yet diverse program that builds from a solid foundation of the basic elements of molecular and cellular biology, genetics, evolution, organ systems, and population studies. The department also offers a series of discrete minors in the life sciences, specifically in the areas of molecular and cell biology, genetics, genomics and bioinformatics, and environmental biology.    Animal Studies Initiative  The Animal Studies Initiative promotes and supports research and teaching in the emerging area of Animal Studies. It does so by administering an undergraduate minor in Animal Studies, supporting research and teaching, and sponsoring public events and workshops.    Graduate   Bioethics   The program promotes a broad conception of bioethics encompassing both medical and environmental ethics through conferences, workshops, public lectures, and graduate courses.    Center on Environmental and Land Use Law (NYU School of Law)  This center emphasizes legal research and problem-solving in three principal subject areas: Environmental Regulation, International Environmental Law and Sustainable Development, and Land Use Law and Regulation.    Environmental Conservation Education (NYU Steinhardt)   An intensive interdisciplinary MA program that involves students in a consideration of social, philosophical, political, and educational perspectives on the environment. The ECE program is the oldest graduate program in environmental studies in the U.S. with a foundation in environmental philosophy rather than science.   Master of Urban Planning (NYU Wagner)   This program not only provides students with an understanding of the economic, technological and social forces that shape metropolitan areas at home and abroad, it also equips them with the tools needed to confront the key challenges facing urban communities across the globe.    Certificate in Sustainable Design, Construction, and Development (SCPS Schack Institute of Real Estate)  This certificate program was created to clear a career path for those interested in equipping themselves to serve a vital public purpose and master an invaluable field of knowledge for future real estate practice.    CUSP (Center for Urban Science and Progress)  The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) is a unique public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory and classroom to help cities around the world become more productive, livable, equitable, and resilient. CUSP observes, analyzes, and models cities to optimize outcomes, prototype new solutions, formalize new tools and processes, and develop new expertise/experts. These activities will make CUSP the world's leading authority in the emerging field of \"Urban Informatics.\"     Other programs with elective courses that focus on environmental issues:    Individualized Concentrations (NYU Gallatin)   Though Gallatin does not offer a degree with an explicit environmental focus, its interdisciplinary, individualized undergraduate and graduate degree programs have often lent themselves to environmental study. Students have access to courses across several different NYU schools, and many choose to develop sustainability-related concentrations by combining resources throughout the university. Gallatin itself also offers several environment-focused courses.    Interactive Telecommunications Program (NYU Tisch)   ITP challenges students to apply their creativity and imagination to the latest digital tools and techniques and push the boundaries of interactivity in the real and digital worlds. The development and use of interactive technologies can place heavy demand on our environment, but on the other hand, these technologies can be used to make a positive impact as well. Several sustainable design and renewable energy-related courses are offered.    Master of Science in Global Affairs (SCPS)  This M.S. Program offers a context for understanding critical issues in international politics, economics, dispute settlement, law, human rights, energy, the environment, and related areas. The program's environmental courses focus on global warming and natural resources.    Science, Health &amp; Environmental Reporting (NYU Arts and Sciences, Journalism)  SHERP is a 16- month graduate-level science journalism program. It emphasizes intensive training in research, reporting and writing as well as immersion in a wide range of cutting-edge scientific issues, from genetics to global climate change.    Department of Environmental Medicine (NYU Medicine)  One of the nation's oldest and foremost centers for research into the health effects of environmental pollution. Research divisions include Biostatistics, Human Exposure and Health Effects, and Epidemiology. The department offers a graduate program in Environmental Health Science.    Food Studies  Food Studies offers an interdisciplinary approach to the study of food as a bio-cultural system focused on the urban environment.    Other Programs and Initiatives    Environmental Health Clinic  The Environmental Health Clinic at NYU is a clinic and lab, modeled on other health clinics at universities. However the project approaches health from an understanding of its dependence on external local environments; rather than on the internal biology and genetic predispositions of an individual.    Center for the Sustainable Built Environment (NYU SCPS)   The Center for the Sustainable Built Environment (SBE) at the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate fills the critical need to improve decision-making and sustainable practices in real estate and construction industries. The goal of SBE is to foster innovation in building technologies, public policies, and financial and regulatory mechanisms that will accelerate and expand the deployment of sustainable practices in the real estate and construction industries.    New York City Accelerator for a Clean and Renewable Economy (ACRE) (NYU-Poly)  The New York City Accelerator for a Clean and Renewable Economy (NYC ACRE) helps clean technology and renewable energy companies in New York City grow, advancing the City as a role model for environmental sustainability and smart growth. NYC ACRE is seeded by a four year, $1.6M grant from the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority (NYSERDA) to NYU-Poly aimed at growing an ecosystem of entrepreneurs, international companies, and innovative local businesses that are providing solutions to climate and energy issues while growing the cleantech/renewable energy sector and creating jobs in NYC.    Wallerstein Collaborative for Urban Environmental Education (NYU Steinhardt)  The Collaborative provides a year-round program which stimulates public school teachers in the metropolitan New York City region to bring environmental education into the classroom. The Collaborative also provides increased environmental education opportunities for pre-service teachers through direct experience in the urban environment.    GLOBAL Design NYU  GLOBAL Design NYU has as its mission to bring together current designers, educators, and innovators who are clustered in certain locations, but whose work is far-reaching in outlook. The GLOBAL Design lecture series are comprised to showcase potent innovation processes as it relates to visionary architecture, urbanism, ecological planning, and how this process of innovation ties to education.    Marron Institute  New York University's Marron Institute on Cities and the Urban Environment is an interdisciplinary and international effort to advance vital new research and teaching on cities and the urban environment.    Institute for Public Knowledge  The Institute for Public Knowledge (IPK) brings theoretically serious scholarship to bear on major public issues. Located at NYU, it nurtures collaboration among social researchers in New York and around the world. It builds bridges between university-based researchers and organizations pursuing practical action. It supports communication between researchers and broader publics. And it examines transformations in the public sphere, social science, and the university as a social institution as these change the conditions for public knowledge.

Why We Just Don't 'Get' Climate Change                       How\u2019s this for government foresight? A scientist who warned Washington policy-makers back in the 1960s of harmful carbon dioxide doubling just 50 years down the road was told to come back with an update\u2014 in 49 years .                               This is just one chilling anecdote in Dale Jamieson \u2019s new book, Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle Against Climate Change Failed\u2014and What It Means for Our Future , which provides a comprehensive history of the denial and political paralysis that have prevented us from putting a stop to global warming (a phenomenon, Jamieson reveals, mainstream magazines were covering as early as the 1950s). \u201cAs a result of climate change,\u201d he writes, \u201cthere will be massive extinctions of plants and animals, rising seas will engulf major cities and entire nations, and \u2018natural\u2019 disasters including droughts, heat waves, and storms will raise havoc with virtually all aspects of life.\u201d   Yep, that bleak future is our doing; we have failed our descendants. On this point, the NYU Professor of Environmental Studies and Philosophy, Affiliated Professor of Law, and Director of the Animal Studies Initiative is very clear. And yet he spends little time dwelling on missed opportunities, instead devoting much of the book to why \u201cit still matters what we do.\u201d   Jamieson offers some concrete policy recommendations and calls for a more focused discussion about experimental technologies that could artificially cool the planet. \u201cWe will have to abandon the Promethean dream of a certain, decisive solution and instead engage with the messy world of temporary victories and local solutions while a new world comes into focus,\u201d he writes. And yet most compelling are his thought experiments that challenge us to consider climate change as a moral problem as well as a scientific one.   A few days before Earth Day, NYU Stories caught up with Jamieson for what turned out to be a surprisingly uplifting conversation about ethics in an apocalyptic age\u2014an edited version of which appears below. Be sure also to catch his lecture here on April 22.   \u2014Eileen Reynolds                               Dale Jamieson         In your book you report that global warming was mentioned by President Johnson in a speech to Congress in 1965. Why has it taken so long to address the issue?  We have to separate a little the arc of the conversation about the environment generally from conversation about climate change. For the environment generally, a big change happens with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. He was running on an anti-regulation platform and particularly in his first term he appointed some militantly anti-environmentalist people to various cabinet positions. That really put the brake on the movement.   But one of the themes of my book is that climate change from the beginning is an odd issue that doesn\u2019t fall very neatly into any categories. Initially, it wasn\u2019t championed by environmental groups. One reason is that from the point of view of the 1970s and the 1980s, it looked like nuclear power would be one of the attractive policy options to respond to climate change, and the environmental movement was really very strongly anti-nuclear power. So it wasn\u2019t a very attractive issue that way. Also, a lot of our thinking about policy tends to be oriented around a sort of good guy-bad guy polarization. Climate change is an issue that doesn\u2019t fit very neatly into that stereotype. It\u2019s the world\u2019s biggest collective action problem, where we\u2019re all involved in contributing to the problem to some extent and we\u2019re all involved in suffering from the problem to some extent.   How did the public debate over this topic become so hostile?  This is part of why the book is called Reason in a Dark Time . People like me, who grew up in the 1950s and the 1960s, came up in a world in which we thought that reason was neutral. Republicans, Democrats\u2014well-meaning people of whatever stripe\u2014might disagree about solutions to problems, but they wouldn\u2019t think of science as an enemy.   President Nixon, a Republican, created the EPA and signed the Endangered Species Act and many of the first-generation environmental laws. He may or may not have been as enthusiastic about environmental regulation as some other politicians, but he didn\u2019t stand up on his hind feet and scream in the face of science. But since then something has happened to American politics, where people now somehow think of science as partisan. If you don\u2019t like environmental regulation, then instead of thinking about what alternatives there are, you just sort of deny reality. And that\u2019s really counter to the whole idea of the Enlightenment\u2014the idea that through the use of science, through coming to know more about the world, we\u2019ll improve the lives of most people.   You write that democratic governments may not be equipped to confront climate change. How can this be?  The great revolutionary 18th-century idea of democracy was that everybody who is affected by an action should take part in deciding whether to take that action. But the problem now, when it comes to something like climate change, is that many of those who are affected by the political decisions that a community makes are not represented in that political community itself.   Take future generations: We\u2019ve already changed the climate in ways that will affect people for the next thousand years, but those people are not represented in this decision-making. When a country like the United States, for example, emits very high levels of gases that will adversely affect people in countries like Bangladesh, who don\u2019t really do much emitting, they have no role in the decision-making process that goes on here in the U.S. And then there\u2019s non-human nature: Climate change is going to drive many species to extinction, but they\u2019re not part of any kind of community that makes decisions about how to organize the economic life of the planet. So it seems pretty reasonable to ask whether that kind of a political system is adequate for making decisions that have really long-term effects.   Many of us feel ashamed about not living greener lives, but is that vague sense of guilt enough to make us change our behavior?  I started thinking about this one day when I was sitting in New York and I got an invitation to fly across the world to Perth, Australia, to give one lecture about climate ethics. I thought to myself, what I\u2019m going to do is be responsible for the same amount of greenhouse gas emissions that a hundred people in Bangladesh do in a year just so that I can fly to Australia to tell a bunch of people like me that it\u2019s wrong to do what I just did to get there to tell them that. That\u2019s a kind of Jon Stewart irony moment. But if I really think it\u2019s morally wrong to emit this carbon, what I feel should be not just that this is stupid, silly, and self-indulgent, but that I\u2019m a murderer, because I\u2019m emitting carbon that causes all this damage. But not even I\u2014someone who\u2019s been working for this issue for 30 years!\u2014really feels like a murderer when I do that.   That\u2019s when it dawned on me that the kind of common-sense morality that we grow up with, that\u2019s written onto our brains by the time we\u2019re adults, just doesn\u2019t extend to this kind of a problem. We can intellectually convince ourselves that we shouldn\u2019t do things like that, but we\u2019re not going to feel it the way that we feel the wrongness of intentionally lying to someone or stealing their bicycle.   Isn\u2019t it also just tough for people to grasp that climate change is really happening?  Yes, and one piece of that just has to do with how we\u2019re wired up in terms of our perception. We\u2019re highly visual creatures, and we tend to respond really strongly to visual stimuli that we don\u2019t like. And the main gas that\u2019s changing climate? Well, it\u2019s invisible, tasteless, odorless\u2014it doesn\u2019t present to our visual systems. Now imagine that carbon dioxide was a color. Suppose it was really disgusting yellowish green, and you could see that coming out of factories and cars. Then we\u2019d associate that color with the damage that climate change causes and we\u2019d be a lot more likely to respond to it.   If the efforts we make now won\u2019t be able to reverse the substantial environmental changes already set in motion, why not just give up?  Part of what gives life meaning is being able to control things in the world and contribute to change. But the other thing that gives life meaning is really living in accordance with some values. I don\u2019t mean to hold myself up as an exemplar of anything, because I do things like get on airplanes and fly to the other side of the world to give lectures, but mostly I ride my bike. And I don\u2019t think that riding my bike is going to prevent climate change, but I do feel that it puts me on the side of people who want to do what they can to slow this down. In that sense, it\u2019s living in accordance with my values. In a lot of ways that\u2019s the most important thing about green consumerism. [It\u2019s] not going to save the planet, it\u2019s not going to stop climate change. But in so far as it really is an expression of people\u2019s character, and their ideals, and what they want the world to be, then it is part of living a meaningful life.   So living green is almost like a devotional practice?  I wouldn\u2019t reject that. I might prefer the language of spirituality to the language of religion, but it\u2019s true.
