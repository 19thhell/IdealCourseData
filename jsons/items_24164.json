Waksler, 1991]    Chapter 2    Beyond Socialization   Frances Chaput Waksler         Introduction    The purpose of this chapter is to set forth some major criticisms that can be made of the concept of socialization as it is formulated and used by sociologists. To identify problems is not necessarily to provide resolutions, but clearly it is a fundamental step in that process.   The Bergers' description of socialization was chosen for inclusion as Chapter 1 and for criticism in this chapter because theirs is a particularly sophisticated introductory treatment. While they avoid the pitfalls inherent in overly simplified presentations, the very clarity of their work sets in relief problematic aspects of the concept of socialization. Such problems characterize virtually all introductory treatments (see for example, Robertson, 1989 and Vander Zanden 1990). In this chapter, the specific criticisms to be put forth center around two general features of socialization: the concept itself and its range.     The Concept Itself    Is socialization the name for an identifiable and documentable process whose existence is subject to proof or refutation, or is it rather the name for an assumption made to organize a wide range of activities? Either can prove useful to understanding but they are in no sense interchangeable. What follows is not dependent upon either answer to the question posed, though the ideas presented lead towards the conclusion that the concept of socialization names an assumption rather than an empirically verifiable process. (In Chapter 3, Mackay argues that the concept as it is currently constituted is not a sociological concept at all but merely an everyday adult view of children.)     The Range of the Concept    In the Sociological literature, studies of socialization have focused extensively on children and the study of children has been conducted primarily in terms of socialization. As a consequence socialization of children and of adults have been conceived of as different rather than similar processes as evidenced for example in the distinction between initial and secondary socialization. Children's activities unrelated to socialization have been until quite recently minimally investigated by sociologists. The range of the concept of socialization can thus be said to be both too narrow (when it focuses only on children) and too broad (when it serves as the major way to understand children) .   In what follows I first discuss an important distinction sociologists make between initial and secondary socialization, a topic touched upon in the previous chapter. This distinction assumes the existence of clear differences between adults and children and obscures similarities. Next I consider Dennis Wrong's classic criticism of socialization. Then I provide some further criticisms of the concept and locate the source of many of the problems in adult taken-for-granted assumptions. Lastly, I suggest some ways that the concept of socialization might be modified and the advantages to be gained from moving beyond the concept altogether.    Initial and Secondary Socialization    Face-to-face interaction is the fundamental setting for socialization. When individuals are together sharing time and space able to see and hear and feel the actions of each as responses to the actions of the other, a very special situation occurs for learning about others, one's self and one's impact on the world. Socialization can take place in a variety of settings but face-to-face interaction as the prototypical social experience (Berger and Luckmann, 1966), is the key one.   Sociologists identify two different kinds of socialization: initial (or primary) and secondary. Initial socialization refers to those processes that take place first-- learning one's first language, discovering one's first 'others', encountering one's first rules. Two characteristics of initial socialization are particularly crucial for the unfolding of the process: 1) The agent of socialization (the person carrying out the process) has power over the person being socialized. In the extreme this power can be that over life and death. Although this claim may sound a bit strong, in fact adults have such power over infants as the extensive evidence on child abuse makes clear. That adults do not routinely make full use of their power does not eliminate it; social limits on that power can be overcome. Exactly how children perceive the power of adults is unknown but there is no reason for assuming that they are unaware of it. 2) The person being socialized has no prior experience of that being inculcated. Compare the difference between learning one's first language and learning a second. In learning a second, one can translate into terms of the first, use the first as a basis, etc. One's first language is learned in a sense through faith--faith that what others are teaching has meaning, is worth trying and/or somehow works.   Secondary socialization differs in one very basic respect from initial socialization: it comes after initial socialization. Those undergoing secondary socialization have already been socialized and thus may be either more receptive or more defensive towards the new ideas and actions to which they are being socialized. To be born into a religion and practice it throughout one's life is very different from converting from one religion to another; in the latter process, one has both more choice (e.g. the very choice of converting or abandoning the endeavor) and more limits (e.g. the difficulty or even impossibility of coming to believe something that one had previously thought unbelievable). Secondary socialization is most successful in bringing about fundamental changes in people when the conditions under which it occurs most closely approximate those of childhood, i.e. when the one being socialized is dependent on the agents of socialization, has significantly less power than they, and has little access to outsiders. To illustrate secondary socialization when it adopts some of the fundamental features of initial socializations, sociologists commonly offer the examples of the novitiate/ seminary and of basic training in the military sphere. Typically, however, secondary socialization is less extensive and more congruent with earlier socialization.   Sociological studies of children tend to focus on initial (primary) socialization, routinely assuming that children come into the world 'empty', to be filled with the social ideas of the groups into which they are born. Even those who articulate objections to such an assumption may implicitly use it nonetheless. Sociological studies have explored both of the earlier-mentioned aspects of socialization-- becoming a group member and developing a self --by focusing on who gets socialized by whom to what with what outcomes. What is neglected in such an approach, by being assumed as nonproblematic, is what the one being socialized is doing at the time-- both with reference to the socialization process and to other projects that person has in mind. By slapping a child when that child tries to touch a hot stove, one may indeed socialize that child to keep away from that stove and even stoves in general, but 1) the child may not have planned to touch the stove but simply see how close one could get, already 'knowing' not to touch it and 2) the child's activities, whatever they are, are aborted.   Two fundamental criticisms can be addressed to the concept of socialization at this point. First, the concept of initial socialization in particular assumes that children are 'empty buckets' who readily contain whatever is poured into them. If, however, there is something already in the bucket (e.g. children's own experiences), the resulting contents are of necessity different from that which was poured in. In such cases, what has been studied as initial socialization may in fact be an outcome of secondary socialization. Second, the concept assumes the existence of an agent of socialization and an object of socialization and thus a one-way process that neglects the reciprocity that is the very heart of sociology's subject matter. (Indeed the Bergers do refer to this reciprocity, but nonetheless they focus on the child and offer no examples of children affecting adults.)     'The Oversocialized Conception of Man'    Dennis H. Wrong, in an article entitled \"The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology\" (1961), provides what has come to be viewed as a classic critique the concept of socialization. Even though his objections have been widely accepted, they have not led to sufficient modification of the concept to render his criticisms obsolete.   In his article Wrong argues that overuse and overextension of the concept of socialization has obscured that which it has claimed to study. He begins by considering one of the central questions of sociological inquiry: How is it possible that people follow social rules? One common sociological answer is: Because they are socialized to do so. Wrong finds this answer unsatisfactory, for it suggests that rule-following automatically follows socialization, that once socialized one has no choice but to follow those rules to which one was socialized, and thus that the question itself is trivial. If, as Wrong argues, the question is an important one, then any answer that trivializes it is suspect. In everyday conversation, it is not uncommon to explain why one has done something by claiming: 'That is how I learned to do it' or 'That is how I was brought up.' The insufficiency of such explanations can be demonstrated by posing the questions: Do you do everything as you learned to do it? Do you do everything that you were brought up to do? More accurate and fruitful as an empirical question is: Of those things one has learned to do/been brought up to do, which does one adopt and which does one not? This questions keeps alive the question: How is it possible that humans follow social rules? for it keeps it a question in search of an answer rather than setting it as a question with the automatic answer, socialization.   Wrong claims that the very significance of this and other fundamental questions in sociology is that they may never be answered definitively and for all times because of their complexity, but, nonetheless, their very existence serves as a basis for continued exploration and thought. New sociological studies continually make possible reconsideration of answers to these central questions, but any facile and definitive answers are suspect, for they obscure the essentially problematic nature of the questions themselves.   Although he does not criticize the concept of socialization in itself, Wrong does fault the way it has been used by sociologists. Without denying that human beings are socialized or that they internalize social norms, he argues that socialization cannot explain all human behavior, or even all rule-following behavior. He offers objections to the 'empty bucket' theory of human nature, the idea that people are born are born without any social or personal ideas and that through the socialization process this empty bucket is filled with the ideas of the social groups in which socialization takes place. The view he criticizes is called social determinism , for it claims that individual behavior is determined by the social world. In everyday talk it is exemplified in the statement made to explain one's behavior: 'Society made me do it.' Such a view in its extreme form rejects the possibility of independent human action and choice.   In everyday life it may be common to see the behavior of others as socially determined, but seldom does one apply such a notion to one's own behavior, except perhaps as a justification to others. When one seeks explanation for one's own behavior, the idea that something lying outside made one act in a particular way is more likely to be viewed as an attempt to avoid responsibility for one's acts. If indeed it is true that social determinism is found wanting when applied to one's own behavior and only plausible when applied to the behavior of others, then the theory itself should be viewed with suspicion, for it fails to explain one's own experiences, those with which one is most familiar. If any theory fails to explain one's own experiences, it may be that it explains nobody's experiences. Any theory that creates a division beween the theorist and those theorized about and that can only explain the latter contains some basic flaw.   Wrong argues that the process of internalization is not nearly as inevitable or as unproblematic as some sociologists take it to be. Indeed social ideas do become a part of the individual through internalization, but such a process is always incomplete and tentative. A focus on internalization also ignores other forces in the social world that encourage rule-following behavior. People certainly do follow rules they have internalized, but they are not compelled to do so, for one indeed may violate rules in which one believes. And people also follow rules they have not internalized, as when they engage in or forgo behavior in order to avoid punishment. In studies of social control, sociologists certainly recognize that the existence of punishment can inhibit occurrences of behavior in which people might otherwise engage, but discussions of socialization customarily minimize this aspect of rule-following.   While recognizing the two different aspects of socialization --creation of group members and creation of the self--Wrong emphasizes that these two processes are not identical and in any given instance may be  either antithetical or sympathetic. Sociologists have focused on the sympathetic dimension of this process --what's good for the group is good for the individual; Freud (see especially Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930) focused on the antithetical dimension, the sacrifices the group requires of the self. Wrong urges a more balanced view which, while more ambiguous and complex, is more reflective of the social worlds in which we live and act.     Further Criticisms    Against the background of the concepts of initial and secondary socialization and Wrong's criticisms, we can now consider specific objections that can be made to the concept of socialization. The Bergers' presentation in the foregoing chapter is by no means the naive approach to the topic Wrong faults; indeed it displays many insights. Nonetheless, their rendition of the socialization process includes a number of commonly made claims that can be viewed as problematic. The objections that can be made to their presentation are even more applicable to less clear and sophisticated formulations.   The Bergers [In this discussion, particular attention is focused on those passages in the Bergers's article that were printed in bold type.] retain the notions of children as 'empty buckers' and the agents of socialization as routinely successful in their endeavors. They Claim that children as a matter of course  accept the patterns that surround them as the only possible patterns, for those patterns 'are experienced in a very absolute way, (Berger and Berger, p. 6). Although examples can be offered in abundance to show that children do experience their own ways in absolute terms, as the only ways -- the author was reprimanded by a 3-year-old for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 'the wrong way', putting the peanut butter on one slice of bread and the jelly on another rather than putting the jelly on the peanut butter-- the issue to be raised here is not: Can children experience the world in absolute terms? for indeed they can, but: Must they do so? Over-dependence on the notion of socialization impedes the very asking of such a question.   Evidence also exists, however, that children do experience at least some aspects of their world in their own terms and in contrast to others' views, providing children with at least the possibility of relativism. Food preferences may serve as one example, for the youngest of children may display likes and dislikes that defy adult efforts at modification and that those children maintain into adulthood, when they have more power to carry through on their own preferences. One might argue that food preferences can be biologically based; other examples, however, can be offered. Children who 'always wanted a pet' may resist all adult efforts to eradicate the idea and may find in adulthood that they both enjoy having a pet and feel they would have done so in childhood. Children's conceptions of the aesthetic and practical qualities of insects can be quite at odds with the views of those with whom they associate; where then do their ideas come from? (To suggest that ideas come from peers simply pushes the problem back a step. Where did peers get their ideas?) In a more general sense, children may perceive a diffuse sense of a gap or a 'wrong' in their lives. That they do not have the power to implement their alternative views and that adults can deny that there is any gap or 'wrong' does not mean that children accept the world around them in absolute terms; it only means that they appear to do so.   The assumption that agents of socialization are routinely successful in their endeavors is captured in the Bergers' statement that ithe probable outcome of any conflict [between child and adult] is a victory on the part of the adults' (Berger and Berger, p. 6). Rather than making assumptions about the results of any such conflicts, it would be more scientific to take such outcomes as problematic. What constitutes victory, what defeat? For whom is a midnight feeding a victory? When the outcome of adult/child conflicts is viewed as problematic, it becomes possible to consider, for instance, the power resources that children have available to them, resources that may make it possible for them to achieve victories. Children's resources may differ from those available to adults but they are not thereby either negligible or ineffective. Adult power over children ultimately rests on the fact that they have control over children's life and death; conversely, children have the power to die--power that failure-to-thrive children might be said to display. The results of attempts to bottle-feed a child accustomed to the breast are not so certain as the Bergers' claim would suggest.   What are the criteria for judging the success of socialization? One such criterion might be parental claims of their own success: 'My children turned out just the way I wanted them to.' Such claims are so rare that they can hardly be put forward as self-evident proof that socialization is routinely successful. In the absence of criteria for judging the success of socialization, any such claims appear more a matter of faith than evidence. Empirical study of the success and failure of various socialization endeavors would seem necessary before any scientific claims could be made.   Although it might seem that knowledge drawn from the natural sciences could inform the notion of socialization, rendering it more scientific, in fact the natural sciences themselves are not immune to the social context in which they develop. Medical statements, to all appearances scientific, are made about children's 'needs'. Such apparently absolute claims, however, routinely embody, albeit implicitly, conditional claims: these needs must be fulfilled if one is to emerge a human being of the kind recognizable in the biologist's society and if one is to avoid certain outcomes judged as negative in that society. Children need three balanced meals a day only if they are to have access to the health advantages deemed important in a given society. But not all societies structure food consumption around three meals--some have fewer, some more and what is viewed as an avoidable nutritional or medical problem in one society can be viewed, in another society, as unavoidable or even 'normal'. In the not too distant past in the US, it was normal for a woman to lose at least some of the children she bore to childhood diseases--so normal that the answer to the question 'How many children do you have?' could routinely be 'Seven living'.   Statements drawn from the natural sciences about children's abilities and inabilities may well serve as blinders, preventing the recognition of what children can do, especially those children who do that which science tends to assume they cannot. Child prodigies--6-year-old mathematicians and virtuoso violinists --are taken to be exceptional. Would there be more child prodigies if they were seen as normal? There are societies where 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds live almost entirely without adult supervision, where 13-year-old females routinely bear and rear children, and where young children themselves have the care and responsibility of those younger. Whether or not such practices are desirable is a moral issue that has no relevance for whether or not the practices are possible, as indeed they are. That people in the US do not socialize children to be mothers at age 13 obviously does not mean that they cannot be mothers. To see negative implications of such practices and to choose to avoid them does not drive them out of existence as possibilities.   Many of the criticisms that can be directed to the concept of socialization have in common their source in sociologists' failures to explore their taken-for-granted assumptions about their own social worlds and in particular about children in those social worlds. In Chapter 5 I describe some of the assumptions that adults make about children that, when made by sociologists, can distort the data they collect. In the next section I detail three notable and consequential assumptions that are embedded in socialization as it is used conceptually by sociologists.     Taken-for-granted Assumptions    The sociological literature on socialization embodies two assumptions, seldom investigated or-even recognized, that are embodied in the following two renditions of the same sentence:   Parents routinely socialize their children.  Parents routinely socialize their children.   With respect to the first formulation, indeed it does happen throughout the world that the biological parents of children rear those children. And it also happens that children are reared primarily by others: step-parents, adoptive parents, foster parents, one parent (and the usage of the term parent in all these terms should not delude us into thinking those to whom the term is applied are interchangeable and the same), siblings, other relatives, friends, affiliates of social service and charitable agencies, nannies and nursemaids, day care workers, and so on. The assumption in the sociological literature, however, is that parents or those acting like parents (whatever that might entail) are the primary agents of socialization. (See both Robertson, 1989 and Vander Zanden, 1990 for discussions of the family as the major agent of initial socialization.) Support for the assumption that sociologists have made about the primacy of parents, however, is provided far more by the ideological status of the family in the US and in the West in general than by the data. A fresh look at arrangements throughout the world and a genuine asking of the question 'Who socializes children?' would seem to be in order.   The claim that parents routinely socialize their children can be read in a second way, emphasizing not  parents but the term socialize. Such a reading brings to light a second unexamined assumption, namely that parents routinely socialize their children. The first issue to raise here is: How is 'socializing children' to be distinguished from the other activities that adults direct towards children? Could one, for example, reasonably ask on a questionnaire: How much time per day do you spend socializing your children? If socialization is viewed as an intentional activity engaged in by an agent of socialization, perhaps the questionnaire question could be answered. If, on the other hand, socialization is viewed as the outcome of myriad activities, intentional and unintentional, successful and unsuccessful, measured only by manifestations in adult behavior, and if socialization is so inextricably linked to child-rearing in general, how can it be studied sociologically as an independent phenomenon?   Although it is certainly the case in the US, for instance, that the task of socializing children is ideologically and legally assigned to the parents of those children, it does not follow that those parents always and necessarily do socialize their children. Indeed such an inference is contradicted by ample evidence of parents who neglect their children (in the sense of ignoring them), whose acts towards children are directed largely to controlling them (in the sense of preventing them from being a disruption to adult activities), or whose notion of socializing children departs radically from the social norms (as can been seen in the regularly appearing stories in sensational newspapers of children caged, chained, etc. 'for their own good'). That children learn from their experiences is indisputable, but the application of the term socialization to the above examples appears to be a distortion of either the concept or the experiences or both. Can children who have the kinds of experiences described in this paragraph be said to be socialized? If so, by whom? And to what?   In descriptions of socialization, adults are likely to appear as deity-like figures, solely concerned with the welfare of their charges and subsuming their own needs to those of children. Adults appear as kindly, loving, both motivated to socialize children to the broader society and equal to that task. Such a glowing picture has far more in common with an ideological than a scientific formulation. Interestingly enough, when examples are provided of children who have been isolated from human contact, caged, chained, etc., attention centers on what can be learned about the importance of sociahzation for children. Such examples can also be, though seldom are, read as challenges to the view that all adults actively and competently socialize their children.   Yet a third taken-for-granted assumption underlying socialization is that there is only one available social group --commonly termed 'society'-- to which one can be socialized. While the sociological literature on deviance does address the issue of groups competing to socialize individuals, e.g. the family and the gang, such competition is not routinely addressed in theoretical presentations of the concept of socialization. When it is addressed, it tends to be as an explanation of some particular discrepancy-- a 'good' child from a 'bad' home, a 'bad' child from a 'good' home--rather than as a general feature of the socialization process. An assumption of social homogeneity obscures consideration of the groups that might compete for individuals, but once such competition is recognized as a possibility, it can be sought in such situations as disagreements in child-rearing between spouses, between parents and teachers (see, for example, Goode with Waksler, 1990), between church and state, and between and among any competing groups which in some sense have access to the same individual.   Taken-for-granted assumptions embodied in the idea that parents socialize children obscure from view the many situations where socialization is done by others and where parents' activities directed towards children are either occasionally or primarily oriented to goals other than socialization. The assumption that there is only one group society -- to which one is socialized obscures from view alternative groups, groups that may well vie with one another for members/followers.     Socialization and Beyond    In the foregoing I have presented some fundamental criticisms of the notion of socialization. Pervading the presentation is the idea that socialization as it is generally employed by sociologists obscures from view significant aspects of children's and adults' social behavior. Refinement of the concept by setting as problematic aspects heretofore taken for granted as true could make some of these aspects available for study. In reconceptualizing socialization I would recommend directing particular attention to the following kinds of questions:   1. Is socialization the name for an identifiable and documentable process or is it the name for an assumption made to organize a wide range of activities;   2. In what respects are the socialization of children and adults (both initial and secondary) different processes and in what respects are they similar?   3. When socialization is taking place, what is the one being socialized doing at the time --both with reference to the socialization process and to other projects that person has in mind?   4. Are children empty buckets who readily contain what is poured into them? If not, and I suspect that there is general sociological agreement that they are not, what do they contain and what are the implications of these contents for socialization?   5. Is socialization best understood as a one-way process between an agent of socialization and an object of socialization or is it better conceived of as a reciprocal relationship with each influencing the other?   6. Are agents of socialization routinely successful in their endeavors? What are the criteria for judging the success of socialization? Setting as problematic the outcomes of socialization would seem to be a more scientific approach than making assumptions about those outcomes.   7. Who routinely socializes children? How, specifically, do they go about it. Taking these to be empirical questions rather than rhetorical ones would seem fruitful.   8. Of the many activities that adults and children participate in together, which ones can be identified as socialization? Which ones cannot?   9 Is there only one group (society) to which children are socialized or are there alternative groups, groups which may well vie with one another for members/followers? If there is competition and conflict, documentation would seem to be In order.   10. How can socialization best be studied to preserve the integrity of the fundamental sociological questions (e.g. those identified by Wrong) ?   Even if the concept of socialization were modified to take into account the questions posed above, it could never encompass the entirety of children's experiences, for children do more than 'get socialized'. To expect any single concept to have such range and such explanatory power is in all likelihood unreasonable. Just as the concept of family does not explain all of the experiences of family members, and just as the concept of deviance omits the non-deviant aspects of those labeled deviant, the concept of socialization omits aspects of children's behavior (and of adults' behavior as well). In particular it leaves out both what children are doing when others are socializing them, and when others are not. It neglects the worlds that children design by themselves for themselves. It fails to examine children's ideas and activities as their ways of being in the world. Furthermore, these omissions are not shortcomings of the concept itself and cannot be rectified by modifying the concept; they are a necessary consequence of the fact that socialization is only one way of looking at children.   Thus I recommend moving beyond socialization to consider other ways of looking at children's lives. No systematic theoretical guidelines are readily available in the sociological literature, but some guidelines are explicit in the work of a number of sociologists. Two major approachers can be inferred from that work: 1) to consider studies conducted from an adult perspective not as findings about children but as data on how adults can view children and thus on the adult worlds in which children live (a perspective I have labeled 'children in an adult world') and 2) to conduct studies from children's perspectives (a perspective I refer to as 'children in a child's world'). The selections in Parts II and III of this book provide examples of both of these perspectives and thus of what can be learned about children by going beyond socialization.     Endnote    In this chapter I have raised criticisms about the ways that sociologists have studied children and indicated alternative approaches. Before considering data from those alternative perspectives, however, it will be helpful to learn what other sociological critics have to recommend. In Chapter 3, Mackay, drawing on data gathered in a classroom setting, shows the complexity and subtlety of the knowledge children need to possess simply to carry out classroom tasks, features that are obscured when one limits oneself to an adult perspective.       This article is included to make us think about our taken-for-granted categories, as we try to look more closely at children and students from their perspectives, not from our own."}]},

New York: Falmer Press, 1991 [&#169; Selection and editorial material copyright F.S. Waksler, 1991]    Chapter 2    Beyond Socialization   Frances Chaput Waksler         Introduction    The purpose of this chapter is to set forth some major criticisms that can be made of the concept of socialization as it is formulated and used by sociologists. To identify problems is not necessarily to provide resolutions, but clearly it is a fundamental step in that process.   The Bergers' description of socialization was chosen for inclusion as Chapter 1 and for criticism in this chapter because theirs is a particularly sophisticated introductory treatment. While they avoid the pitfalls inherent in overly simplified presentations, the very clarity of their work sets in relief problematic aspects of the concept of socialization. Such problems characterize virtually all introductory treatments (see for example, Robertson, 1989 and Vander Zanden 1990). In this chapter, the specific criticisms to be put forth center around two general features of socialization: the concept itself and its range.     The Concept Itself    Is socialization the name for an identifiable and documentable process whose existence is subject to proof or refutation, or is it rather the name for an assumption made to organize a wide range of activities? Either can prove useful to understanding but they are in no sense interchangeable. What follows is not dependent upon either answer to the question posed, though the ideas presented lead towards the conclusion that the concept of socialization names an assumption rather than an empirically verifiable process. (In Chapter 3, Mackay argues that the concept as it is currently constituted is not a sociological concept at all but merely an everyday adult view of children.)     The Range of the Concept    In the Sociological literature, studies of socialization have focused extensively on children and the study of children has been conducted primarily in terms of socialization. As a consequence socialization of children and of adults have been conceived of as different rather than similar processes as evidenced for example in the distinction between initial and secondary socialization. Children's activities unrelated to socialization have been until quite recently minimally investigated by sociologists. The range of the concept of socialization can thus be said to be both too narrow (when it focuses only on children) and too broad (when it serves as the major way to understand children) .   In what follows I first discuss an important distinction sociologists make between initial and secondary socialization, a topic touched upon in the previous chapter. This distinction assumes the existence of clear differences between adults and children and obscures similarities. Next I consider Dennis Wrong's classic criticism of socialization. Then I provide some further criticisms of the concept and locate the source of many of the problems in adult taken-for-granted assumptions. Lastly, I suggest some ways that the concept of socialization might be modified and the advantages to be gained from moving beyond the concept altogether.    Initial and Secondary Socialization    Face-to-face interaction is the fundamental setting for socialization. When individuals are together sharing time and space able to see and hear and feel the actions of each as responses to the actions of the other, a very special situation occurs for learning about others, one's self and one's impact on the world. Socialization can take place in a variety of settings but face-to-face interaction as the prototypical social experience (Berger and Luckmann, 1966), is the key one.   Sociologists identify two different kinds of socialization: initial (or primary) and secondary. Initial socialization refers to those processes that take place first-- learning one's first language, discovering one's first 'others', encountering one's first rules. Two characteristics of initial socialization are particularly crucial for the unfolding of the process: 1) The agent of socialization (the person carrying out the process) has power over the person being socialized. In the extreme this power can be that over life and death. Although this claim may sound a bit strong, in fact adults have such power over infants as the extensive evidence on child abuse makes clear. That adults do not routinely make full use of their power does not eliminate it; social limits on that power can be overcome. Exactly how children perceive the power of adults is unknown but there is no reason for assuming that they are unaware of it. 2) The person being socialized has no prior experience of that being inculcated. Compare the difference between learning one's first language and learning a second. In learning a second, one can translate into terms of the first, use the first as a basis, etc. One's first language is learned in a sense through faith--faith that what others are teaching has meaning, is worth trying and/or somehow works.   Secondary socialization differs in one very basic respect from initial socialization: it comes after initial socialization. Those undergoing secondary socialization have already been socialized and thus may be either more receptive or more defensive towards the new ideas and actions to which they are being socialized. To be born into a religion and practice it throughout one's life is very different from converting from one religion to another; in the latter process, one has both more choice (e.g. the very choice of converting or abandoning the endeavor) and more limits (e.g. the difficulty or even impossibility of coming to believe something that one had previously thought unbelievable). Secondary socialization is most successful in bringing about fundamental changes in people when the conditions under which it occurs most closely approximate those of childhood, i.e. when the one being socialized is dependent on the agents of socialization, has significantly less power than they, and has little access to outsiders. To illustrate secondary socialization when it adopts some of the fundamental features of initial socializations, sociologists commonly offer the examples of the novitiate/ seminary and of basic training in the military sphere. Typically, however, secondary socialization is less extensive and more congruent with earlier socialization.   Sociological studies of children tend to focus on initial (primary) socialization, routinely assuming that children come into the world 'empty', to be filled with the social ideas of the groups into which they are born. Even those who articulate objections to such an assumption may implicitly use it nonetheless. Sociological studies have explored both of the earlier-mentioned aspects of socialization-- becoming a group member and developing a self --by focusing on who gets socialized by whom to what with what outcomes. What is neglected in such an approach, by being assumed as nonproblematic, is what the one being socialized is doing at the time-- both with reference to the socialization process and to other projects that person has in mind. By slapping a child when that child tries to touch a hot stove, one may indeed socialize that child to keep away from that stove and even stoves in general, but 1) the child may not have planned to touch the stove but simply see how close one could get, already 'knowing' not to touch it and 2) the child's activities, whatever they are, are aborted.   Two fundamental criticisms can be addressed to the concept of socialization at this point. First, the concept of initial socialization in particular assumes that children are 'empty buckets' who readily contain whatever is poured into them. If, however, there is something already in the bucket (e.g. children's own experiences), the resulting contents are of necessity different from that which was poured in. In such cases, what has been studied as initial socialization may in fact be an outcome of secondary socialization. Second, the concept assumes the existence of an agent of socialization and an object of socialization and thus a one-way process that neglects the reciprocity that is the very heart of sociology's subject matter. (Indeed the Bergers do refer to this reciprocity, but nonetheless they focus on the child and offer no examples of children affecting adults.)     'The Oversocialized Conception of Man'    Dennis H. Wrong, in an article entitled \"The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology\" (1961), provides what has come to be viewed as a classic critique the concept of socialization. Even though his objections have been widely accepted, they have not led to sufficient modification of the concept to render his criticisms obsolete.   In his article Wrong argues that overuse and overextension of the concept of socialization has obscured that which it has claimed to study. He begins by considering one of the central questions of sociological inquiry: How is it possible that people follow social rules? One common sociological answer is: Because they are socialized to do so. Wrong finds this answer unsatisfactory, for it suggests that rule-following automatically follows socialization, that once socialized one has no choice but to follow those rules to which one was socialized, and thus that the question itself is trivial. If, as Wrong argues, the question is an important one, then any answer that trivializes it is suspect. In everyday conversation, it is not uncommon to explain why one has done something by claiming: 'That is how I learned to do it' or 'That is how I was brought up.' The insufficiency of such explanations can be demonstrated by posing the questions: Do you do everything as you learned to do it? Do you do everything that you were brought up to do? More accurate and fruitful as an empirical question is: Of those things one has learned to do/been brought up to do, which does one adopt and which does one not? This questions keeps alive the question: How is it possible that humans follow social rules? for it keeps it a question in search of an answer rather than setting it as a question with the automatic answer, socialization.   Wrong claims that the very significance of this and other fundamental questions in sociology is that they may never be answered definitively and for all times because of their complexity, but, nonetheless, their very existence serves as a basis for continued exploration and thought. New sociological studies continually make possible reconsideration of answers to these central questions, but any facile and definitive answers are suspect, for they obscure the essentially problematic nature of the questions themselves.   Although he does not criticize the concept of socialization in itself, Wrong does fault the way it has been used by sociologists. Without denying that human beings are socialized or that they internalize social norms, he argues that socialization cannot explain all human behavior, or even all rule-following behavior. He offers objections to the 'empty bucket' theory of human nature, the idea that people are born are born without any social or personal ideas and that through the socialization process this empty bucket is filled with the ideas of the social groups in which socialization takes place. The view he criticizes is called social determinism , for it claims that individual behavior is determined by the social world. In everyday talk it is exemplified in the statement made to explain one's behavior: 'Society made me do it.' Such a view in its extreme form rejects the possibility of independent human action and choice.   In everyday life it may be common to see the behavior of others as socially determined, but seldom does one apply such a notion to one's own behavior, except perhaps as a justification to others. When one seeks explanation for one's own behavior, the idea that something lying outside made one act in a particular way is more likely to be viewed as an attempt to avoid responsibility for one's acts. If indeed it is true that social determinism is found wanting when applied to one's own behavior and only plausible when applied to the behavior of others, then the theory itself should be viewed with suspicion, for it fails to explain one's own experiences, those with which one is most familiar. If any theory fails to explain one's own experiences, it may be that it explains nobody's experiences. Any theory that creates a division beween the theorist and those theorized about and that can only explain the latter contains some basic flaw.   Wrong argues that the process of internalization is not nearly as inevitable or as unproblematic as some sociologists take it to be. Indeed social ideas do become a part of the individual through internalization, but such a process is always incomplete and tentative. A focus on internalization also ignores other forces in the social world that encourage rule-following behavior. People certainly do follow rules they have internalized, but they are not compelled to do so, for one indeed may violate rules in which one believes. And people also follow rules they have not internalized, as when they engage in or forgo behavior in order to avoid punishment. In studies of social control, sociologists certainly recognize that the existence of punishment can inhibit occurrences of behavior in which people might otherwise engage, but discussions of socialization customarily minimize this aspect of rule-following.   While recognizing the two different aspects of socialization --creation of group members and creation of the self--Wrong emphasizes that these two processes are not identical and in any given instance may be  either antithetical or sympathetic. Sociologists have focused on the sympathetic dimension of this process --what's good for the group is good for the individual; Freud (see especially Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930) focused on the antithetical dimension, the sacrifices the group requires of the self. Wrong urges a more balanced view which, while more ambiguous and complex, is more reflective of the social worlds in which we live and act.     Further Criticisms    Against the background of the concepts of initial and secondary socialization and Wrong's criticisms, we can now consider specific objections that can be made to the concept of socialization. The Bergers' presentation in the foregoing chapter is by no means the naive approach to the topic Wrong faults; indeed it displays many insights. Nonetheless, their rendition of the socialization process includes a number of commonly made claims that can be viewed as problematic. The objections that can be made to their presentation are even more applicable to less clear and sophisticated formulations.   The Bergers [In this discussion, particular attention is focused on those passages in the Bergers's article that were printed in bold type.] retain the notions of children as 'empty buckers' and the agents of socialization as routinely successful in their endeavors. They Claim that children as a matter of course  accept the patterns that surround them as the only possible patterns, for those patterns 'are experienced in a very absolute way, (Berger and Berger, p. 6). Although examples can be offered in abundance to show that children do experience their own ways in absolute terms, as the only ways -- the author was reprimanded by a 3-year-old for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 'the wrong way', putting the peanut butter on one slice of bread and the jelly on another rather than putting the jelly on the peanut butter-- the issue to be raised here is not: Can children experience the world in absolute terms? for indeed they can, but: Must they do so? Over-dependence on the notion of socialization impedes the very asking of such a question.   Evidence also exists, however, that children do experience at least some aspects of their world in their own terms and in contrast to others' views, providing children with at least the possibility of relativism. Food preferences may serve as one example, for the youngest of children may display likes and dislikes that defy adult efforts at modification and that those children maintain into adulthood, when they have more power to carry through on their own preferences. One might argue that food preferences can be biologically based; other examples, however, can be offered. Children who 'always wanted a pet' may resist all adult efforts to eradicate the idea and may find in adulthood that they both enjoy having a pet and feel they would have done so in childhood. Children's conceptions of the aesthetic and practical qualities of insects can be quite at odds with the views of those with whom they associate; where then do their ideas come from? (To suggest that ideas come from peers simply pushes the problem back a step. Where did peers get their ideas?) In a more general sense, children may perceive a diffuse sense of a gap or a 'wrong' in their lives. That they do not have the power to implement their alternative views and that adults can deny that there is any gap or 'wrong' does not mean that children accept the world around them in absolute terms; it only means that they appear to do so.   The assumption that agents of socialization are routinely successful in their endeavors is captured in the Bergers' statement that ithe probable outcome of any conflict [between child and adult] is a victory on the part of the adults' (Berger and Berger, p. 6). Rather than making assumptions about the results of any such conflicts, it would be more scientific to take such outcomes as problematic. What constitutes victory, what defeat? For whom is a midnight feeding a victory? When the outcome of adult/child conflicts is viewed as problematic, it becomes possible to consider, for instance, the power resources that children have available to them, resources that may make it possible for them to achieve victories. Children's resources may differ from those available to adults but they are not thereby either negligible or ineffective. Adult power over children ultimately rests on the fact that they have control over children's life and death; conversely, children have the power to die--power that failure-to-thrive children might be said to display. The results of attempts to bottle-feed a child accustomed to the breast are not so certain as the Bergers' claim would suggest.   What are the criteria for judging the success of socialization? One such criterion might be parental claims of their own success: 'My children turned out just the way I wanted them to.' Such claims are so rare that they can hardly be put forward as self-evident proof that socialization is routinely successful. In the absence of criteria for judging the success of socialization, any such claims appear more a matter of faith than evidence. Empirical study of the success and failure of various socialization endeavors would seem necessary before any scientific claims could be made.   Although it might seem that knowledge drawn from the natural sciences could inform the notion of socialization, rendering it more scientific, in fact the natural sciences themselves are not immune to the social context in which they develop. Medical statements, to all appearances scientific, are made about children's 'needs'. Such apparently absolute claims, however, routinely embody, albeit implicitly, conditional claims: these needs must be fulfilled if one is to emerge a human being of the kind recognizable in the biologist's society and if one is to avoid certain outcomes judged as negative in that society. Children need three balanced meals a day only if they are to have access to the health advantages deemed important in a given society. But not all societies structure food consumption around three meals--some have fewer, some more and what is viewed as an avoidable nutritional or medical problem in one society can be viewed, in another society, as unavoidable or even 'normal'. In the not too distant past in the US, it was normal for a woman to lose at least some of the children she bore to childhood diseases--so normal that the answer to the question 'How many children do you have?' could routinely be 'Seven living'.   Statements drawn from the natural sciences about children's abilities and inabilities may well serve as blinders, preventing the recognition of what children can do, especially those children who do that which science tends to assume they cannot. Child prodigies--6-year-old mathematicians and virtuoso violinists --are taken to be exceptional. Would there be more child prodigies if they were seen as normal? There are societies where 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds live almost entirely without adult supervision, where 13-year-old females routinely bear and rear children, and where young children themselves have the care and responsibility of those younger. Whether or not such practices are desirable is a moral issue that has no relevance for whether or not the practices are possible, as indeed they are. That people in the US do not socialize children to be mothers at age 13 obviously does not mean that they cannot be mothers. To see negative implications of such practices and to choose to avoid them does not drive them out of existence as possibilities.   Many of the criticisms that can be directed to the concept of socialization have in common their source in sociologists' failures to explore their taken-for-granted assumptions about their own social worlds and in particular about children in those social worlds. In Chapter 5 I describe some of the assumptions that adults make about children that, when made by sociologists, can distort the data they collect. In the next section I detail three notable and consequential assumptions that are embedded in socialization as it is used conceptually by sociologists.     Taken-for-granted Assumptions    The sociological literature on socialization embodies two assumptions, seldom investigated or-even recognized, that are embodied in the following two renditions of the same sentence:   Parents routinely socialize their children.  Parents routinely socialize their children.   With respect to the first formulation, indeed it does happen throughout the world that the biological parents of children rear those children. And it also happens that children are reared primarily by others: step-parents, adoptive parents, foster parents, one parent (and the usage of the term parent in all these terms should not delude us into thinking those to whom the term is applied are interchangeable and the same), siblings, other relatives, friends, affiliates of social service and charitable agencies, nannies and nursemaids, day care workers, and so on. The assumption in the sociological literature, however, is that parents or those acting like parents (whatever that might entail) are the primary agents of socialization. (See both Robertson, 1989 and Vander Zanden, 1990 for discussions of the family as the major agent of initial socialization.) Support for the assumption that sociologists have made about the primacy of parents, however, is provided far more by the ideological status of the family in the US and in the West in general than by the data. A fresh look at arrangements throughout the world and a genuine asking of the question 'Who socializes children?' would seem to be in order.   The claim that parents routinely socialize their children can be read in a second way, emphasizing not  parents but the term socialize. Such a reading brings to light a second unexamined assumption, namely that parents routinely socialize their children. The first issue to raise here is: How is 'socializing children' to be distinguished from the other activities that adults direct towards children? Could one, for example, reasonably ask on a questionnaire: How much time per day do you spend socializing your children? If socialization is viewed as an intentional activity engaged in by an agent of socialization, perhaps the questionnaire question could be answered. If, on the other hand, socialization is viewed as the outcome of myriad activities, intentional and unintentional, successful and unsuccessful, measured only by manifestations in adult behavior, and if socialization is so inextricably linked to child-rearing in general, how can it be studied sociologically as an independent phenomenon?   Although it is certainly the case in the US, for instance, that the task of socializing children is ideologically and legally assigned to the parents of those children, it does not follow that those parents always and necessarily do socialize their children. Indeed such an inference is contradicted by ample evidence of parents who neglect their children (in the sense of ignoring them), whose acts towards children are directed largely to controlling them (in the sense of preventing them from being a disruption to adult activities), or whose notion of socializing children departs radically from the social norms (as can been seen in the regularly appearing stories in sensational newspapers of children caged, chained, etc. 'for their own good'). That children learn from their experiences is indisputable, but the application of the term socialization to the above examples appears to be a distortion of either the concept or the experiences or both. Can children who have the kinds of experiences described in this paragraph be said to be socialized? If so, by whom? And to what?   In descriptions of socialization, adults are likely to appear as deity-like figures, solely concerned with the welfare of their charges and subsuming their own needs to those of children. Adults appear as kindly, loving, both motivated to socialize children to the broader society and equal to that task. Such a glowing picture has far more in common with an ideological than a scientific formulation. Interestingly enough, when examples are provided of children who have been isolated from human contact, caged, chained, etc., attention centers on what can be learned about the importance of sociahzation for children. Such examples can also be, though seldom are, read as challenges to the view that all adults actively and competently socialize their children.   Yet a third taken-for-granted assumption underlying socialization is that there is only one available social group --commonly termed 'society'-- to which one can be socialized. While the sociological literature on deviance does address the issue of groups competing to socialize individuals, e.g. the family and the gang, such competition is not routinely addressed in theoretical presentations of the concept of socialization. When it is addressed, it tends to be as an explanation of some particular discrepancy-- a 'good' child from a 'bad' home, a 'bad' child from a 'good' home--rather than as a general feature of the socialization process. An assumption of social homogeneity obscures consideration of the groups that might compete for individuals, but once such competition is recognized as a possibility, it can be sought in such situations as disagreements in child-rearing between spouses, between parents and teachers (see, for example, Goode with Waksler, 1990), between church and state, and between and among any competing groups which in some sense have access to the same individual.   Taken-for-granted assumptions embodied in the idea that parents socialize children obscure from view the many situations where socialization is done by others and where parents' activities directed towards children are either occasionally or primarily oriented to goals other than socialization. The assumption that there is only one group society -- to which one is socialized obscures from view alternative groups, groups that may well vie with one another for members/followers.     Socialization and Beyond    In the foregoing I have presented some fundamental criticisms of the notion of socialization. Pervading the presentation is the idea that socialization as it is generally employed by sociologists obscures from view significant aspects of children's and adults' social behavior. Refinement of the concept by setting as problematic aspects heretofore taken for granted as true could make some of these aspects available for study. In reconceptualizing socialization I would recommend directing particular attention to the following kinds of questions:   1. Is socialization the name for an identifiable and documentable process or is it the name for an assumption made to organize a wide range of activities;   2. In what respects are the socialization of children and adults (both initial and secondary) different processes and in what respects are they similar?   3. When socialization is taking place, what is the one being socialized doing at the time --both with reference to the socialization process and to other projects that person has in mind?   4. Are children empty buckets who readily contain what is poured into them? If not, and I suspect that there is general sociological agreement that they are not, what do they contain and what are the implications of these contents for socialization?   5. Is socialization best understood as a one-way process between an agent of socialization and an object of socialization or is it better conceived of as a reciprocal relationship with each influencing the other?   6. Are agents of socialization routinely successful in their endeavors? What are the criteria for judging the success of socialization? Setting as problematic the outcomes of socialization would seem to be a more scientific approach than making assumptions about those outcomes.   7. Who routinely socializes children? How, specifically, do they go about it. Taking these to be empirical questions rather than rhetorical ones would seem fruitful.   8. Of the many activities that adults and children participate in together, which ones can be identified as socialization? Which ones cannot?   9 Is there only one group (society) to which children are socialized or are there alternative groups, groups which may well vie with one another for members/followers? If there is competition and conflict, documentation would seem to be In order.   10. How can socialization best be studied to preserve the integrity of the fundamental sociological questions (e.g. those identified by Wrong) ?   Even if the concept of socialization were modified to take into account the questions posed above, it could never encompass the entirety of children's experiences, for children do more than 'get socialized'. To expect any single concept to have such range and such explanatory power is in all likelihood unreasonable. Just as the concept of family does not explain all of the experiences of family members, and just as the concept of deviance omits the non-deviant aspects of those labeled deviant, the concept of socialization omits aspects of children's behavior (and of adults' behavior as well). In particular it leaves out both what children are doing when others are socializing them, and when others are not. It neglects the worlds that children design by themselves for themselves. It fails to examine children's ideas and activities as their ways of being in the world. Furthermore, these omissions are not shortcomings of the concept itself and cannot be rectified by modifying the concept; they are a necessary consequence of the fact that socialization is only one way of looking at children.   Thus I recommend moving beyond socialization to consider other ways of looking at children's lives. No systematic theoretical guidelines are readily available in the sociological literature, but some guidelines are explicit in the work of a number of sociologists. Two major approachers can be inferred from that work: 1) to consider studies conducted from an adult perspective not as findings about children but as data on how adults can view children and thus on the adult worlds in which children live (a perspective I have labeled 'children in an adult world') and 2) to conduct studies from children's perspectives (a perspective I refer to as 'children in a child's world'). The selections in Parts II and III of this book provide examples of both of these perspectives and thus of what can be learned about children by going beyond socialization.     Endnote    In this chapter I have raised criticisms about the ways that sociologists have studied children and indicated alternative approaches. Before considering data from those alternative perspectives, however, it will be helpful to learn what other sociological critics have to recommend. In Chapter 3, Mackay, drawing on data gathered in a classroom setting, shows the complexity and subtlety of the knowledge children need to possess simply to carry out classroom tasks, features that are obscured when one limits oneself to an adult perspective.

Chapter 5, pp. 98-107 in Understanding Society: An Introduction to Sociology . 3rd ed. New York, NY: Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, Inc.    Socialization    A girl named Genie was found in the United States in 1970. Genie's father had kept her locked in a room from the age of 20 months until age 13. Genie was harnessed naked to an infant's potty seat and left alone for hours and days through the years. When she was remembered at night, she was put to bed in a homemade straitjacket. There were no radios or televisions in the house, people spoke in hushed tones, and the only language Genie heard was an occasional obscenity from her father. He hated noise, and if Genie made any sound her father would growl at her like a dog or beat her with a stick. As a result of her confinement, Genie could not walk and her eyes could not focus beyond the boundaries of her room. She was malnourished, incontinent, and salivated constantly [Curtiss, 1977].     Despite all this, when the psychologist Susan Curtiss first met her, Genie was alert, curious, and intensely eager for human contact. When frightened or frustrated she would erupt into silent frenzies of rage--flailing about, scratching, spitting, throwing objects, but never uttering a sound. Aside from not speaking, her lack of socialization was apparent in her behavior: She would urinate in unacceptable places, go up to someone in a store and take whatever she liked of theirs, and peer intently into the faces of strangers at close range. Although Curtiss worked with her for several years, Genie never developed language abilities beyond those of a 4-year-old, and she ended up being placed in an institution.    The story of Genie shows the importance of socialization in human society. Socialization refers to preparing newcomers to become members of an existing group and to think, feel, and act in ways the group considers appropriate. Viewed from the group's point of view, it is a process of member replacement. Such widely diverse situations as child rearing, teaching someone a new game, orienting a new member of an organization, preparing someone who has been in sales work to become a manager, or acquainting an immigrant with the life and culture of a new society are all instances of socialization.    Socialization is a central process in social life. Its importance has been noted by sociologists for a long time, but their image of it has shifted over the last hundred years.\u00a0 In the early years of American sociology, socialization was equated with civilization. The issue was one of taming fierce individualists so they would willingly cooperate with others on common endeavors. An unruly human nature was assumed to exist prior to an individual's encounter with society. This nature had to be shaped to conform to socially acceptable ways of behaving.    As time went on, however, socialization came to be seen more and more as the end result-- that is, as internalization. Internalization means taking social norms, roles, and values into one's own mind. Society was seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learned to think and behave. This view is evident in the work of functionalist Talcott Parsons, who gave no hint that the result of socialization might be uncertain or might vary from person to person. If people failed to play their expected roles or behaved strangely, functionalists explained this in terms of incomplete or inadequate socialization. Such people were said to be &quot;unsocialized&quot;--they had not yet learned what was expected of them. The trouble is, they might very well know what was expected but simply be rejecting it. Someone who runs a red light, for example, knows perfectly well that one is not supposed to do that but is doing it anyway. The possibility that individuals might have needs, desires, values, or behaviors different from those that society expects (or demands) of them was not seriously considered by functionalists .    As Parsons used the term &quot;internalization,&quot; it referred to the tendency for individuals to accept particular values and norms and to conform to them in their conduct. Dennis Wrong (1961) deplored this view of internalization as being an &quot;oversocialized&quot; conception of human beings. It left no room for the &quot;animal&quot; or biological side of human existence, where motivational drives might conflict with the discipline of internalized social norms. Functionalists deny the presence in humans &quot;of motivational forces bucking against the hold that social discipline has over them&quot; (Wrong, 1961, p. 187). Individual drives do sometimes conflict with social expectations, however. For example, a common theme in movies and TV is that of married people becoming involved in sexual relationships with persons other than their spouses. They know they are not supposed to have an affair, but they do so anyway.    Undoubtedly as a reaction to the overly determined Parsonian view of socialization, a group of interpretive sociologists has reasserted the independence of individuals . They reject Parsons's view of socialization as internalized values, norms, and habits, and they reject the notion of society as something out there (a given) that affects individuals the way Parsons suggested it did. The interpretive perspective sees socialization as an interactive process. Individuals negotiate their definitions of the situation with others. A couple, for example, may negotiate between themselves a conception of marriage that is sharply different from the view of marriage held by people in the larger society. The interpretive view offers an &quot;undersocialized&quot; view of human behavior, since it tends to minimize the importance of historical social structures and the deep internalization of social values and norms (Wentworth, 1980). But the innovative couple may find that their personally developed conception of marriage is challenged or undermined by friends, in-laws, legal systems, employers, or others.    Both the functionalist and the interpretive views of socialization are incomplete. Each is relevant for understanding some features, but both tend to ignore other important aspects of social life. It is useful to combine the helpful points of each approach into a more complete view of socialization. Wentworth (1980) proposes exactly such a synthesis. He suggests that an adequate view of socialization must leave room for free will and human autonomy, though noting the patterned social structures and processes that influence individuals. Wentworth's combined view clarifies the socialization that occurs in families, schools, groups, sports teams, organizations, and societies.    We can distinguish three major aspects of socialization:    1. The context in which it occurs    2. The actual content and processes people use to socialize others    3. The results arising from those contexts and processes    The context is like the theater or stage in which socialization occurs. Social context includes culture, language, and social structures such as the class, ethnic, and gender hierarchies of a society. Context also includes social and historical events, power and control in social life, and the people and institutions with whom individuals come in contact in the course of their socialization.    The content and process of socialization is like the play, the lines, and the actors. It includes the structure of the socializing activity--how intense and prolonged it is, who does it, how it is done, whether it is a total experience or only a partial process, how aware the individual is of alternatives, and how attractive those alternatives are. Content refers specifically to what is passed from member to novice. Processes are those interactions that convey to new members how they are to speak, behave, think, and even feel. The view of socialization as an interactive process stands in contrast to the deterministic views of how socialization occurs. Old and new members interact, and in the process exercise mutual influence on each other.    Outcomes may properly be defined as what happens later, after someone has been exposed to particular content and processes. New members may learn the behaviors, attitudes, and values that old members hoped they would learn. What do these include? First and foremost among humans is learning how to speak and to apply the rules of language to creating new sentences. Like learning to play chess, learning a language involves being shown some of the ways vocabulary and grammar can be combined (like learning how the various pieces can be moved in a chess game), and then creating one's own combinations from those possibilities. Closely related to learning to use a language is gaining a sense of the rules underlying a society's culture. Even learning to walk in an upright position appears to be the result of socialization.    THE CONTEXT OF SOCIALIZATION    Socialization occurs within biological, psychological, and social contexts. Each of these offers possibilities and limitations that may influence socialization.    The Biological Context    Biological features are regularly suggested as sources of human behavior. Sociobiologists (see Chapter 3) suggest that some human capacities may be &quot;wired into&quot; our biological makeup. For example, even newborn babies seem to strive for maximum social interaction. They move their heads back and forth in burrowing or &quot;rooting&quot; motions looking for milk; they have powerful, grasping fingers that cling tightly to other human fingers or bodies; and they move so as to maximize body contact with their caregivers. These facts suggest that infants are born wanting human contact.    Sociobiologists argue that traits which aid survival and reproduction (like learning not to eat things that induce vomiting) will survive, whereas others (like unusual whiteness in certain animals, which makes them easier prey) will tend to die out. Although this evidence suggests that biological factors clearly play a role in development, it does not show that all human behavior is biologically determined. Biology sets the stage, on which a very broad range of human behavior occurs. Most or all of the important differences between societies are due to social rather than biological factors.    As educators have become more aware of children with &quot;learning disabilities,&quot; they have begun to wonder if some conditions, such as those labeled &quot;dyslexia&quot; (that is, the inability to grasp the meaning of something one reads) are due to the incomplete development of certain nerve pathways in the brain that may scramble signals on the way to the brain, making it likely that children will &quot;see&quot; bs instead of ds , qs rather than ps , and so forth. Such problems may be part of the biological context of socialization. They may interact in significant ways with psychological and social factors during socialization and have important effects on the outcomes-- for example, if children are labeled retarded or develop a sense of worthlessness, they may be less likely to learn.    In short, biology provides rich potential for becoming human and may present general tendencies, such as the tendency to seek out social interaction or to use language, but it does not determine the particular form such social development takes.    The Psychological Context    Emotional States and the Unconscious    The primary factor in the psychological context of socialization is the psychological state of the person being socialized. Psychological states include feelings such as fear, anger, grief, love, and happiness or a sense of emotional deprivation. Strongly feeling one or more of these emotions might very well inhibit or promote socialization of a particular kind. Fear may make it difficult for young children to be socialized in school, whereas people in love may leant very quickly what makes their loved ones happy. Emotions can also influence how individuals perceive the content of socialization, whether in becoming a member of a family group or a religious sect. Knowing something about the feelings of the people involved (the psychological context) helps explain the results of the socialization process.    Cognitive Development Theories    A number of psychologists emphasize the series of stages through which humans progress. Although emotional concerns can be involved, these theorists focus on cognitive (intellectual) development, which occurs in a systematic, universal sequence through a series of stages. The most influential theorist of intellectual development was the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. A sharp observer of children's development, Piaget stressed that children need to master the skills and operations of one stage of intellectual development before they are able to learn something at the next stage.    Whether or not they all agree on the unfolding of specific stages, cognitive development theorists see children as increasingly trying to make sense of their social worlds as they grow up. Children try to see patterns in the way things happen.    Social contexts influence individual development. Culture exists before the socialization of new members begins. Parents, for example, do not need to decide alone what they arc going to teach their children, since much of what they will pass along they have themselves learned through socialization. Besides culture, individuals are affected by social and historical events and by a number of individuals who actively try to socialize them.    Social and Historical Events    Major social and historical events can be a force in socializing an entire generation. Such major events as the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Holocaust in Europe during World War II, or the civil rights movement that took shape in the United States in the 1960s have profound implications for individual socialization. Elder (1974) compared children whose families were very poor during the 1930s with others whose families were more comfortable. Those suffering greater deprivation depended less on formal education for their life achievements and more on effort and accomplishment outside of education. Their health as adults tended to be affected negatively by their economic hardships. Finally, they tended to value marriage and family more highly as a result of their economic deprivation (Elder, 1974). Thus individuals who live in extraordinary times appear to be influenced by the historical events around them.    Participants in Socialization    Obviously, parents and the immediate family of infants are important to their early care and development. Major changes in the family are increasing the importance of other caregivers as well. Teachers and schools transmit formal skills, knowledge, and social values. As infants mature, they have more and more contact with other children their age, called peers. Inevitably, children are affected by the community and nation in which they are reared. Children in the United States today spend a great deal of time with the mass media. Radio, movies, and-- most significantly--television have transformed the way we experience the world and what we know about it.    THE FAMILY . In rural societies, children have most of their early social contact with the family. Today, however, the family's importance in the child's life is changing. The American family no longer necessarily conforms to the stereotypical nuclear family with two parents and two or more dependent children. Fewer than one family in five consists of a working father, full-time homemaker mother, and at least one child. There are more and more single-parent families, and 56 percent of all mothers with children under 6 years old are working (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1985a, p. 399). More and more children are receiving their early and primary care from others in addition to their parents. What are the effects on young children of having only one parent in the home? Of having a mother who works outside the home? One study suggests that single parents with adequate financial and emotional support are able to raise their children quite effectively (Monaghan-Leckband, 1978).    Although most children growing up in America today will spend a great deal of time with people other than members of their families, this does not mean that the participation of families in socialization has ended.    On the contrary, the family continues to be a major means of passing on values, attitudes, and behaviors. As we saw in Chapter 1, in the case of Alex and Alice as compared to Albert and his wife, family origin does a great deal to shape a child's social opportunities, resources, and experience. Different social positions may be related to different socialization for children even when they live in the same society.    DAY CARE. Nearly 10 million children 5 years old or younger have mothers who work away from home. This includes 48 percent of the mothers of children 3 years old or younger. For these children, day care is an important agent of socialization. In 1982 there were more than 30,000 day-care centers, ranging from informal arrangements at the home of a neighbor to large nurseries run by schools, churches, charities, corporations, and occasionally employers (Lindsey, 1984). Figure 5.1 shows the primary childcare arrangements for children under age 5 whose mothers work outside the home.    When the ratio of staff to children is at least one to ten or lower, when the groups of children are not larger than 20, and when caregivers are trained in early childhood development and are attentive to the children, the children who attend day care do very well (Collins, 1984; Lindsey, 1984). Children from very low income families have benefited considerably over the long term as a result of federally financed Head Start and other early day-care programs (Deutsch et al., 1985; Schweinhart and Weikart, 1987).    SCHOOLS. As societies become more complex and there is a greater division of labor, family members cannot spend all day every day teaching children what they need to know to function effectively as adults in society. Therefore, most societies have established schools to teach youngsters certain skills. Schools teach values and attitudes as well. These values and attitudes include, for example, competitiveness or cooperation, conformity or innovation.    Schools try to impress upon children the importance of working for rewards, and they try to teach neatness, punctuality, orderliness, and respect for authority. Teachers are called upon to evaluate how well children perform a particular task or how much skill they have. Thus, in school, children's relationships with adults move from nurture and behavioral concerns to performance of tasks and skills determined by others.    PEERS . A peer group consists of friends and associates who are about the same age and social status. As children get older, going to school brings them into regular contact with other children of their age. As early as first or second grade, children form social groups. In these early peer groups, children learn to share toys and other scarce resources (such as the teacher's attention). Peers may reinforce behaviors that are stressed by parents and schools--for example, whether it is all right to hit someone else and what arc acceptable behaviors for boys and girls. As children move through school, the interests of peer groups may diverge more and more from those of adults. This is particularly true of the United States but seems also to be the case in certain socialist societies today. Youthful concerns may center on popular music and movies, sports, sex, or illegal activities. Parents and teachers, on the other hand, want children to do schoolwork, help at home, and &quot;stay out of trouble.&quot; Peer groups may provide social rewards--praise, prestige, and attention--to individuals for doing things adults disapprove of.    In the former Soviet Union, the peer group was used by authorities to reinforce the behaviors and attitudes they desire. For example, if a child camesto school late, it was not only the teacher who noted this (perhaps by praising children who are on time) but also those in the child's row in the classroom, who might be enlisted to urge the child to come to school on time (Bronfenbrenner, 1970). Peer sanctions (punishments) are particularly effective. In Israel, for instance, in a collective farm group, a child who breaks a rule such as using a tractor when it is not allowed and damaging the machine in the process may be formally ostracized for some time. During this period the other children will not speak to or play with the child. Although effective in achieving social goals, the united effect of peer and official authority is more powerful and painful than official authority alone for the individual who does not conform. In our society, adolescents are heavily influenced by their peers when it comes to dress, musical fads, cheating, and drug use. In making their future life plans, however, they are influenced more by their parents than by their peers (Davies and Kandel, 1981; Kandel and Lesser, 1972; Krosnick and Judd, 1982; Williams, 1972). Girls seem to be somewhat more influenced in their future life plans by peers than are boys (Bush, 1985; Davies and Kandel, 1981; Simmons et al., 1979).    COMMUNITY AND COUNTRY. Every society tries to influence how young people grow up. Much of this influence is expressed through parents, schools, and peers, but it is worth considering for a moment how children become exposed to the political and economic ideas that are considered important for citizens of a particular country.    Children learn political information and attitudes rapidly during the elementary school years, particularly between fourth and fifth grades (Hess and Torney, 1967). One of the first things they learn is that they belong to some kind of a political unit. Even very young children develop a sense of &quot;we&quot; in relation to their own country and learn to see other countries in terms of&quot;they.&quot; Children also tend to believe that their own country and language are superior to others. This bond may be the most critical socialization feature relating to the political life of the nation (Hess and Torney, 1967). The family helps provide this basic loyalty to country, but the school also shapes the political concepts that expand and develop children's early feelings of attachment. Political orientations develop early and reach nearly adult levels by the end of elementary school, but there are still some critical changes that occur at other points during the life cycle. High school students become more aware of differences between political parties and tend to become more active politically. In the first decade of adult life people modify their political orientations as they take on new occupational and family roles (Jennings and Niemi, 1968).    Children form economic ideas fairly early in life. One study examined how youngsters are socialized into capitalism. When third-graders were compared with twelfth-graders, the older students were found to hold more negative attitudes toward labor unions and more favorable attitudes toward business than did the younger children (Cummings and Taebel, 1978), suggesting that, over time, they developed attitudes that were more favorable toward capitalism, perhaps because of what they learned at school, from the media, or at home.    MASS MEDIA. The mass media include many forms of communication--such as books, magazines, radio, television, and movies--that reach large numbers of people without personal contact between senders and receivers. In the last few decades, children have been dramatically socialized by one source in particular: television. Studies have found that children spend more time watching TV than they spend in school.    It seems unbelievable that in 1945 the pollster George Gallup asked Americans, &quot;Do you know what television is?&quot; Now virtually every American home has at least one television set, and the average set is on almost 7 hours a day (Comstock et al., 1978). How has this transformation affected children? Reports vary, but children in the fifth to eighth grades view an average of 4 to 6 hours daily (B. S. Greenberg and Dervin, 1970; Lyle and Hoffman, 1972). Most of the research on the effects of television has been on the cognitive and behavioral results of TV watching. The topic most often studied has been the influence of television on antisocial behavior, especially violence. Current research supports the view that seeing violence on television increases the chance that a child will be aggressive (Comstock et al., 1978). No publicly available studies unambiguously relate changes in behavior (such as food habits or drug use) to exposure to television advertising (Comstock et al., 1978) .    Research also suggests that young people obtain considerable political and social information from television, but that how they perceive the information depends largely on parental influence (Comstock et al., 1978). For example, during the Vietnam War, television was the most important source of public information about the war. Yet how young people felt about it-- whether they favored or opposed it--seemed to be influenced more by their parents than by the opinions presented on television. Those who opposed the war interpreted the news on TV as opposing the war, whereas those favoring it saw the news as favoring it (Comstock et al., 1978).    Most researchers studying the effects of television on children have focused on the content of the programs and not on the total experience of television watching. They argue that there is too much violence and sex on children's programs and that more good educational programs for children are needed.    Winn (1977) suggests that the experience of watching television itself is limiting. When people watch television, no matter what the program, they are simply watchers and are not having any other experience. According to Winn, and many agree, children need to develop family relationships, the capacity for self direction, and the basic skills of communication (reading, writing, and speaking); to discover their own strengths and limitations, and to learn the rules that keep social interaction alive. Television works against all these goals by putting children in a passive situation where they do not speak, interact, experiment, explore, or do anything else active because they are watching a small moving picture on a machine. This research shows the growing importance of television as a medium of socialization, although clearly it is only one among a number of important influences.    Social Position as Part of the Context    Your family's social class, economic position, and ethnic background--as well as your gender--can affect the ways in which you will be socialized. People in more advantageous positions, like Alice and Alex in Chapter 1, tend to develop higher self-evaluations. As a result, they feel justified in having more resources. Similarly, those in less desired positions tend to have lower self-evaluations and may feel that their lower status is deserved (Della Fave, 1980).    Sociologists ask if children in different social classes are socialized differently. For instance are middle-class children socialized differently from lower-class children? If so, why and how? Middle-class parents are slightly less likely to use physical punishment than are lower-class parents (Gecas, 1979). Middle-class parents appear to be more concerned about their children's intentions than with the negative consequences of their actions. Thus, if a child breaks a dish a middle-class parent will be concerned with whether he or she did it &quot;on purpose&quot; or whether it was an accident, and the reaction will vary accordingly. Lower-class parents tend to react in about the same way whatever the intention of the child (Kohn, 1969).    These differences in parental response may stem from the life situations of people in different classes. Different parental experiences in the occupational world color the view of what children need to learn (Kohn, 1969, 1976; Kohn and Schooler, 1983; Pearlin, 1971).    Parents who are closely supervised on the job (more often blue-collar workers) value conformity more than do less supervised parents (usually white-collar workers). Both blue- and white-collar parents increasingly prefer more autonomy in their children, at least in the Detroit area (Alwin, 1984).    Cross-cultural studies show that members of agrarian and herding societies (where food can be accumulated and stored) tend to emphasize compliance in their socialization practices. In societies where food cannot be stored (as in hunting, gathering, or fishing economies), members more often stress individual achievement and self-reliance (Barry, Child, and Bacon, 1959).    Political structure may also be related to socialization practices. Autocratic states tend to have more &quot;severe&quot; socialization, show clear power and deference relationships, and stress obedience (Stephens, 1963). The Soviet Union, for example, works harder to socialize children to conformity than does the United States (Bronfenbrenner, 1970) . By way of contrast, tribal societies that lack a centralized or autocratic political system allow children to be less obedient and less conforming (Stephens, 1963).    All these studies suggest that parents value different traits for their children, depending on the economic, political, and social situations they face. In general, when adults have more opportunities for self-determination, they value and try to develop greater self-reliance in their children (Ellis, Lee, and Petersen, 1978). All groups try to socialize their children as well as they can, but they stress different behaviors, depending on what they see as needed in their own situation. Just as different societies may see the need for different behaviors and skills in their children, subgroups within society may do the same thing. They try to prepare their children as well as possible for the positions they are likely to hold.

Socialization    A girl named Genie was found in the United States in 1970. Genie's father had kept her locked in a room from the age of 20 months until age 13. Genie was harnessed naked to an infant's potty seat and left alone for hours and days through the years. When she was remembered at night, she was put to bed in a homemade straitjacket. There were no radios or televisions in the house, people spoke in hushed tones, and the only language Genie heard was an occasional obscenity from her father. He hated noise, and if Genie made any sound her father would growl at her like a dog or beat her with a stick. As a result of her confinement, Genie could not walk and her eyes could not focus beyond the boundaries of her room. She was malnourished, incontinent, and salivated constantly [Curtiss, 1977].     Despite all this, when the psychologist Susan Curtiss first met her, Genie was alert, curious, and intensely eager for human contact. When frightened or frustrated she would erupt into silent frenzies of rage--flailing about, scratching, spitting, throwing objects, but never uttering a sound. Aside from not speaking, her lack of socialization was apparent in her behavior: She would urinate in unacceptable places, go up to someone in a store and take whatever she liked of theirs, and peer intently into the faces of strangers at close range. Although Curtiss worked with her for several years, Genie never developed language abilities beyond those of a 4-year-old, and she ended up being placed in an institution.    The story of Genie shows the importance of socialization in human society. Socialization refers to preparing newcomers to become members of an existing group and to think, feel, and act in ways the group considers appropriate. Viewed from the group's point of view, it is a process of member replacement. Such widely diverse situations as child rearing, teaching someone a new game, orienting a new member of an organization, preparing someone who has been in sales work to become a manager, or acquainting an immigrant with the life and culture of a new society are all instances of socialization.    Socialization is a central process in social life. Its importance has been noted by sociologists for a long time, but their image of it has shifted over the last hundred years.\u00a0 In the early years of American sociology, socialization was equated with civilization. The issue was one of taming fierce individualists so they would willingly cooperate with others on common endeavors. An unruly human nature was assumed to exist prior to an individual's encounter with society. This nature had to be shaped to conform to socially acceptable ways of behaving.    As time went on, however, socialization came to be seen more and more as the end result-- that is, as internalization. Internalization means taking social norms, roles, and values into one's own mind. Society was seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learned to think and behave. This view is evident in the work of functionalist Talcott Parsons, who gave no hint that the result of socialization might be uncertain or might vary from person to person. If people failed to play their expected roles or behaved strangely, functionalists explained this in terms of incomplete or inadequate socialization. Such people were said to be &quot;unsocialized&quot;--they had not yet learned what was expected of them. The trouble is, they might very well know what was expected but simply be rejecting it. Someone who runs a red light, for example, knows perfectly well that one is not supposed to do that but is doing it anyway. The possibility that individuals might have needs, desires, values, or behaviors different from those that society expects (or demands) of them was not seriously considered by functionalists .    As Parsons used the term &quot;internalization,&quot; it referred to the tendency for individuals to accept particular values and norms and to conform to them in their conduct. Dennis Wrong (1961) deplored this view of internalization as being an &quot;oversocialized&quot; conception of human beings. It left no room for the &quot;animal&quot; or biological side of human existence, where motivational drives might conflict with the discipline of internalized social norms. Functionalists deny the presence in humans &quot;of motivational forces bucking against the hold that social discipline has over them&quot; (Wrong, 1961, p. 187). Individual drives do sometimes conflict with social expectations, however. For example, a common theme in movies and TV is that of married people becoming involved in sexual relationships with persons other than their spouses. They know they are not supposed to have an affair, but they do so anyway.    Undoubtedly as a reaction to the overly determined Parsonian view of socialization, a group of interpretive sociologists has reasserted the independence of individuals . They reject Parsons's view of socialization as internalized values, norms, and habits, and they reject the notion of society as something out there (a given) that affects individuals the way Parsons suggested it did. The interpretive perspective sees socialization as an interactive process. Individuals negotiate their definitions of the situation with others. A couple, for example, may negotiate between themselves a conception of marriage that is sharply different from the view of marriage held by people in the larger society. The interpretive view offers an &quot;undersocialized&quot; view of human behavior, since it tends to minimize the importance of historical social structures and the deep internalization of social values and norms (Wentworth, 1980). But the innovative couple may find that their personally developed conception of marriage is challenged or undermined by friends, in-laws, legal systems, employers, or others.    Both the functionalist and the interpretive views of socialization are incomplete. Each is relevant for understanding some features, but both tend to ignore other important aspects of social life. It is useful to combine the helpful points of each approach into a more complete view of socialization. Wentworth (1980) proposes exactly such a synthesis. He suggests that an adequate view of socialization must leave room for free will and human autonomy, though noting the patterned social structures and processes that influence individuals. Wentworth's combined view clarifies the socialization that occurs in families, schools, groups, sports teams, organizations, and societies.    We can distinguish three major aspects of socialization:    1. The context in which it occurs    2. The actual content and processes people use to socialize others    3. The results arising from those contexts and processes    The context is like the theater or stage in which socialization occurs. Social context includes culture, language, and social structures such as the class, ethnic, and gender hierarchies of a society. Context also includes social and historical events, power and control in social life, and the people and institutions with whom individuals come in contact in the course of their socialization.    The content and process of socialization is like the play, the lines, and the actors. It includes the structure of the socializing activity--how intense and prolonged it is, who does it, how it is done, whether it is a total experience or only a partial process, how aware the individual is of alternatives, and how attractive those alternatives are. Content refers specifically to what is passed from member to novice. Processes are those interactions that convey to new members how they are to speak, behave, think, and even feel. The view of socialization as an interactive process stands in contrast to the deterministic views of how socialization occurs. Old and new members interact, and in the process exercise mutual influence on each other.    Outcomes may properly be defined as what happens later, after someone has been exposed to particular content and processes. New members may learn the behaviors, attitudes, and values that old members hoped they would learn. What do these include? First and foremost among humans is learning how to speak and to apply the rules of language to creating new sentences. Like learning to play chess, learning a language involves being shown some of the ways vocabulary and grammar can be combined (like learning how the various pieces can be moved in a chess game), and then creating one's own combinations from those possibilities. Closely related to learning to use a language is gaining a sense of the rules underlying a society's culture. Even learning to walk in an upright position appears to be the result of socialization.    THE CONTEXT OF SOCIALIZATION    Socialization occurs within biological, psychological, and social contexts. Each of these offers possibilities and limitations that may influence socialization.    The Biological Context    Biological features are regularly suggested as sources of human behavior. Sociobiologists (see Chapter 3) suggest that some human capacities may be &quot;wired into&quot; our biological makeup. For example, even newborn babies seem to strive for maximum social interaction. They move their heads back and forth in burrowing or &quot;rooting&quot; motions looking for milk; they have powerful, grasping fingers that cling tightly to other human fingers or bodies; and they move so as to maximize body contact with their caregivers. These facts suggest that infants are born wanting human contact.    Sociobiologists argue that traits which aid survival and reproduction (like learning not to eat things that induce vomiting) will survive, whereas others (like unusual whiteness in certain animals, which makes them easier prey) will tend to die out. Although this evidence suggests that biological factors clearly play a role in development, it does not show that all human behavior is biologically determined. Biology sets the stage, on which a very broad range of human behavior occurs. Most or all of the important differences between societies are due to social rather than biological factors.    As educators have become more aware of children with &quot;learning disabilities,&quot; they have begun to wonder if some conditions, such as those labeled &quot;dyslexia&quot; (that is, the inability to grasp the meaning of something one reads) are due to the incomplete development of certain nerve pathways in the brain that may scramble signals on the way to the brain, making it likely that children will &quot;see&quot; bs instead of ds , qs rather than ps , and so forth. Such problems may be part of the biological context of socialization. They may interact in significant ways with psychological and social factors during socialization and have important effects on the outcomes-- for example, if children are labeled retarded or develop a sense of worthlessness, they may be less likely to learn.    In short, biology provides rich potential for becoming human and may present general tendencies, such as the tendency to seek out social interaction or to use language, but it does not determine the particular form such social development takes.    The Psychological Context    Emotional States and the Unconscious    The primary factor in the psychological context of socialization is the psychological state of the person being socialized. Psychological states include feelings such as fear, anger, grief, love, and happiness or a sense of emotional deprivation. Strongly feeling one or more of these emotions might very well inhibit or promote socialization of a particular kind. Fear may make it difficult for young children to be socialized in school, whereas people in love may leant very quickly what makes their loved ones happy. Emotions can also influence how individuals perceive the content of socialization, whether in becoming a member of a family group or a religious sect. Knowing something about the feelings of the people involved (the psychological context) helps explain the results of the socialization process.    Cognitive Development Theories    A number of psychologists emphasize the series of stages through which humans progress. Although emotional concerns can be involved, these theorists focus on cognitive (intellectual) development, which occurs in a systematic, universal sequence through a series of stages. The most influential theorist of intellectual development was the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. A sharp observer of children's development, Piaget stressed that children need to master the skills and operations of one stage of intellectual development before they are able to learn something at the next stage.    Whether or not they all agree on the unfolding of specific stages, cognitive development theorists see children as increasingly trying to make sense of their social worlds as they grow up. Children try to see patterns in the way things happen.    Social contexts influence individual development. Culture exists before the socialization of new members begins. Parents, for example, do not need to decide alone what they arc going to teach their children, since much of what they will pass along they have themselves learned through socialization. Besides culture, individuals are affected by social and historical events and by a number of individuals who actively try to socialize them.    Social and Historical Events    Major social and historical events can be a force in socializing an entire generation. Such major events as the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Holocaust in Europe during World War II, or the civil rights movement that took shape in the United States in the 1960s have profound implications for individual socialization. Elder (1974) compared children whose families were very poor during the 1930s with others whose families were more comfortable. Those suffering greater deprivation depended less on formal education for their life achievements and more on effort and accomplishment outside of education. Their health as adults tended to be affected negatively by their economic hardships. Finally, they tended to value marriage and family more highly as a result of their economic deprivation (Elder, 1974). Thus individuals who live in extraordinary times appear to be influenced by the historical events around them.    Participants in Socialization    Obviously, parents and the immediate family of infants are important to their early care and development. Major changes in the family are increasing the importance of other caregivers as well. Teachers and schools transmit formal skills, knowledge, and social values. As infants mature, they have more and more contact with other children their age, called peers. Inevitably, children are affected by the community and nation in which they are reared. Children in the United States today spend a great deal of time with the mass media. Radio, movies, and-- most significantly--television have transformed the way we experience the world and what we know about it.    THE FAMILY . In rural societies, children have most of their early social contact with the family. Today, however, the family's importance in the child's life is changing. The American family no longer necessarily conforms to the stereotypical nuclear family with two parents and two or more dependent children. Fewer than one family in five consists of a working father, full-time homemaker mother, and at least one child. There are more and more single-parent families, and 56 percent of all mothers with children under 6 years old are working (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1985a, p. 399). More and more children are receiving their early and primary care from others in addition to their parents. What are the effects on young children of having only one parent in the home? Of having a mother who works outside the home? One study suggests that single parents with adequate financial and emotional support are able to raise their children quite effectively (Monaghan-Leckband, 1978).    Although most children growing up in America today will spend a great deal of time with people other than members of their families, this does not mean that the participation of families in socialization has ended.    On the contrary, the family continues to be a major means of passing on values, attitudes, and behaviors. As we saw in Chapter 1, in the case of Alex and Alice as compared to Albert and his wife, family origin does a great deal to shape a child's social opportunities, resources, and experience. Different social positions may be related to different socialization for children even when they live in the same society.    DAY CARE. Nearly 10 million children 5 years old or younger have mothers who work away from home. This includes 48 percent of the mothers of children 3 years old or younger. For these children, day care is an important agent of socialization. In 1982 there were more than 30,000 day-care centers, ranging from informal arrangements at the home of a neighbor to large nurseries run by schools, churches, charities, corporations, and occasionally employers (Lindsey, 1984). Figure 5.1 shows the primary childcare arrangements for children under age 5 whose mothers work outside the home.    When the ratio of staff to children is at least one to ten or lower, when the groups of children are not larger than 20, and when caregivers are trained in early childhood development and are attentive to the children, the children who attend day care do very well (Collins, 1984; Lindsey, 1984). Children from very low income families have benefited considerably over the long term as a result of federally financed Head Start and other early day-care programs (Deutsch et al., 1985; Schweinhart and Weikart, 1987).    SCHOOLS. As societies become more complex and there is a greater division of labor, family members cannot spend all day every day teaching children what they need to know to function effectively as adults in society. Therefore, most societies have established schools to teach youngsters certain skills. Schools teach values and attitudes as well. These values and attitudes include, for example, competitiveness or cooperation, conformity or innovation.    Schools try to impress upon children the importance of working for rewards, and they try to teach neatness, punctuality, orderliness, and respect for authority. Teachers are called upon to evaluate how well children perform a particular task or how much skill they have. Thus, in school, children's relationships with adults move from nurture and behavioral concerns to performance of tasks and skills determined by others.    PEERS . A peer group consists of friends and associates who are about the same age and social status. As children get older, going to school brings them into regular contact with other children of their age. As early as first or second grade, children form social groups. In these early peer groups, children learn to share toys and other scarce resources (such as the teacher's attention). Peers may reinforce behaviors that are stressed by parents and schools--for example, whether it is all right to hit someone else and what arc acceptable behaviors for boys and girls. As children move through school, the interests of peer groups may diverge more and more from those of adults. This is particularly true of the United States but seems also to be the case in certain socialist societies today. Youthful concerns may center on popular music and movies, sports, sex, or illegal activities. Parents and teachers, on the other hand, want children to do schoolwork, help at home, and &quot;stay out of trouble.&quot; Peer groups may provide social rewards--praise, prestige, and attention--to individuals for doing things adults disapprove of.    In the former Soviet Union, the peer group was used by authorities to reinforce the behaviors and attitudes they desire. For example, if a child camesto school late, it was not only the teacher who noted this (perhaps by praising children who are on time) but also those in the child's row in the classroom, who might be enlisted to urge the child to come to school on time (Bronfenbrenner, 1970). Peer sanctions (punishments) are particularly effective. In Israel, for instance, in a collective farm group, a child who breaks a rule such as using a tractor when it is not allowed and damaging the machine in the process may be formally ostracized for some time. During this period the other children will not speak to or play with the child. Although effective in achieving social goals, the united effect of peer and official authority is more powerful and painful than official authority alone for the individual who does not conform. In our society, adolescents are heavily influenced by their peers when it comes to dress, musical fads, cheating, and drug use. In making their future life plans, however, they are influenced more by their parents than by their peers (Davies and Kandel, 1981; Kandel and Lesser, 1972; Krosnick and Judd, 1982; Williams, 1972). Girls seem to be somewhat more influenced in their future life plans by peers than are boys (Bush, 1985; Davies and Kandel, 1981; Simmons et al., 1979).    COMMUNITY AND COUNTRY. Every society tries to influence how young people grow up. Much of this influence is expressed through parents, schools, and peers, but it is worth considering for a moment how children become exposed to the political and economic ideas that are considered important for citizens of a particular country.    Children learn political information and attitudes rapidly during the elementary school years, particularly between fourth and fifth grades (Hess and Torney, 1967). One of the first things they learn is that they belong to some kind of a political unit. Even very young children develop a sense of &quot;we&quot; in relation to their own country and learn to see other countries in terms of&quot;they.&quot; Children also tend to believe that their own country and language are superior to others. This bond may be the most critical socialization feature relating to the political life of the nation (Hess and Torney, 1967). The family helps provide this basic loyalty to country, but the school also shapes the political concepts that expand and develop children's early feelings of attachment. Political orientations develop early and reach nearly adult levels by the end of elementary school, but there are still some critical changes that occur at other points during the life cycle. High school students become more aware of differences between political parties and tend to become more active politically. In the first decade of adult life people modify their political orientations as they take on new occupational and family roles (Jennings and Niemi, 1968).    Children form economic ideas fairly early in life. One study examined how youngsters are socialized into capitalism. When third-graders were compared with twelfth-graders, the older students were found to hold more negative attitudes toward labor unions and more favorable attitudes toward business than did the younger children (Cummings and Taebel, 1978), suggesting that, over time, they developed attitudes that were more favorable toward capitalism, perhaps because of what they learned at school, from the media, or at home.    MASS MEDIA. The mass media include many forms of communication--such as books, magazines, radio, television, and movies--that reach large numbers of people without personal contact between senders and receivers. In the last few decades, children have been dramatically socialized by one source in particular: television. Studies have found that children spend more time watching TV than they spend in school.    It seems unbelievable that in 1945 the pollster George Gallup asked Americans, &quot;Do you know what television is?&quot; Now virtually every American home has at least one television set, and the average set is on almost 7 hours a day (Comstock et al., 1978). How has this transformation affected children? Reports vary, but children in the fifth to eighth grades view an average of 4 to 6 hours daily (B. S. Greenberg and Dervin, 1970; Lyle and Hoffman, 1972). Most of the research on the effects of television has been on the cognitive and behavioral results of TV watching. The topic most often studied has been the influence of television on antisocial behavior, especially violence. Current research supports the view that seeing violence on television increases the chance that a child will be aggressive (Comstock et al., 1978). No publicly available studies unambiguously relate changes in behavior (such as food habits or drug use) to exposure to television advertising (Comstock et al., 1978) .    Research also suggests that young people obtain considerable political and social information from television, but that how they perceive the information depends largely on parental influence (Comstock et al., 1978). For example, during the Vietnam War, television was the most important source of public information about the war. Yet how young people felt about it-- whether they favored or opposed it--seemed to be influenced more by their parents than by the opinions presented on television. Those who opposed the war interpreted the news on TV as opposing the war, whereas those favoring it saw the news as favoring it (Comstock et al., 1978).    Most researchers studying the effects of television on children have focused on the content of the programs and not on the total experience of television watching. They argue that there is too much violence and sex on children's programs and that more good educational programs for children are needed.    Winn (1977) suggests that the experience of watching television itself is limiting. When people watch television, no matter what the program, they are simply watchers and are not having any other experience. According to Winn, and many agree, children need to develop family relationships, the capacity for self direction, and the basic skills of communication (reading, writing, and speaking); to discover their own strengths and limitations, and to learn the rules that keep social interaction alive. Television works against all these goals by putting children in a passive situation where they do not speak, interact, experiment, explore, or do anything else active because they are watching a small moving picture on a machine. This research shows the growing importance of television as a medium of socialization, although clearly it is only one among a number of important influences.    Social Position as Part of the Context    Your family's social class, economic position, and ethnic background--as well as your gender--can affect the ways in which you will be socialized. People in more advantageous positions, like Alice and Alex in Chapter 1, tend to develop higher self-evaluations. As a result, they feel justified in having more resources. Similarly, those in less desired positions tend to have lower self-evaluations and may feel that their lower status is deserved (Della Fave, 1980).    Sociologists ask if children in different social classes are socialized differently. For instance are middle-class children socialized differently from lower-class children? If so, why and how? Middle-class parents are slightly less likely to use physical punishment than are lower-class parents (Gecas, 1979). Middle-class parents appear to be more concerned about their children's intentions than with the negative consequences of their actions. Thus, if a child breaks a dish a middle-class parent will be concerned with whether he or she did it &quot;on purpose&quot; or whether it was an accident, and the reaction will vary accordingly. Lower-class parents tend to react in about the same way whatever the intention of the child (Kohn, 1969).    These differences in parental response may stem from the life situations of people in different classes. Different parental experiences in the occupational world color the view of what children need to learn (Kohn, 1969, 1976; Kohn and Schooler, 1983; Pearlin, 1971).    Parents who are closely supervised on the job (more often blue-collar workers) value conformity more than do less supervised parents (usually white-collar workers). Both blue- and white-collar parents increasingly prefer more autonomy in their children, at least in the Detroit area (Alwin, 1984).    Cross-cultural studies show that members of agrarian and herding societies (where food can be accumulated and stored) tend to emphasize compliance in their socialization practices. In societies where food cannot be stored (as in hunting, gathering, or fishing economies), members more often stress individual achievement and self-reliance (Barry, Child, and Bacon, 1959).    Political structure may also be related to socialization practices. Autocratic states tend to have more &quot;severe&quot; socialization, show clear power and deference relationships, and stress obedience (Stephens, 1963). The Soviet Union, for example, works harder to socialize children to conformity than does the United States (Bronfenbrenner, 1970) . By way of contrast, tribal societies that lack a centralized or autocratic political system allow children to be less obedient and less conforming (Stephens, 1963).    All these studies suggest that parents value different traits for their children, depending on the economic, political, and social situations they face. In general, when adults have more opportunities for self-determination, they value and try to develop greater self-reliance in their children (Ellis, Lee, and Petersen, 1978). All groups try to socialize their children as well as they can, but they stress different behaviors, depending on what they see as needed in their own situation. Just as different societies may see the need for different behaviors and skills in their children, subgroups within society may do the same thing. They try to prepare their children as well as possible for the positions they are likely to hold.

Socialization    A girl named Genie was found in the United States in 1970. Genie's father had kept her locked in a room from the age of 20 months until age 13. Genie was harnessed naked to an infant's potty seat and left alone for hours and days through the years. When she was remembered at night, she was put to bed in a homemade straitjacket. There were no radios or televisions in the house, people spoke in hushed tones, and the only language Genie heard was an occasional obscenity from her father. He hated noise, and if Genie made any sound her father would growl at her like a dog or beat her with a stick. As a result of her confinement, Genie could not walk and her eyes could not focus beyond the boundaries of her room. She was malnourished, incontinent, and salivated constantly [Curtiss, 1977].     Despite all this, when the psychologist Susan Curtiss first met her, Genie was alert, curious, and intensely eager for human contact. When frightened or frustrated she would erupt into silent frenzies of rage--flailing about, scratching, spitting, throwing objects, but never uttering a sound. Aside from not speaking, her lack of socialization was apparent in her behavior: She would urinate in unacceptable places, go up to someone in a store and take whatever she liked of theirs, and peer intently into the faces of strangers at close range. Although Curtiss worked with her for several years, Genie never developed language abilities beyond those of a 4-year-old, and she ended up being placed in an institution.    The story of Genie shows the importance of socialization in human society. Socialization refers to preparing newcomers to become members of an existing group and to think, feel, and act in ways the group considers appropriate. Viewed from the group's point of view, it is a process of member replacement. Such widely diverse situations as child rearing, teaching someone a new game, orienting a new member of an organization, preparing someone who has been in sales work to become a manager, or acquainting an immigrant with the life and culture of a new society are all instances of socialization.    Socialization is a central process in social life. Its importance has been noted by sociologists for a long time, but their image of it has shifted over the last hundred years.\u00a0 In the early years of American sociology, socialization was equated with civilization. The issue was one of taming fierce individualists so they would willingly cooperate with others on common endeavors. An unruly human nature was assumed to exist prior to an individual's encounter with society. This nature had to be shaped to conform to socially acceptable ways of behaving.    As time went on, however, socialization came to be seen more and more as the end result-- that is, as internalization. Internalization means taking social norms, roles, and values into one's own mind. Society was seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learned to think and behave. This view is evident in the work of functionalist Talcott Parsons, who gave no hint that the result of socialization might be uncertain or might vary from person to person. If people failed to play their expected roles or behaved strangely, functionalists explained this in terms of incomplete or inadequate socialization. Such people were said to be &quot;unsocialized&quot;--they had not yet learned what was expected of them. The trouble is, they might very well know what was expected but simply be rejecting it. Someone who runs a red light, for example, knows perfectly well that one is not supposed to do that but is doing it anyway. The possibility that individuals might have needs, desires, values, or behaviors different from those that society expects (or demands) of them was not seriously considered by functionalists .    As Parsons used the term &quot;internalization,&quot; it referred to the tendency for individuals to accept particular values and norms and to conform to them in their conduct. Dennis Wrong (1961) deplored this view of internalization as being an &quot;oversocialized&quot; conception of human beings. It left no room for the &quot;animal&quot; or biological side of human existence, where motivational drives might conflict with the discipline of internalized social norms. Functionalists deny the presence in humans &quot;of motivational forces bucking against the hold that social discipline has over them&quot; (Wrong, 1961, p. 187). Individual drives do sometimes conflict with social expectations, however. For example, a common theme in movies and TV is that of married people becoming involved in sexual relationships with persons other than their spouses. They know they are not supposed to have an affair, but they do so anyway.    Undoubtedly as a reaction to the overly determined Parsonian view of socialization, a group of interpretive sociologists has reasserted the independence of individuals . They reject Parsons's view of socialization as internalized values, norms, and habits, and they reject the notion of society as something out there (a given) that affects individuals the way Parsons suggested it did. The interpretive perspective sees socialization as an interactive process. Individuals negotiate their definitions of the situation with others. A couple, for example, may negotiate between themselves a conception of marriage that is sharply different from the view of marriage held by people in the larger society. The interpretive view offers an &quot;undersocialized&quot; view of human behavior, since it tends to minimize the importance of historical social structures and the deep internalization of social values and norms (Wentworth, 1980). But the innovative couple may find that their personally developed conception of marriage is challenged or undermined by friends, in-laws, legal systems, employers, or others.    Both the functionalist and the interpretive views of socialization are incomplete. Each is relevant for understanding some features, but both tend to ignore other important aspects of social life. It is useful to combine the helpful points of each approach into a more complete view of socialization. Wentworth (1980) proposes exactly such a synthesis. He suggests that an adequate view of socialization must leave room for free will and human autonomy, though noting the patterned social structures and processes that influence individuals. Wentworth's combined view clarifies the socialization that occurs in families, schools, groups, sports teams, organizations, and societies.    We can distinguish three major aspects of socialization:    1. The context in which it occurs    2. The actual content and processes people use to socialize others    3. The results arising from those contexts and processes    The context is like the theater or stage in which socialization occurs. Social context includes culture, language, and social structures such as the class, ethnic, and gender hierarchies of a society. Context also includes social and historical events, power and control in social life, and the people and institutions with whom individuals come in contact in the course of their socialization.    The content and process of socialization is like the play, the lines, and the actors. It includes the structure of the socializing activity--how intense and prolonged it is, who does it, how it is done, whether it is a total experience or only a partial process, how aware the individual is of alternatives, and how attractive those alternatives are. Content refers specifically to what is passed from member to novice. Processes are those interactions that convey to new members how they are to speak, behave, think, and even feel. The view of socialization as an interactive process stands in contrast to the deterministic views of how socialization occurs. Old and new members interact, and in the process exercise mutual influence on each other.    Outcomes may properly be defined as what happens later, after someone has been exposed to particular content and processes. New members may learn the behaviors, attitudes, and values that old members hoped they would learn. What do these include? First and foremost among humans is learning how to speak and to apply the rules of language to creating new sentences. Like learning to play chess, learning a language involves being shown some of the ways vocabulary and grammar can be combined (like learning how the various pieces can be moved in a chess game), and then creating one's own combinations from those possibilities. Closely related to learning to use a language is gaining a sense of the rules underlying a society's culture. Even learning to walk in an upright position appears to be the result of socialization.    THE CONTEXT OF SOCIALIZATION    Socialization occurs within biological, psychological, and social contexts. Each of these offers possibilities and limitations that may influence socialization.    The Biological Context    Biological features are regularly suggested as sources of human behavior. Sociobiologists (see Chapter 3) suggest that some human capacities may be &quot;wired into&quot; our biological makeup. For example, even newborn babies seem to strive for maximum social interaction. They move their heads back and forth in burrowing or &quot;rooting&quot; motions looking for milk; they have powerful, grasping fingers that cling tightly to other human fingers or bodies; and they move so as to maximize body contact with their caregivers. These facts suggest that infants are born wanting human contact.    Sociobiologists argue that traits which aid survival and reproduction (like learning not to eat things that induce vomiting) will survive, whereas others (like unusual whiteness in certain animals, which makes them easier prey) will tend to die out. Although this evidence suggests that biological factors clearly play a role in development, it does not show that all human behavior is biologically determined. Biology sets the stage, on which a very broad range of human behavior occurs. Most or all of the important differences between societies are due to social rather than biological factors.    As educators have become more aware of children with &quot;learning disabilities,&quot; they have begun to wonder if some conditions, such as those labeled &quot;dyslexia&quot; (that is, the inability to grasp the meaning of something one reads) are due to the incomplete development of certain nerve pathways in the brain that may scramble signals on the way to the brain, making it likely that children will &quot;see&quot; bs instead of ds , qs rather than ps , and so forth. Such problems may be part of the biological context of socialization. They may interact in significant ways with psychological and social factors during socialization and have important effects on the outcomes-- for example, if children are labeled retarded or develop a sense of worthlessness, they may be less likely to learn.    In short, biology provides rich potential for becoming human and may present general tendencies, such as the tendency to seek out social interaction or to use language, but it does not determine the particular form such social development takes.    The Psychological Context    Emotional States and the Unconscious    The primary factor in the psychological context of socialization is the psychological state of the person being socialized. Psychological states include feelings such as fear, anger, grief, love, and happiness or a sense of emotional deprivation. Strongly feeling one or more of these emotions might very well inhibit or promote socialization of a particular kind. Fear may make it difficult for young children to be socialized in school, whereas people in love may leant very quickly what makes their loved ones happy. Emotions can also influence how individuals perceive the content of socialization, whether in becoming a member of a family group or a religious sect. Knowing something about the feelings of the people involved (the psychological context) helps explain the results of the socialization process.    Cognitive Development Theories    A number of psychologists emphasize the series of stages through which humans progress. Although emotional concerns can be involved, these theorists focus on cognitive (intellectual) development, which occurs in a systematic, universal sequence through a series of stages. The most influential theorist of intellectual development was the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. A sharp observer of children's development, Piaget stressed that children need to master the skills and operations of one stage of intellectual development before they are able to learn something at the next stage.    Whether or not they all agree on the unfolding of specific stages, cognitive development theorists see children as increasingly trying to make sense of their social worlds as they grow up. Children try to see patterns in the way things happen.    Social contexts influence individual development. Culture exists before the socialization of new members begins. Parents, for example, do not need to decide alone what they arc going to teach their children, since much of what they will pass along they have themselves learned through socialization. Besides culture, individuals are affected by social and historical events and by a number of individuals who actively try to socialize them.    Social and Historical Events    Major social and historical events can be a force in socializing an entire generation. Such major events as the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Holocaust in Europe during World War II, or the civil rights movement that took shape in the United States in the 1960s have profound implications for individual socialization. Elder (1974) compared children whose families were very poor during the 1930s with others whose families were more comfortable. Those suffering greater deprivation depended less on formal education for their life achievements and more on effort and accomplishment outside of education. Their health as adults tended to be affected negatively by their economic hardships. Finally, they tended to value marriage and family more highly as a result of their economic deprivation (Elder, 1974). Thus individuals who live in extraordinary times appear to be influenced by the historical events around them.    Participants in Socialization    Obviously, parents and the immediate family of infants are important to their early care and development. Major changes in the family are increasing the importance of other caregivers as well. Teachers and schools transmit formal skills, knowledge, and social values. As infants mature, they have more and more contact with other children their age, called peers. Inevitably, children are affected by the community and nation in which they are reared. Children in the United States today spend a great deal of time with the mass media. Radio, movies, and-- most significantly--television have transformed the way we experience the world and what we know about it.    THE FAMILY . In rural societies, children have most of their early social contact with the family. Today, however, the family's importance in the child's life is changing. The American family no longer necessarily conforms to the stereotypical nuclear family with two parents and two or more dependent children. Fewer than one family in five consists of a working father, full-time homemaker mother, and at least one child. There are more and more single-parent families, and 56 percent of all mothers with children under 6 years old are working (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1985a, p. 399). More and more children are receiving their early and primary care from others in addition to their parents. What are the effects on young children of having only one parent in the home? Of having a mother who works outside the home? One study suggests that single parents with adequate financial and emotional support are able to raise their children quite effectively (Monaghan-Leckband, 1978).    Although most children growing up in America today will spend a great deal of time with people other than members of their families, this does not mean that the participation of families in socialization has ended.    On the contrary, the family continues to be a major means of passing on values, attitudes, and behaviors. As we saw in Chapter 1, in the case of Alex and Alice as compared to Albert and his wife, family origin does a great deal to shape a child's social opportunities, resources, and experience. Different social positions may be related to different socialization for children even when they live in the same society.    DAY CARE. Nearly 10 million children 5 years old or younger have mothers who work away from home. This includes 48 percent of the mothers of children 3 years old or younger. For these children, day care is an important agent of socialization. In 1982 there were more than 30,000 day-care centers, ranging from informal arrangements at the home of a neighbor to large nurseries run by schools, churches, charities, corporations, and occasionally employers (Lindsey, 1984). Figure 5.1 shows the primary childcare arrangements for children under age 5 whose mothers work outside the home.    When the ratio of staff to children is at least one to ten or lower, when the groups of children are not larger than 20, and when caregivers are trained in early childhood development and are attentive to the children, the children who attend day care do very well (Collins, 1984; Lindsey, 1984). Children from very low income families have benefited considerably over the long term as a result of federally financed Head Start and other early day-care programs (Deutsch et al., 1985; Schweinhart and Weikart, 1987).    SCHOOLS. As societies become more complex and there is a greater division of labor, family members cannot spend all day every day teaching children what they need to know to function effectively as adults in society. Therefore, most societies have established schools to teach youngsters certain skills. Schools teach values and attitudes as well. These values and attitudes include, for example, competitiveness or cooperation, conformity or innovation.    Schools try to impress upon children the importance of working for rewards, and they try to teach neatness, punctuality, orderliness, and respect for authority. Teachers are called upon to evaluate how well children perform a particular task or how much skill they have. Thus, in school, children's relationships with adults move from nurture and behavioral concerns to performance of tasks and skills determined by others.    PEERS . A peer group consists of friends and associates who are about the same age and social status. As children get older, going to school brings them into regular contact with other children of their age. As early as first or second grade, children form social groups. In these early peer groups, children learn to share toys and other scarce resources (such as the teacher's attention). Peers may reinforce behaviors that are stressed by parents and schools--for example, whether it is all right to hit someone else and what arc acceptable behaviors for boys and girls. As children move through school, the interests of peer groups may diverge more and more from those of adults. This is particularly true of the United States but seems also to be the case in certain socialist societies today. Youthful concerns may center on popular music and movies, sports, sex, or illegal activities. Parents and teachers, on the other hand, want children to do schoolwork, help at home, and &quot;stay out of trouble.&quot; Peer groups may provide social rewards--praise, prestige, and attention--to individuals for doing things adults disapprove of.    In the former Soviet Union, the peer group was used by authorities to reinforce the behaviors and attitudes they desire. For example, if a child camesto school late, it was not only the teacher who noted this (perhaps by praising children who are on time) but also those in the child's row in the classroom, who might be enlisted to urge the child to come to school on time (Bronfenbrenner, 1970). Peer sanctions (punishments) are particularly effective. In Israel, for instance, in a collective farm group, a child who breaks a rule such as using a tractor when it is not allowed and damaging the machine in the process may be formally ostracized for some time. During this period the other children will not speak to or play with the child. Although effective in achieving social goals, the united effect of peer and official authority is more powerful and painful than official authority alone for the individual who does not conform. In our society, adolescents are heavily influenced by their peers when it comes to dress, musical fads, cheating, and drug use. In making their future life plans, however, they are influenced more by their parents than by their peers (Davies and Kandel, 1981; Kandel and Lesser, 1972; Krosnick and Judd, 1982; Williams, 1972). Girls seem to be somewhat more influenced in their future life plans by peers than are boys (Bush, 1985; Davies and Kandel, 1981; Simmons et al., 1979).    COMMUNITY AND COUNTRY. Every society tries to influence how young people grow up. Much of this influence is expressed through parents, schools, and peers, but it is worth considering for a moment how children become exposed to the political and economic ideas that are considered important for citizens of a particular country.    Children learn political information and attitudes rapidly during the elementary school years, particularly between fourth and fifth grades (Hess and Torney, 1967). One of the first things they learn is that they belong to some kind of a political unit. Even very young children develop a sense of &quot;we&quot; in relation to their own country and learn to see other countries in terms of&quot;they.&quot; Children also tend to believe that their own country and language are superior to others. This bond may be the most critical socialization feature relating to the political life of the nation (Hess and Torney, 1967). The family helps provide this basic loyalty to country, but the school also shapes the political concepts that expand and develop children's early feelings of attachment. Political orientations develop early and reach nearly adult levels by the end of elementary school, but there are still some critical changes that occur at other points during the life cycle. High school students become more aware of differences between political parties and tend to become more active politically. In the first decade of adult life people modify their political orientations as they take on new occupational and family roles (Jennings and Niemi, 1968).    Children form economic ideas fairly early in life. One study examined how youngsters are socialized into capitalism. When third-graders were compared with twelfth-graders, the older students were found to hold more negative attitudes toward labor unions and more favorable attitudes toward business than did the younger children (Cummings and Taebel, 1978), suggesting that, over time, they developed attitudes that were more favorable toward capitalism, perhaps because of what they learned at school, from the media, or at home.    MASS MEDIA. The mass media include many forms of communication--such as books, magazines, radio, television, and movies--that reach large numbers of people without personal contact between senders and receivers. In the last few decades, children have been dramatically socialized by one source in particular: television. Studies have found that children spend more time watching TV than they spend in school.    It seems unbelievable that in 1945 the pollster George Gallup asked Americans, &quot;Do you know what television is?&quot; Now virtually every American home has at least one television set, and the average set is on almost 7 hours a day (Comstock et al., 1978). How has this transformation affected children? Reports vary, but children in the fifth to eighth grades view an average of 4 to 6 hours daily (B. S. Greenberg and Dervin, 1970; Lyle and Hoffman, 1972). Most of the research on the effects of television has been on the cognitive and behavioral results of TV watching. The topic most often studied has been the influence of television on antisocial behavior, especially violence. Current research supports the view that seeing violence on television increases the chance that a child will be aggressive (Comstock et al., 1978). No publicly available studies unambiguously relate changes in behavior (such as food habits or drug use) to exposure to television advertising (Comstock et al., 1978) .    Research also suggests that young people obtain considerable political and social information from television, but that how they perceive the information depends largely on parental influence (Comstock et al., 1978). For example, during the Vietnam War, television was the most important source of public information about the war. Yet how young people felt about it-- whether they favored or opposed it--seemed to be influenced more by their parents than by the opinions presented on television. Those who opposed the war interpreted the news on TV as opposing the war, whereas those favoring it saw the news as favoring it (Comstock et al., 1978).    Most researchers studying the effects of television on children have focused on the content of the programs and not on the total experience of television watching. They argue that there is too much violence and sex on children's programs and that more good educational programs for children are needed.    Winn (1977) suggests that the experience of watching television itself is limiting. When people watch television, no matter what the program, they are simply watchers and are not having any other experience. According to Winn, and many agree, children need to develop family relationships, the capacity for self direction, and the basic skills of communication (reading, writing, and speaking); to discover their own strengths and limitations, and to learn the rules that keep social interaction alive. Television works against all these goals by putting children in a passive situation where they do not speak, interact, experiment, explore, or do anything else active because they are watching a small moving picture on a machine. This research shows the growing importance of television as a medium of socialization, although clearly it is only one among a number of important influences.    Social Position as Part of the Context    Your family's social class, economic position, and ethnic background--as well as your gender--can affect the ways in which you will be socialized. People in more advantageous positions, like Alice and Alex in Chapter 1, tend to develop higher self-evaluations. As a result, they feel justified in having more resources. Similarly, those in less desired positions tend to have lower self-evaluations and may feel that their lower status is deserved (Della Fave, 1980).    Sociologists ask if children in different social classes are socialized differently. For instance are middle-class children socialized differently from lower-class children? If so, why and how? Middle-class parents are slightly less likely to use physical punishment than are lower-class parents (Gecas, 1979). Middle-class parents appear to be more concerned about their children's intentions than with the negative consequences of their actions. Thus, if a child breaks a dish a middle-class parent will be concerned with whether he or she did it &quot;on purpose&quot; or whether it was an accident, and the reaction will vary accordingly. Lower-class parents tend to react in about the same way whatever the intention of the child (Kohn, 1969).    These differences in parental response may stem from the life situations of people in different classes. Different parental experiences in the occupational world color the view of what children need to learn (Kohn, 1969, 1976; Kohn and Schooler, 1983; Pearlin, 1971).    Parents who are closely supervised on the job (more often blue-collar workers) value conformity more than do less supervised parents (usually white-collar workers). Both blue- and white-collar parents increasingly prefer more autonomy in their children, at least in the Detroit area (Alwin, 1984).    Cross-cultural studies show that members of agrarian and herding societies (where food can be accumulated and stored) tend to emphasize compliance in their socialization practices. In societies where food cannot be stored (as in hunting, gathering, or fishing economies), members more often stress individual achievement and self-reliance (Barry, Child, and Bacon, 1959).    Political structure may also be related to socialization practices. Autocratic states tend to have more &quot;severe&quot; socialization, show clear power and deference relationships, and stress obedience (Stephens, 1963). The Soviet Union, for example, works harder to socialize children to conformity than does the United States (Bronfenbrenner, 1970) . By way of contrast, tribal societies that lack a centralized or autocratic political system allow children to be less obedient and less conforming (Stephens, 1963).    All these studies suggest that parents value different traits for their children, depending on the economic, political, and social situations they face. In general, when adults have more opportunities for self-determination, they value and try to develop greater self-reliance in their children (Ellis, Lee, and Petersen, 1978). All groups try to socialize their children as well as they can, but they stress different behaviors, depending on what they see as needed in their own situation. Just as different societies may see the need for different behaviors and skills in their children, subgroups within society may do the same thing. They try to prepare their children as well as possible for the positions they are likely to hold.

Waksler, 1991]    Chapter 2    Beyond Socialization   Frances Chaput Waksler         Introduction    The purpose of this chapter is to set forth some major criticisms that can be made of the concept of socialization as it is formulated and used by sociologists. To identify problems is not necessarily to provide resolutions, but clearly it is a fundamental step in that process.   The Bergers' description of socialization was chosen for inclusion as Chapter 1 and for criticism in this chapter because theirs is a particularly sophisticated introductory treatment. While they avoid the pitfalls inherent in overly simplified presentations, the very clarity of their work sets in relief problematic aspects of the concept of socialization. Such problems characterize virtually all introductory treatments (see for example, Robertson, 1989 and Vander Zanden 1990). In this chapter, the specific criticisms to be put forth center around two general features of socialization: the concept itself and its range.     The Concept Itself    Is socialization the name for an identifiable and documentable process whose existence is subject to proof or refutation, or is it rather the name for an assumption made to organize a wide range of activities? Either can prove useful to understanding but they are in no sense interchangeable. What follows is not dependent upon either answer to the question posed, though the ideas presented lead towards the conclusion that the concept of socialization names an assumption rather than an empirically verifiable process. (In Chapter 3, Mackay argues that the concept as it is currently constituted is not a sociological concept at all but merely an everyday adult view of children.)     The Range of the Concept    In the Sociological literature, studies of socialization have focused extensively on children and the study of children has been conducted primarily in terms of socialization. As a consequence socialization of children and of adults have been conceived of as different rather than similar processes as evidenced for example in the distinction between initial and secondary socialization. Children's activities unrelated to socialization have been until quite recently minimally investigated by sociologists. The range of the concept of socialization can thus be said to be both too narrow (when it focuses only on children) and too broad (when it serves as the major way to understand children) .   In what follows I first discuss an important distinction sociologists make between initial and secondary socialization, a topic touched upon in the previous chapter. This distinction assumes the existence of clear differences between adults and children and obscures similarities. Next I consider Dennis Wrong's classic criticism of socialization. Then I provide some further criticisms of the concept and locate the source of many of the problems in adult taken-for-granted assumptions. Lastly, I suggest some ways that the concept of socialization might be modified and the advantages to be gained from moving beyond the concept altogether.    Initial and Secondary Socialization    Face-to-face interaction is the fundamental setting for socialization. When individuals are together sharing time and space able to see and hear and feel the actions of each as responses to the actions of the other, a very special situation occurs for learning about others, one's self and one's impact on the world. Socialization can take place in a variety of settings but face-to-face interaction as the prototypical social experience (Berger and Luckmann, 1966), is the key one.   Sociologists identify two different kinds of socialization: initial (or primary) and secondary. Initial socialization refers to those processes that take place first-- learning one's first language, discovering one's first 'others', encountering one's first rules. Two characteristics of initial socialization are particularly crucial for the unfolding of the process: 1) The agent of socialization (the person carrying out the process) has power over the person being socialized. In the extreme this power can be that over life and death. Although this claim may sound a bit strong, in fact adults have such power over infants as the extensive evidence on child abuse makes clear. That adults do not routinely make full use of their power does not eliminate it; social limits on that power can be overcome. Exactly how children perceive the power of adults is unknown but there is no reason for assuming that they are unaware of it. 2) The person being socialized has no prior experience of that being inculcated. Compare the difference between learning one's first language and learning a second. In learning a second, one can translate into terms of the first, use the first as a basis, etc. One's first language is learned in a sense through faith--faith that what others are teaching has meaning, is worth trying and/or somehow works.   Secondary socialization differs in one very basic respect from initial socialization: it comes after initial socialization. Those undergoing secondary socialization have already been socialized and thus may be either more receptive or more defensive towards the new ideas and actions to which they are being socialized. To be born into a religion and practice it throughout one's life is very different from converting from one religion to another; in the latter process, one has both more choice (e.g. the very choice of converting or abandoning the endeavor) and more limits (e.g. the difficulty or even impossibility of coming to believe something that one had previously thought unbelievable). Secondary socialization is most successful in bringing about fundamental changes in people when the conditions under which it occurs most closely approximate those of childhood, i.e. when the one being socialized is dependent on the agents of socialization, has significantly less power than they, and has little access to outsiders. To illustrate secondary socialization when it adopts some of the fundamental features of initial socializations, sociologists commonly offer the examples of the novitiate/ seminary and of basic training in the military sphere. Typically, however, secondary socialization is less extensive and more congruent with earlier socialization.   Sociological studies of children tend to focus on initial (primary) socialization, routinely assuming that children come into the world 'empty', to be filled with the social ideas of the groups into which they are born. Even those who articulate objections to such an assumption may implicitly use it nonetheless. Sociological studies have explored both of the earlier-mentioned aspects of socialization-- becoming a group member and developing a self --by focusing on who gets socialized by whom to what with what outcomes. What is neglected in such an approach, by being assumed as nonproblematic, is what the one being socialized is doing at the time-- both with reference to the socialization process and to other projects that person has in mind. By slapping a child when that child tries to touch a hot stove, one may indeed socialize that child to keep away from that stove and even stoves in general, but 1) the child may not have planned to touch the stove but simply see how close one could get, already 'knowing' not to touch it and 2) the child's activities, whatever they are, are aborted.   Two fundamental criticisms can be addressed to the concept of socialization at this point. First, the concept of initial socialization in particular assumes that children are 'empty buckets' who readily contain whatever is poured into them. If, however, there is something already in the bucket (e.g. children's own experiences), the resulting contents are of necessity different from that which was poured in. In such cases, what has been studied as initial socialization may in fact be an outcome of secondary socialization. Second, the concept assumes the existence of an agent of socialization and an object of socialization and thus a one-way process that neglects the reciprocity that is the very heart of sociology's subject matter. (Indeed the Bergers do refer to this reciprocity, but nonetheless they focus on the child and offer no examples of children affecting adults.)     'The Oversocialized Conception of Man'    Dennis H. Wrong, in an article entitled \"The Oversocialized Conception of Man in Modern Sociology\" (1961), provides what has come to be viewed as a classic critique the concept of socialization. Even though his objections have been widely accepted, they have not led to sufficient modification of the concept to render his criticisms obsolete.   In his article Wrong argues that overuse and overextension of the concept of socialization has obscured that which it has claimed to study. He begins by considering one of the central questions of sociological inquiry: How is it possible that people follow social rules? One common sociological answer is: Because they are socialized to do so. Wrong finds this answer unsatisfactory, for it suggests that rule-following automatically follows socialization, that once socialized one has no choice but to follow those rules to which one was socialized, and thus that the question itself is trivial. If, as Wrong argues, the question is an important one, then any answer that trivializes it is suspect. In everyday conversation, it is not uncommon to explain why one has done something by claiming: 'That is how I learned to do it' or 'That is how I was brought up.' The insufficiency of such explanations can be demonstrated by posing the questions: Do you do everything as you learned to do it? Do you do everything that you were brought up to do? More accurate and fruitful as an empirical question is: Of those things one has learned to do/been brought up to do, which does one adopt and which does one not? This questions keeps alive the question: How is it possible that humans follow social rules? for it keeps it a question in search of an answer rather than setting it as a question with the automatic answer, socialization.   Wrong claims that the very significance of this and other fundamental questions in sociology is that they may never be answered definitively and for all times because of their complexity, but, nonetheless, their very existence serves as a basis for continued exploration and thought. New sociological studies continually make possible reconsideration of answers to these central questions, but any facile and definitive answers are suspect, for they obscure the essentially problematic nature of the questions themselves.   Although he does not criticize the concept of socialization in itself, Wrong does fault the way it has been used by sociologists. Without denying that human beings are socialized or that they internalize social norms, he argues that socialization cannot explain all human behavior, or even all rule-following behavior. He offers objections to the 'empty bucket' theory of human nature, the idea that people are born are born without any social or personal ideas and that through the socialization process this empty bucket is filled with the ideas of the social groups in which socialization takes place. The view he criticizes is called social determinism , for it claims that individual behavior is determined by the social world. In everyday talk it is exemplified in the statement made to explain one's behavior: 'Society made me do it.' Such a view in its extreme form rejects the possibility of independent human action and choice.   In everyday life it may be common to see the behavior of others as socially determined, but seldom does one apply such a notion to one's own behavior, except perhaps as a justification to others. When one seeks explanation for one's own behavior, the idea that something lying outside made one act in a particular way is more likely to be viewed as an attempt to avoid responsibility for one's acts. If indeed it is true that social determinism is found wanting when applied to one's own behavior and only plausible when applied to the behavior of others, then the theory itself should be viewed with suspicion, for it fails to explain one's own experiences, those with which one is most familiar. If any theory fails to explain one's own experiences, it may be that it explains nobody's experiences. Any theory that creates a division beween the theorist and those theorized about and that can only explain the latter contains some basic flaw.   Wrong argues that the process of internalization is not nearly as inevitable or as unproblematic as some sociologists take it to be. Indeed social ideas do become a part of the individual through internalization, but such a process is always incomplete and tentative. A focus on internalization also ignores other forces in the social world that encourage rule-following behavior. People certainly do follow rules they have internalized, but they are not compelled to do so, for one indeed may violate rules in which one believes. And people also follow rules they have not internalized, as when they engage in or forgo behavior in order to avoid punishment. In studies of social control, sociologists certainly recognize that the existence of punishment can inhibit occurrences of behavior in which people might otherwise engage, but discussions of socialization customarily minimize this aspect of rule-following.   While recognizing the two different aspects of socialization --creation of group members and creation of the self--Wrong emphasizes that these two processes are not identical and in any given instance may be  either antithetical or sympathetic. Sociologists have focused on the sympathetic dimension of this process --what's good for the group is good for the individual; Freud (see especially Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930) focused on the antithetical dimension, the sacrifices the group requires of the self. Wrong urges a more balanced view which, while more ambiguous and complex, is more reflective of the social worlds in which we live and act.     Further Criticisms    Against the background of the concepts of initial and secondary socialization and Wrong's criticisms, we can now consider specific objections that can be made to the concept of socialization. The Bergers' presentation in the foregoing chapter is by no means the naive approach to the topic Wrong faults; indeed it displays many insights. Nonetheless, their rendition of the socialization process includes a number of commonly made claims that can be viewed as problematic. The objections that can be made to their presentation are even more applicable to less clear and sophisticated formulations.   The Bergers [In this discussion, particular attention is focused on those passages in the Bergers's article that were printed in bold type.] retain the notions of children as 'empty buckers' and the agents of socialization as routinely successful in their endeavors. They Claim that children as a matter of course  accept the patterns that surround them as the only possible patterns, for those patterns 'are experienced in a very absolute way, (Berger and Berger, p. 6). Although examples can be offered in abundance to show that children do experience their own ways in absolute terms, as the only ways -- the author was reprimanded by a 3-year-old for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 'the wrong way', putting the peanut butter on one slice of bread and the jelly on another rather than putting the jelly on the peanut butter-- the issue to be raised here is not: Can children experience the world in absolute terms? for indeed they can, but: Must they do so? Over-dependence on the notion of socialization impedes the very asking of such a question.   Evidence also exists, however, that children do experience at least some aspects of their world in their own terms and in contrast to others' views, providing children with at least the possibility of relativism. Food preferences may serve as one example, for the youngest of children may display likes and dislikes that defy adult efforts at modification and that those children maintain into adulthood, when they have more power to carry through on their own preferences. One might argue that food preferences can be biologically based; other examples, however, can be offered. Children who 'always wanted a pet' may resist all adult efforts to eradicate the idea and may find in adulthood that they both enjoy having a pet and feel they would have done so in childhood. Children's conceptions of the aesthetic and practical qualities of insects can be quite at odds with the views of those with whom they associate; where then do their ideas come from? (To suggest that ideas come from peers simply pushes the problem back a step. Where did peers get their ideas?) In a more general sense, children may perceive a diffuse sense of a gap or a 'wrong' in their lives. That they do not have the power to implement their alternative views and that adults can deny that there is any gap or 'wrong' does not mean that children accept the world around them in absolute terms; it only means that they appear to do so.   The assumption that agents of socialization are routinely successful in their endeavors is captured in the Bergers' statement that ithe probable outcome of any conflict [between child and adult] is a victory on the part of the adults' (Berger and Berger, p. 6). Rather than making assumptions about the results of any such conflicts, it would be more scientific to take such outcomes as problematic. What constitutes victory, what defeat? For whom is a midnight feeding a victory? When the outcome of adult/child conflicts is viewed as problematic, it becomes possible to consider, for instance, the power resources that children have available to them, resources that may make it possible for them to achieve victories. Children's resources may differ from those available to adults but they are not thereby either negligible or ineffective. Adult power over children ultimately rests on the fact that they have control over children's life and death; conversely, children have the power to die--power that failure-to-thrive children might be said to display. The results of attempts to bottle-feed a child accustomed to the breast are not so certain as the Bergers' claim would suggest.   What are the criteria for judging the success of socialization? One such criterion might be parental claims of their own success: 'My children turned out just the way I wanted them to.' Such claims are so rare that they can hardly be put forward as self-evident proof that socialization is routinely successful. In the absence of criteria for judging the success of socialization, any such claims appear more a matter of faith than evidence. Empirical study of the success and failure of various socialization endeavors would seem necessary before any scientific claims could be made.   Although it might seem that knowledge drawn from the natural sciences could inform the notion of socialization, rendering it more scientific, in fact the natural sciences themselves are not immune to the social context in which they develop. Medical statements, to all appearances scientific, are made about children's 'needs'. Such apparently absolute claims, however, routinely embody, albeit implicitly, conditional claims: these needs must be fulfilled if one is to emerge a human being of the kind recognizable in the biologist's society and if one is to avoid certain outcomes judged as negative in that society. Children need three balanced meals a day only if they are to have access to the health advantages deemed important in a given society. But not all societies structure food consumption around three meals--some have fewer, some more and what is viewed as an avoidable nutritional or medical problem in one society can be viewed, in another society, as unavoidable or even 'normal'. In the not too distant past in the US, it was normal for a woman to lose at least some of the children she bore to childhood diseases--so normal that the answer to the question 'How many children do you have?' could routinely be 'Seven living'.   Statements drawn from the natural sciences about children's abilities and inabilities may well serve as blinders, preventing the recognition of what children can do, especially those children who do that which science tends to assume they cannot. Child prodigies--6-year-old mathematicians and virtuoso violinists --are taken to be exceptional. Would there be more child prodigies if they were seen as normal? There are societies where 3-, 4-, and 5-year-olds live almost entirely without adult supervision, where 13-year-old females routinely bear and rear children, and where young children themselves have the care and responsibility of those younger. Whether or not such practices are desirable is a moral issue that has no relevance for whether or not the practices are possible, as indeed they are. That people in the US do not socialize children to be mothers at age 13 obviously does not mean that they cannot be mothers. To see negative implications of such practices and to choose to avoid them does not drive them out of existence as possibilities.   Many of the criticisms that can be directed to the concept of socialization have in common their source in sociologists' failures to explore their taken-for-granted assumptions about their own social worlds and in particular about children in those social worlds. In Chapter 5 I describe some of the assumptions that adults make about children that, when made by sociologists, can distort the data they collect. In the next section I detail three notable and consequential assumptions that are embedded in socialization as it is used conceptually by sociologists.     Taken-for-granted Assumptions    The sociological literature on socialization embodies two assumptions, seldom investigated or-even recognized, that are embodied in the following two renditions of the same sentence:   Parents routinely socialize their children.  Parents routinely socialize their children.   With respect to the first formulation, indeed it does happen throughout the world that the biological parents of children rear those children. And it also happens that children are reared primarily by others: step-parents, adoptive parents, foster parents, one parent (and the usage of the term parent in all these terms should not delude us into thinking those to whom the term is applied are interchangeable and the same), siblings, other relatives, friends, affiliates of social service and charitable agencies, nannies and nursemaids, day care workers, and so on. The assumption in the sociological literature, however, is that parents or those acting like parents (whatever that might entail) are the primary agents of socialization. (See both Robertson, 1989 and Vander Zanden, 1990 for discussions of the family as the major agent of initial socialization.) Support for the assumption that sociologists have made about the primacy of parents, however, is provided far more by the ideological status of the family in the US and in the West in general than by the data. A fresh look at arrangements throughout the world and a genuine asking of the question 'Who socializes children?' would seem to be in order.   The claim that parents routinely socialize their children can be read in a second way, emphasizing not  parents but the term socialize. Such a reading brings to light a second unexamined assumption, namely that parents routinely socialize their children. The first issue to raise here is: How is 'socializing children' to be distinguished from the other activities that adults direct towards children? Could one, for example, reasonably ask on a questionnaire: How much time per day do you spend socializing your children? If socialization is viewed as an intentional activity engaged in by an agent of socialization, perhaps the questionnaire question could be answered. If, on the other hand, socialization is viewed as the outcome of myriad activities, intentional and unintentional, successful and unsuccessful, measured only by manifestations in adult behavior, and if socialization is so inextricably linked to child-rearing in general, how can it be studied sociologically as an independent phenomenon?   Although it is certainly the case in the US, for instance, that the task of socializing children is ideologically and legally assigned to the parents of those children, it does not follow that those parents always and necessarily do socialize their children. Indeed such an inference is contradicted by ample evidence of parents who neglect their children (in the sense of ignoring them), whose acts towards children are directed largely to controlling them (in the sense of preventing them from being a disruption to adult activities), or whose notion of socializing children departs radically from the social norms (as can been seen in the regularly appearing stories in sensational newspapers of children caged, chained, etc. 'for their own good'). That children learn from their experiences is indisputable, but the application of the term socialization to the above examples appears to be a distortion of either the concept or the experiences or both. Can children who have the kinds of experiences described in this paragraph be said to be socialized? If so, by whom? And to what?   In descriptions of socialization, adults are likely to appear as deity-like figures, solely concerned with the welfare of their charges and subsuming their own needs to those of children. Adults appear as kindly, loving, both motivated to socialize children to the broader society and equal to that task. Such a glowing picture has far more in common with an ideological than a scientific formulation. Interestingly enough, when examples are provided of children who have been isolated from human contact, caged, chained, etc., attention centers on what can be learned about the importance of sociahzation for children. Such examples can also be, though seldom are, read as challenges to the view that all adults actively and competently socialize their children.   Yet a third taken-for-granted assumption underlying socialization is that there is only one available social group --commonly termed 'society'-- to which one can be socialized. While the sociological literature on deviance does address the issue of groups competing to socialize individuals, e.g. the family and the gang, such competition is not routinely addressed in theoretical presentations of the concept of socialization. When it is addressed, it tends to be as an explanation of some particular discrepancy-- a 'good' child from a 'bad' home, a 'bad' child from a 'good' home--rather than as a general feature of the socialization process. An assumption of social homogeneity obscures consideration of the groups that might compete for individuals, but once such competition is recognized as a possibility, it can be sought in such situations as disagreements in child-rearing between spouses, between parents and teachers (see, for example, Goode with Waksler, 1990), between church and state, and between and among any competing groups which in some sense have access to the same individual.   Taken-for-granted assumptions embodied in the idea that parents socialize children obscure from view the many situations where socialization is done by others and where parents' activities directed towards children are either occasionally or primarily oriented to goals other than socialization. The assumption that there is only one group society -- to which one is socialized obscures from view alternative groups, groups that may well vie with one another for members/followers.     Socialization and Beyond    In the foregoing I have presented some fundamental criticisms of the notion of socialization. Pervading the presentation is the idea that socialization as it is generally employed by sociologists obscures from view significant aspects of children's and adults' social behavior. Refinement of the concept by setting as problematic aspects heretofore taken for granted as true could make some of these aspects available for study. In reconceptualizing socialization I would recommend directing particular attention to the following kinds of questions:   1. Is socialization the name for an identifiable and documentable process or is it the name for an assumption made to organize a wide range of activities;   2. In what respects are the socialization of children and adults (both initial and secondary) different processes and in what respects are they similar?   3. When socialization is taking place, what is the one being socialized doing at the time --both with reference to the socialization process and to other projects that person has in mind?   4. Are children empty buckets who readily contain what is poured into them? If not, and I suspect that there is general sociological agreement that they are not, what do they contain and what are the implications of these contents for socialization?   5. Is socialization best understood as a one-way process between an agent of socialization and an object of socialization or is it better conceived of as a reciprocal relationship with each influencing the other?   6. Are agents of socialization routinely successful in their endeavors? What are the criteria for judging the success of socialization? Setting as problematic the outcomes of socialization would seem to be a more scientific approach than making assumptions about those outcomes.   7. Who routinely socializes children? How, specifically, do they go about it. Taking these to be empirical questions rather than rhetorical ones would seem fruitful.   8. Of the many activities that adults and children participate in together, which ones can be identified as socialization? Which ones cannot?   9 Is there only one group (society) to which children are socialized or are there alternative groups, groups which may well vie with one another for members/followers? If there is competition and conflict, documentation would seem to be In order.   10. How can socialization best be studied to preserve the integrity of the fundamental sociological questions (e.g. those identified by Wrong) ?   Even if the concept of socialization were modified to take into account the questions posed above, it could never encompass the entirety of children's experiences, for children do more than 'get socialized'. To expect any single concept to have such range and such explanatory power is in all likelihood unreasonable. Just as the concept of family does not explain all of the experiences of family members, and just as the concept of deviance omits the non-deviant aspects of those labeled deviant, the concept of socialization omits aspects of children's behavior (and of adults' behavior as well). In particular it leaves out both what children are doing when others are socializing them, and when others are not. It neglects the worlds that children design by themselves for themselves. It fails to examine children's ideas and activities as their ways of being in the world. Furthermore, these omissions are not shortcomings of the concept itself and cannot be rectified by modifying the concept; they are a necessary consequence of the fact that socialization is only one way of looking at children.   Thus I recommend moving beyond socialization to consider other ways of looking at children's lives. No systematic theoretical guidelines are readily available in the sociological literature, but some guidelines are explicit in the work of a number of sociologists. Two major approachers can be inferred from that work: 1) to consider studies conducted from an adult perspective not as findings about children but as data on how adults can view children and thus on the adult worlds in which children live (a perspective I have labeled 'children in an adult world') and 2) to conduct studies from children's perspectives (a perspective I refer to as 'children in a child's world'). The selections in Parts II and III of this book provide examples of both of these perspectives and thus of what can be learned about children by going beyond socialization.     Endnote    In this chapter I have raised criticisms about the ways that sociologists have studied children and indicated alternative approaches. Before considering data from those alternative perspectives, however, it will be helpful to learn what other sociological critics have to recommend. In Chapter 3, Mackay, drawing on data gathered in a classroom setting, shows the complexity and subtlety of the knowledge children need to possess simply to carry out classroom tasks, features that are obscured when one limits oneself to an adult perspective.       This article is included to make us think about our taken-for-granted categories, as we try to look more closely at children and students from their perspectives, not from our own."}]}]
