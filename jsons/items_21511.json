Whether you're looking to enhance your existing social media strategy or just getting started with a new account, you've come to the right place. As social media usage continues to flourish here and in higher education as a whole, it's important that we take these efforts seriously.   This page is designed to help you, as the community manager or administrator of an NYU-focused account, to get started and to answer any questions that you may have regarding social media for University departments and organizations. The information provided is designed to enhance your social media strategy and help you meet your goals and benchmarks.              Social Media Best Practices          At NYU, we believe the use of social media is a way to digitally connect and communicate with others -- friends, classmates, colleagues, and sometimes strangers. The strength of social media is that it is built upon real relationships between people, with technology enabling people to easily connect with others around the world -- carrying messages quickly to others near and far.    Additionally, social networking (both on NYU-provided services and on commercially-available services) can help to support the University mission of teaching, learning, research, and community life.          Learn more about best practicies              Social Media Ambassadors          The Social Media Ambassadors is a group intended for employees who take part in managing social media on behalf of an NYU entity (i.e. office, department, school, etc.). The group is designed to facilitate community amongst the members increasing knowledge, awareness, and best practices in the areas of social media at NYU.    The group meets twice a semester for in-person meetings and communicates throughout the year using the Social Media Ambassadors Google Group.    Members should be active managers and administrators of a NYU social media account. An NYU.edu account is required to join.

Admit when you make mistakes and correct inaccurate information. Consider that you are in an academic environment and the implications of utilizing a NYU-provided platform that automatically identifies you in your role at NYU.          BE SMART          Social media is \u201creal life.\u201d Behavior in social media is no different than in e-mail, public speech, classroom lecture, conversation with friends, or a poster on a wall. Anything considered inappropriate offline is likely also inappropriate online. When in doubt about whether to share or not, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.          BE THOUGHTFUL          Be mindful of what is considered appropriate behavior in different countries and cultures around the world and of how your words, actions, and images may be perceived. Know your audience and think before you post.          BE RESPECTFUL          Social media provides a place to foster community and conversation. Adding value is good when on topic and in moderation. Positive and negative content are legitimate parts of any conversation. It\u2019s OK to accept the good and bad, but not the ugly.          BE MINDFUL OF RELATIONSHIPS          Think through creating friend/fan/follower connections where authority relationships exist. Many times you cannot control someone sharing your content or adding you to their connections, thereby gaining access to your content.          For Those Representing NYU Entities          BE CLEAR          When acting as a representative of the NYU community, clearly identify you or your group\u2019s relationship to NYU and link back to the appropriate NYU.edu web page to reinforce the connection to NYU. If you are a member of the NYU community, but acting in social media as an individual, make it clear that you are expressing your own opinion and not that of the University.          BE PREPARED          When creating or managing a social media account for an NYU entity, ensure access credentials are shared by at least two people in case one team member is unreachable or no longer at the University.          BE \u201cNYU\u201d          Remember you represent NYU; read the NYU Style Guidelines when creating profile/avatar images, graphics, or written content. Speak in accordance with your role at the University. If you have questions, contact the NYU Public Affairs social media team at social.media@nyu.edu .          BE SUCCESSFUL          Create a social media strategy: identify your audience, account\u2019s personality, goals, staffing, content calendar, and other tools for success before jumping in. Take advantage of University resources that can help you succeed.

Whether you're looking to enhance your existing social media strategy or just getting started with a new account, you've come to the right place. As social media usage continues to flourish here and in higher education as a whole, it's important that we take these efforts seriously.   This page is designed to help you, as the community manager or administrator of an NYU-focused account, to get started and to answer any questions that you may have regarding social media for University departments and organizations. The information provided is designed to enhance your social media strategy and help you meet your goals and benchmarks.              Social Media Best Practices          At NYU, we believe the use of social media is a way to digitally connect and communicate with others -- friends, classmates, colleagues, and sometimes strangers. The strength of social media is that it is built upon real relationships between people, with technology enabling people to easily connect with others around the world -- carrying messages quickly to others near and far.    Additionally, social networking (both on NYU-provided services and on commercially-available services) can help to support the University mission of teaching, learning, research, and community life.          Learn more about best practicies              Social Media Ambassadors          The Social Media Ambassadors is a group intended for employees who take part in managing social media on behalf of an NYU entity (i.e. office, department, school, etc.). The group is designed to facilitate community amongst the members increasing knowledge, awareness, and best practices in the areas of social media at NYU.    The group meets twice a semester for in-person meetings and communicates throughout the year using the Social Media Ambassadors Google Group.    Members should be active managers and administrators of a NYU social media account. An NYU.edu account is required to join. If you have any issues, please contact Chris Barrows at Chris.Barrows@nyu.edu .            Learn more about Social Media Ambassadors              Social Media Training Sessions          Training sessions are offered throughout the year through Human Resources iLearn system, the Social Media Ambassadors group and through personalized workshops set-up through the Digital Communications Group.   To inquire about social media training opportunities, you can inquire at social.media@nyu.edu .              Social Media Account Audits        If you manage an account for the university and would like to see improved results, we're here to help. Email Chris.Barrows@nyu.edu and request a social media account audit. In return, you'll get a one-page (per account) with tips and suggestions for improving your social media account. In addition, a follow-up conversation will take place to discuss the suggestions.    Audits are designed to provide guidance though all solutions may not be possible at the time of audit.              How Can We Help?        The New York University Social Media team offers a variety of resources and services.

Admit when you make mistakes and correct inaccurate information. Consider that you are in an academic environment and the implications of utilizing a NYU-provided platform that automatically identifies you in your role at NYU.          BE SMART          Social media is \u201creal life.\u201d Behavior in social media is no different than in e-mail, public speech, classroom lecture, conversation with friends, or a poster on a wall. Anything considered inappropriate offline is likely also inappropriate online. When in doubt about whether to share or not, it\u2019s better to be safe than sorry.          BE THOUGHTFUL          Be mindful of what is considered appropriate behavior in different countries and cultures around the world and of how your words, actions, and images may be perceived. Know your audience and think before you post.          BE RESPECTFUL          Social media provides a place to foster community and conversation. Adding value is good when on topic and in moderation. Positive and negative content are legitimate parts of any conversation. It\u2019s OK to accept the good and bad, but not the ugly.          BE MINDFUL OF RELATIONSHIPS          Think through creating friend/fan/follower connections where authority relationships exist. Many times you cannot control someone sharing your content or adding you to their connections, thereby gaining access to your content.          For Those Representing NYU Entities          BE CLEAR          When acting as a representative of the NYU community, clearly identify you or your group\u2019s relationship to NYU and link back to the appropriate NYU.edu web page to reinforce the connection to NYU. If you are a member of the NYU community, but acting in social media as an individual, make it clear that you are expressing your own opinion and not that of the University.          BE PREPARED          When creating or managing a social media account for an NYU entity, ensure access credentials are shared by at least two people in case one team member is unreachable or no longer at the University.          BE \u201cNYU\u201d          Remember you represent NYU; read the NYU Style Guidelines when creating profile/avatar images, graphics, or written content. Speak in accordance with your role at the University. If you have questions, contact the NYU Public Affairs social media team at social.media@nyu.edu .          BE SUCCESSFUL          Create a social media strategy: identify your audience, account\u2019s personality, goals, staffing, content calendar, and other tools for success before jumping in. Take advantage of University resources that can help you succeed.
