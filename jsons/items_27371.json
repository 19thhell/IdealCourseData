Awards for fellowships and research assistantships are made on a semi-monthly basis.    Students who teach receive compensation as a part-time adjunct instructor. These payments are made separately from fellowships and research assistantships. The disbursement schedule also provides semi-monthly payments, but on a slightly different schedule than fellowships and assistantships.    Please refer to the following sections:       Disbursement Schedule for the 2014-15 Academic Year    How to Obtain Funds    Direct Deposit    Tax Questions    Where to Go with Questions          1. Disbursement Schedule for the 2014-15 Academic Year    There are nine (9) disbursement dates for the fall semester, nine (9) disbursement dates for the spring semester, and six (6) disbursement dates for the summer.                     Fellowships and Research Assistantships    Part-time Adjunct Instructors          Fall 2014 (9 disbursements)          8/29    --          9/15    9/15          10/1    10/1          10/15    10/15          10/31    10/31          11/14    11/14          12/1    12/1          12/15    12/15          1/2/15    1/2/15          --    1/15          Spring 2015 (9 disbursements)          1/15    --          1/30    1/30          2/13    2/13          2/27    2/27          3/13    3/13          4/1    4/1          4/15    4/15          5/1    5/1          5/15    5/15          --    6/1          Summer 2015 (6 disbursements)          6/1    --          6/15    6/15          7/1    7/1          7/15    7/15          7/31    7/31          8/14    8/14          --    9/1                     The full fellowship or research assistantship award will be divided evenly over the disbursement schedule. For example, if you are receiving a $25,686 award for the academic year, then each check over the course of the 18 payment periods in the fall and spring will be in the amount of $1,427 (gross).      Similarly, compensation to a part-time adjunct instructor will be divided evenly over the disbursement schedule. For example, if you receive a $6,541 payment for the fall semester, then each check over the course of the 9 payment periods in the fall will be in the amount of $726.77 (gross).    2. How to Obtain Your Funds      You should arrange to obtain your funds through direct deposit (see the following section). Until you do, you will obtain your funds by check. Checks are usually delivered to your home department. Please see your department administrator.       Fellowship awards in combination with research assistantship: If you are receiving both types of awards, they are combined into one direct deposit or check.       Fellowship awards in combination with part-time adjunct instructor compensation: If you are receiving a fellowship at the same time you are teaching, you will receive two separate checks or direct deposits, one for the fellowship and the other for teaching. IMPORTANT NOTE:    You must be a registered student for the semester in order for your fellowship to be disbursed. If you have not registered for the semester at least 10 days prior to the date of disbursement, then your award may be held.    3. Direct Deposit      The Direct Deposit Program is available to students receiving fellowships or research assistantships, as well as compensation as part-time adjunct instructors.      If you were on direct deposit in the 2013-14 academic year for either a fellowship, research assistantship, or adjunct appointment, you will continue to be on direct deposit in 2014-15. You do not need to do anything further (unless you have changed banks; if so, you will need to update your record). This is true even if your type of support has changed this year. If you are not already on direct deposit, we ask that you take advantage of this service as soon as you receive your first stipend check. Once direct deposit is established (it may take 2 or more weeks), you will have access to your funds faster than by check.      To be eligible for direct deposit, you must have a checking or savings account at a bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s Automatic Clearinghouse (most U.S. banks and credit unions are members).    Whenever you change banks or switch accounts, you must change your direct deposit election. If you fail to do so, your payment will be misdirected and delayed. Signing up for direct deposit (or changing your bank information for a previous direct deposit election):  Sign in to your NYU home page at home.nyu.edu , and go to the \"Academics\" tab. Go to the section labeled \"PeopleSync: Manage your HR, Payroll and Stipend Information.\" Click on the \"PeopleSync Login\" button. Click on the \"Menu\" button in the upper-left hand corner (to the left of \"search\" ) and then click on \"All About Me.\" Go to the \"Actions\" section and click on \"Payment Elections.\" You will be able to change your current election there. The options are either check or direct deposit. Please be sure to add your bank account information before you click on the button to \"change elections.\"    4. Tax Questions       Fellowship stipends: If you are a U.S. citizen, please read the memo titled \"Tax Status of Scholarship and Fellowship Awards\" available at gsas.nyu.edu/object/grad.pdf.taxquestions . You may also find Internal Revenue Service Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education , helpful. It can be found online at http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf .       Research assistantships: Assistantships are subject to federal, state and local taxes.       Part-time adjunct instructors: Compensation for part-time adjunct instructors is subject to federal, state and local taxes.      The Graduate School is unable to provide tax advice and questions must be directed to a qualified personal tax advisor.       International students:       Maintain and update, as required, your record in the GLACIER Online Tax Compliance System to insure that taxes are withheld at appropriate rates. New fellowship students will receive an email from GLACIER in early August and should respond to it immediately. Continuing students must update their GLACIER record if they switch between fellowship, assistantship or adjunct appointments.    Tax-related questions about tax deductions and eligibility for tax treaty exemption on fellowship stipends, research assistantships and compensation for adjunct instructors should be directed to Raffaele Carollo, Tax Compliance Analyst at the Tax Department. The contact information is rsc6@nyu.edu , or (212) 998-2872.    NYU\u2019s Office of Global Services (OGS) provides a good overview of tax filing obligations for international students. The web page is   http://www.nyu.edu/global/international-immigration-services/students/inbound-to-nyc/active/taxes.html       5. Where to Go with Questions      The first place to go with questions is your department or program . Your department\u2019s administrator can tell you about disbursement, when the first check will be available (if different from the dates described above), and can help resolve problems such as investigating why the amount of a check is different from what you expected.      If your department cannot answer your question about your fellowship stipend award, then advisors in Graduate Enrollment Services can help you. You can email gsas.admissions@nyu.edu , or you can stop by the office at One-half Fifth Avenue.      If your department cannot answer your question about your research assistantship , or your appointment as a part-time adjunct instructor , then the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) Fiscal Services Office can help. The best way to reach them is by calling (212) 998-8011, or by emailing fas.payroll@nyu.edu .      If your department cannot answer your question about a missing check, or you have questions about direct deposit or tax withholding, then the University Payroll Office can help. The best way to reach them is by email at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu .
