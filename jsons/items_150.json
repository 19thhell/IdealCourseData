Bringing the Ethnic Studies debate in Tucson, AZ into your high school    Why can\u2019t they (Mexican American students in Tucson, AZ) learn about their history when we (Afro-Caribbean, Latino Caribbean and Afro American students) have to learn their (White, European) history all the time?      Students in my Global History course in Brownsville, Brooklyn, NY have raised this question every time I teach this unit. It also raises questions about what gets taught and why, who makes curricular decisions and the effect these decisions have on students\u2019 high school graduation and college matriculation rates. Some students stand steadfast in their belief that a students\u2019 interest in school has nothing to do with what is taught. Others argue strongly for the right to learn a \u2018different kind\u2019 of history and convey anger and annoyance for what has been taught to them previously. And still others fall somewhere along the spectrum, aware of the importance of and anxious about exams that other people create for their immediate and long term future; but also yearning for school to reflect \u2018their\u2019 history - whatever that might mean to them.      This unit is built around the film Precious Knowledge , a striking personal and political portrayal of the debate over the ethnic studies program in Tucson, AZ; sometimes called Hispanic Studies, or Mexican American Studies (MAS). As of Fall 2012, the MAS program has been dismantled, books have been banned, and teachers reassigned or let go, all due to the passage of Senate Bill 2281, Attorney General Tom Horne\u2019s declaration that the ethnic studies program illegal, and the Tucson Unified School District\u2019s vote to \u201ccease all Mexican American (but not other) ethnic studies classes for fear of losing state aid.\u201d      Through the course of this unit, students will think critically and write about curriculum they have experienced, learn about the curriculum offered in Tucson, AZ, and learn the skills of counterargument before debating and writing an opinion piece on the subject. Students will consider the following guiding questions: What gets taught in high school history classrooms and why? Why does it matter what you learn in high school? What is valued by the state exams? What is not? What should you learn in high school?     Ariela Rothstein created this curriculum as part of the CLACS 2012 Teacher Residency Program.

She teaches Middle East Studies and Latin American and Caribbean Studies courses as part of the global history curriculum for the school. The courses focus on critical thinking and writing skills, on themes and topics that are culturally relevant, engaging and focused on students becoming active readers, writers and citizens in our world today. Her curriculum is inspired by the work of the Coalition of Essential Schools, Teaching for Change, the Right Question Institute and the New York Collective of Radical Educators.
