Her research and teaching interests focus on Irish literature and culture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, with an approach often informed by religious and political history, as well as transnational, postcolonial, and cultural studies.

Professor Bender has been an invited speaker at The Columbia University Irish Studies Seminar, The James Joyce Summer School in Dublin, The New York Public Library, and the inaugural Memorial Lecture for Professor Barbara Gluck at the Baruch College Jewish Studies Center, CUNY.

I arrived in Irish Studies via Modernism, the Bible, and Jewish Studies, and I continue to focus on expressions of transcultural and transnational sympathy and connection. I love how the students and faculty at Glucksman Ireland House are similarly expanding the scope of Irish Studies as a field, through work that is interdisciplinary, cross-cultural, and dynamic.      \"I have prized the opportunity to mentor both undergraduates and graduate students on exciting research projects, and many of these projects have found audiences beyond our coursework, at conferences and as expanded M.A. theses, for example. Working individually with students to help them develop their original ideas is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of my job, and at GIH it\u2019s a mode that\u2019s fostered by the intimacy and intensity of seminar-style classes that typically meet in the wonderful space of the house itself.\"   Selected Works:   Israelites in Erin: Exodus, Revolution, and the Irish Revival (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press, 2015). \u201cThe Bloomsday Seder: Joyce and Jewish Memory,\u201d in Memory Ireland Volume 4: Joyce and Cultural Memory , eds.
