While abroad at NYU in Ghana, Lindsey took a course called Documenting the African City, through which she and her group created a 15-minute documentary film on the topic of identity politics. They interviewed and filmed African Americans living in Ghana, Ghanaian professors and university students, and other local residents. Lindsey says, \u201cHaving the opportunity to document the ideas and perspectives of so many individuals was truly an eye-opening experience.\u201d      Since graduating, Lindsey returned to her hometown of New Orleans, where she became the archive and library assistant at the Amistad Research Center. Housed at Tulane University, it is the nation\u2019s largest independent archives of manuscripts, photographs, oral histories, books, periodicals, and works of art about the history of African Americans and other ethnic groups. Currently, Lindsey is the program coordinator at the Neighborhood Story Project, a nonprofit organization in partnership with the University of New Orleans. She works with writers to create documentary books about their communities using oral histories and photography. Lindsey says, \u201cWhat I experienced in Ghana has influenced my professional decisions. Traveling and exploring in an unfamiliar place removed me from my comfort zone and therefore changed me. Learning about other people\u2019s cultures is now my comfort zone.\u201d                                                      NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

While abroad at NYU in Ghana, Lindsey took a course called Documenting the African City, through which she and her group created a 15-minute documentary film on the topic of identity politics. They interviewed and filmed African Americans living in Ghana, Ghanaian professors and university students, and other local residents. Lindsey says, \u201cHaving the opportunity to document the ideas and perspectives of so many individuals was truly an eye-opening experience.\u201d      Since graduating, Lindsey returned to her hometown of New Orleans, where she became the archive and library assistant at the Amistad Research Center. Housed at Tulane University, it is the nation\u2019s largest independent archives of manuscripts, photographs, oral histories, books, periodicals, and works of art about the history of African Americans and other ethnic groups. Currently, Lindsey is the program coordinator at the Neighborhood Story Project, a nonprofit organization in partnership with the University of New Orleans. She works with writers to create documentary books about their communities using oral histories and photography. Lindsey says, \u201cWhat I experienced in Ghana has influenced my professional decisions. Traveling and exploring in an unfamiliar place removed me from my comfort zone and therefore changed me. Learning about other people\u2019s cultures is now my comfort zone.\u201d                                                      NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.
