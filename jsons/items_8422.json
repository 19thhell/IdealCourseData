EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

In an almost emblematic way, this position and function seems to be embodied in our image of the far-distant caravan trader, traversing on the so-called \u201cSilk roads\u201d the vast expanses between China and the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. However, it was not only traders that connected the civilizations of the ancient world via Central Asia: with and next to the traders\u2019 caravans traveled diplomats, missionaries, artists and many more; and vast parts of Eurasia were, again and again, connected and controlled by confederations and empires of nomadic origin. We inquire into the many facets, which characterize the resulting network, oscillating around Central Asia, from the Bronze Age onwards up to the days of the Mongol Empire, taking a multi-disciplinary approach to a considerable variety of primary evidence, ranging from ancient travel reports and business letters to spectacular archaeological artifacts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus Major social, cultural, and political transformation of the Middle East from late antiquity through the mid-thirteenth century, considered in the context of the formation and evolution of Islamic culture and polity. Examines the emergence of key concepts, practices, and cultural motifs of the medieval Islamic tradition. Also examines the emergence of the idea/concept of the \"Middle East\", the history and background of European interest in the region, as well as the crucial role of cultural encounter and dialogue (e.g., through trade, colonization, polemics) in the formation and development of identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 503, Cultures &amp; Contexts: South Asia Prof. Rajagopal (Media, Culture, &amp; Communication)  syllabus The South Asian subcontinent is in many ways at the heart of contemporary globalization. Few regions contain a higher density of population experiencing faster rates of social change. South Asia is the site of massive social transformations, ranging from new modes of consumption and aspiration, to accelerated urbanization, rising social inequality, and violent inter- and intra-state conflict. A little analyzed, yet central catalyst for these transformations is represented by media industries, which have grown at a rate greater than that of the economy as a whole for several years now. The current centrality of media to social life as neither entirely new, nor unprecedented, and provides entry points--from print and visual culture, to cinema, television, internet (including social media such as Youtube), and cellphones--for understanding both media history and South Asia, the relationship between culture and technology, the South Asian diaspora, mediated religion, and a range of inter-related topics. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 510, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Russia Prof. Kotsonis (History)  syllabus Focuses on distinctive historical and geographical dichotomies and issues in Russian culture. Emphasis is on primary documents, including literary works, travel notes, works of art, and political statements from all periods, chosen to establish the particular matrix of competing positions that make up the Russian national and cultural identity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 512, Cultures &amp; Contexts: China Prof. Zhang (East Asian Studies)  syllabus  An introduction to the main issues and foundational texts of imperial and modern China. Selected readings include excerpts from early Chinese classics such as Classic of Odes and the Analects to the vernacular novels of late imperial China. The classical canon is then coupled with central texts from modern China, from the initial reflections of the mandarin scholars on a rapidly changing world, to writings on revolution, the modern state, and the new culture of the enlightened individual by leading Chinese intellectuals in the 20th century. Rather than a display of cultural and literary edifices, our intellectual and critical interest is to rethink Chinese traditions, both imperial and modern, in terms of continuity as well as discontinuity. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Fleming (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The people of the Hebrew Bible understood themselves to be united as an ancient tribe called Israel, a name that lay behind even the eventual state. Working backward from the fullest early definition of Israel, when the Hebrew Bible was taking final form, toward the time of older origins, we push back in time, using the Bible as the primary point of reference, while examining various independent evidence. Writing projects focus mainly on interpretation of biblical texts. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 515, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Latin America Prof. Lane (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 529, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures Prof. Beltr\u00e1n (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus  Explores the political, social, and cultural practices of Latinos in the   United States using a historical and interdisciplinary approach. Draws   on literature, history, politics, as well as social and political   theory to address issues of participation, under-representation, and   civic and economic empowerment. Topics include immigration, social   movements, figures of resistance, identities, popular culture, and   language. Of particular concern is the idea and representation of a   pan-ethnic \u201cLatino\u201d identity encompassing all the diverse national   groups, and the emergence of this concept in both the cultural and   political life of these communities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 532, Cultures &amp; Contexts: African Diaspora Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  The dispersal of Africans to various parts of the world and over time, examining their experiences and those of their descendants. Regions of special interest include the Americas and the Islamic world, centering on questions of slavery and freedom while emphasizing the emergence of cultural forms and their relationship to both African and to non-African influences. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 536, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Indigenous Australia Prof. Myers (Anthropology)  syllabus  The indigenous people of Australia have long been the subject of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics, and they have entered into representations as distinctively \"Other\"\u2014whether in negative or positive formulations of the \"Primitive.\" These representations\u2014in feature films about them such as Walkabout and Rabbit Proof Fence, in New Age Literature, or museum exhibitions\u2014are now also in dialogue with their own forms of cultural production. At the same time, Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions in their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. We explore the historical and geographical range of Aboriginal Australian forms of social being through ethnographic texts, art, novels, autobiographies, film and other media, and consider the ways in which identity is being challenged and constructed. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 539, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures Prof. Saranillio (Social &amp; Cultural Analysis)  syllabus Examines significant historical and contemporary moments through an analysis of culture and power and how cultural productions--film, television dramas, novels, visual art, national monuments and memorials, among others--produce ideas, stories and silences in different historical moments about different Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders that have contemporary resonance today. For instance, how is it that the bikini, which most people associate with suggestive beach wear, has its origins in the U.S. nuclear testing of the first hydrogen bomb on the Bikini Atoll that irradiated much of the Pacific? How do historical representations of Asian American men make the meteoric rise of basketball star Jeremy Lin so unexpected and anomalous? How do histories of U.S. wars in Asia coupled with anti-Asian immigrant legislation shape ideas about Asian Americans as \u201cperpetual foreigners\u201d even centuries after Asian migration to the United States? Using different methods of cultural inquiry such as visual and popular culture, sports and media studies, literary critique, political economy and legal studies, we examine the complex ways that ideas about race, gender, sexuality, and indigeneity produce unequal power relations in U.S. society. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 540, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Mongol Asia and Its Legacy Prof. Ben-Dor Benite (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies/History)  syllabus The Mongol Empire was one of the greatest empires in world history, covering virtually all of Eurasia from the Pacific Ocean to the outskirts of Central Europe. Its impact went far beyond its physical boundaries and lasted well after it disappeared. We examine the history of that nomadic empire from a world history perspective emphasizing the way in which it shaped major cultures and civilizations all over Asia, Europe, and north Africa. Themes include nomadic life and culture, the structure of a nomadic empire, how that nomadic empire interacted with the various settled states it conquered, and ramifications of the Mongol conquest on economy and trade, medicine, science and technology, food and art, culture and religion, as well as social and intellectual developments across Eurasia, during the time period from approximately 1200 to 1450 C.E. Our primary sources will be narratives of Mongols generals, stories of peoples they conquered, and travelogues of people who travelled in Mongol territories, and we also look at visual depictions of the Mongols in art and cinema, pay special attention to the environment and how it shaped the life of the Mongols, dedicate time to the image of Genghis Khan, the role played by women, both from the commoner society and from the elite, and interactions with Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, and Islam. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 544, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain Prof. Abercrombie (Anthropology)  syllabus  Spanish modernity, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic: Spain has not been a major world power in over 200 years, during which its competitors and successor empires (France, Britain, and the U.S.) branded it, via a conglomeration of ideas called the \u201cBlack Legend,\u201d as a backwards and feudal bastion of superstition and intolerance, good only for anthropologists and tourists. A hotbed of state-building in antiquity, Spain emerged as a center of Renaissance learning under Arab and Berber rule. While the rest of Europe languished in feudalism, its seven centuries co-existence of Christians, Muslims, and Jews saw the rebirth of classical knowledge, the spread of literacy, the development of a human-centered cosmology, the emergence of narrative self-making and the novel, and Europe\u2019s first primarily urban society, where philosophy, the sciences, architecture, and the arts flourished. After Christian princes defeated the last Islamic foothold in the Peninsula in 1492, Castilian language and culture was the backbone of Spain\u2019s imperial expansion across the Atlantic and produced the first modern, disciplining state, the privileging of individualism, private property, and capitalism, and theses of popular sovereignty, the nation state, and theories of racial inequality. Outpaced in industrialization by the late 18th-century, still Spain (and the new nations of Spanish America) kept pace with liberal reforms that culminated in the clash of competing fascist-capitalist and democratic-socialist ideologies, leading to the Spanish Civil War, World War II, the Cold War, and the re-birth of Spanish democracy in the post-Franco and European Union era, and Spain\u2019s current avant-garde role in culture and the arts. Materials include history, ethnography, literature, and film. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 552, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Empires and the Political Imagination Prof. Burbank (History) and Prof. Cooper (History)  syllabus  Comparative study of empires, from the Romans to the present, and the ways that empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a state that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Empires--polities that maintained social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people--have been one of the most common and durable forms of political organization. An examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of how people lived in empires--sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. We investigate how empires were held together--and where they were weak--from perspectives that focus on political and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. We also explore how scholars have approached the topic of empires, examining their methods and their interpretations. Readings include historical scholarship on the Roman, Chinese, Mongol, Spanish, Russian, French, British, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities. FALL 2014 CORE-UA 555, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Brazil Prof. Weinstein (History)  syllabus Brazil's transformation from a colonial, agrarian, slave society to a predominantly urban, industrialized nation, and an aspiring world power. Considers how Brazil became both a major industrial power and a society with all the classic social ills of a \u201cGlobal South\u201d nation. We also explore the relationship between mainstream notions of modernity and development, and the many different social and cultural initiatives that have produced Brazil\u2019s hybrid popular culture and multiple national identities. Topics include slavery, racism, and emancipation, urban life, immigration and industrialization, changing gender roles, carnaval and popular culture, and democratization.  Spring 2015 SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 502, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Islamic Societies Prof. Rowson (Middle Eastern &amp; Islamic Studies)  syllabus  The Islamic world from about the year 600 to about 1300. Despite very large variations in culture across time and space, it is meaningful to speak of a single Islamic civilization during this period, and we ask why. Although the dominance of the religion of Islam, in one way or another, serves to define and unify the societies under examination, and religion will be a major topic of study, attention is also paid to philosophy and science, literature and music, and art and architecture. Reading are English translations of Arabic works written by the inhabitants of this world themselves. A chief objective is to help students appreciate just how different a culture different from their own--and especially one in the distant past--can be, and yet make perfect sense to its participants. By reading, analyzing, and discussing what those participants have to say about a myriad of topics, students gain insights into how cultures in general, including their own, work; and although the modern world is not included, study of the Islamic past will also enhance students\u2019 understanding of Islam and Islamic cultures today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 505, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Africa Prof. Gomez (History)  syllabus  Major issues and questions relating to Africa's development from early to contemporary times, approached through its literature. While not a formal study of the history of Africa, establishes the historical context for understanding the literary texts in the periods in which they are embedded. Examined regionally and over time are questions concerning the relationship of the production of literature to centers of power, the meaning of literature in societies espousing orality, the problematics of sustaining both content and intent upon the conversion of oral literature into written form, the specific and at times parochial uses of literature, the interplay of gender and voice, and the politics of translation into European modalities. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 507, Cultures and Contexts: Japan Prof. Kaffen (East Asian Studies)  syllabus Japan from 1945 to the present, through cinema, animation, photography, manga, television, kami shibai, pop songs, and other creative forms of expression and documentation, with emphasis on various points of view both within Japan (women, youth, burakumin, Okinawan), and externally (the US-Japan relationship, Japan\u2019s relationship with its East- Asian neighbors). We consider the ways Japan is framed and imagined, as well as the tensions, contradictions, and variety of perspectives at work in those imaginations; the processes of mediation through which history and place are constructed; and issues such as war responsibility, high economic growth, political radicalism, technology and consumption, and \u201clost decades,\u201d and what they might mean for a consideration of Japan\u2019s place in the world at present. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 509, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Caribbean Prof. Khan (Anthropology)  syllabus  Examines the impact of the Caribbean's long colonial history from the perspective of its diverse populations, through race, class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Known for its beauty, cultural vitality, and mix of peoples, cultures, and languages, the Caribbean is where today's global economy began, some 500 years ago. Its sugar economy and history of slave labor and colonialism made it the site of massive transplantations of peoples and cultures from Africa for more than four centuries and from Asia since the mid-19th century, and of a sizable influx of peoples from Europe all along. Readings examine the history of the region's differing forms of colonialism; the present postcolonial economic and political structures; anthropological material on family and community life, religious beliefs and practices, gender roles and ideologies; and ways in which national, community, and group identities are expressed today. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 514, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Ancient Israel Prof. Jassen (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus The culture of the ancient Israelite societies of biblical times, covering the period from about 1200 B.C.E. to the conquests of Alexander the Great, in the fourth century B.C.E. Topics include the achievements of these societies in the areas of law and social organization, prophetic movements, Israelite religion, and ancient Hebrew literature. The Hebrew Bible preserves much of the creativity of the ancient Israelites, but archaeological excavations in Israel and neighboring lands, as well as the discovery of ancient writings in Hebrew and related languages, have added greatly to our knowledge of life as it was lived in biblical times. The civilizations of Egypt and Syria-Mesopotamia also shed light on Israelite culture. Of particular interest is the early development of Israelite monotheism, which, in time, emerged as ancient Judaism, the mother religion of Christianity and Islam. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 516, Cultures &amp; Contexts: India Prof. Ganti (Anthropology)  syllabus  Utilizing a variety of sources\u2014novels, films, and academic scholarship\u2014students are introduced to the history, culture, society, and politics of modern India. Home to one billion people, eight major religions, twenty official languages (with hundreds of dialects), histories spanning several millenia, and a tremendous variety of customs, traditions, and ways of life, India is almost iconic for its diversity. We examine the challenges posed by such diversity as well as how this diversity has been understood, represented, and managed, both historically and contemporarily. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 537, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Modern Israel Prof. Zweig (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Modern Israel\u2014Society and Culture: Despite its small size and population, Israel is a diverse, dynamic, and complex society. To understand its ethnic, religious, and political divisions, the different ethnic origins of the Jewish population over the last 150 years will be examined, and the growing role of the Arab population (approaching 20%) in Israeli society will be discussed. The special role of religion in the secular state, the development of Hebrew speaking culture, the political system, the settlement movement and the peace movement, gender issues, and the role of the army in everyday life are all addressed, concluding with a survey of the debate on whether Israel is a Jewish state or a state of all its citizens. Although the controversial issues that keep Israel in the headlines are touched on, the focus is the character of Israeli society and the impact on everyday life of living in the international limelight. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 541, Cultures &amp; Contexts: New World Encounters Prof. Tortorici (Spanish &amp; Portuguese)  syllabus  What was America before it was called \u201cAmerica\u201d? How did indigenous peoples understand and document their first encounters with Europeans and Africans? We focus on how the convergence of indigenous, African, European, and Asian peoples in the Americas created complex cultures, societies, ethnicities, and forms of religiosity. Beginning with the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the \u201cIndies\u201d by Christopher Columbus in 1492, we work our way thematically and chronologically through the centuries of conquest and colonial rule, up until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century. We also examine the historical context before 1492 in the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East (with an emphasis on how particular Old World encounters affected New World encounters). SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 545, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Egypt of the Pharaohs Prof. Roth (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus  Ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period, 1550-1069 BCE. During this period of imperial conquest, the ancient Egyptian civilization, already more than sixteen centuries old, increasingly interacted with the peoples and civilizations beyond its borders. We examine the remains of this newly cosmopolitan pharaonic culture, including a variety of primary sources\u2014texts (literature, popular stories, religious writings, letters, and administrative documents), as well as material culture (works of art, architecture, archaeological remains). Students learn how scholars analyze this material to reconstruct New Kingdom cultural life and use these methods themselves to gain insight into the Egyptians' religious beliefs, social forms and organizations, and conventions and achievements of their literature, art, and architecture, as well as to critically evaluate the interpretations and reconstructions in the secondary scholarship. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 549, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Ortolano (History)  syllabus Introduces students to the peoples, cultures, and histories of the British Isles. Today home to a pair of European states, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, this grouping of islands off the northwestern coast of Europe has historically been home to an astonishing variety of peoples, kingdoms, religions, nations, and states. Rather than collapsing this diversity into a study of the English people or the British state, we think about the United Kingdom as a multinational formation, produced through the experience of repeated invasions, encounters, and migrations. Our ultimate goals are twofold: to learn about the peoples of the British Isles, and to use this knowledge to think critically about claims regarding national characteristics, ethnic stability, or cultural homogeneity--in Britain, and beyond. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 553, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Pagan Europe, 60\u20131600 C.E. Prof. Bedos-Rezak (History)  syllabus  In pre-modern Europe, where a Christian outlook prevailed, the existence of pre-Christian cultures drove a master narrative that all but cast them off as the heterodox mythology and magic of primitive religions. We examine both the medieval evidence for the nature of European pagan cultures and the tendency of modern scholarship to endorse the medieval self-proclaimed image of a monolithic Christian occident. The medieval discourse on paganism cannot be reduced to its condemnation and rejection; this would ignore the ways that the predominant culture had in fact integrated elements of paganism into its theology, philosophy, rituals, calendar, life-cycle events, scientific knowledge, intellectual categories, literary creations, artistic repertoire, and physical environment. As we consider a millennium of European civilization (60 c.e.-1600 c.e.) from the perspective of paganism, we cross-pollinate multiple streams of evidence (textual, archeological, artifactual) with various epistemologies (history, anthropology, folklore, literary criticism), which will allow a new chronology and a new geography to emerge. SPRING 2015 CORE-UA 554, Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Merjian (Italian)  syllabus  The culture of modern Italy\u2014a nation younger than the United States, yet steeped in all manner of millennial traditions, linguistic dialects, and regional artistic and economic customs. \u201cWe have made Italy; we must now make Italians.\u201d Thus declared the politician and writer Massimo d\u2019Azeglio following the country\u2019s belated unification in 1861. How has Italy attempted to \u201cmake Italians\u201d over the last century? What forms of culture could unify a people so diverse in origins and aspirations? Has the country managed to transform itself from a \u201cgeographic idea\u201d to a cultural reality? Aside from commonplaces\u2014rolling hills, historical landmarks, beloved cuisine, fashion runways\u2014what are the bel paese\u2019s most salient cultural characteristics, and why do they matter? We examine cultural manifestations in various visual, verbal, and material forms: manifestos, cinema, literature, popular music, poetry, architecture, painting, television, exhibitions, and journalism.
