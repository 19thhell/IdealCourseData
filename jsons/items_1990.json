The city of Florence will be the classroom as students study the masters, explore museums, examine texts, and analyze the historical significance of monuments. With eyes cast simultaneously on painting, the graphic arts, sculpture, and architecture, this class will explore a broad range of art patronage that included religious and civic bodies, princely courts, and a growing number of private clients. The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making.

This course is conceived as a series of selected studies, offering in depth analysis of a few great masters of Early Renaissance Italian painting: Giotto, Masaccio, Fra Angelico, Benozzo Gozzoli and Ghirlandaio, Botticelli, Filippino Lippi, among others. These artists have been chosen for the unique opportunity afforded by study in Florence to examine their works in original contexts, especially the great fresco cycles they created with their workshops. The course is, however, neither limited to the study of these artists nor to the study of painting. Their works will be considered in relation to those of other contemporary masters active in the courts of Central and Northern Italy, including Andrea Mantegna, Piero della Francesca, Cosm\u00e9 Tura and Leonardo da Vinci. They will also be considered in rapport with other contemporary art forms, especially the sculpture of Ghiberti, Donatello and Verrocchio. In studying original works of art on site, context, function and materials will be considered equal in importance to matters of style. Special attention will be given to the phenomenon of collecting as an active force shaping the development of artistic forms and genres. The study of collecting will bring into consideration intellectual, social, economic and political issues that complicate and enrich our understanding of the work of the early masters of the Italian Renaissance.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

On both sides of the Atlantic, the concept of multiculturalism and the question of irregular migration present thorny issues for academics and policy makers alike. This course will provide a comparative (US/Europe) introduction to the history of migration, from the late 1880\u00b4s to the present day, in order to help students develop a basic historical framework that will allow them to more deeply understand contemporary migration policy and debates surrounding immigrant integration. The experiences of a number of European countries will be looked at in depth: the UK, France, Italy, and Germany. We will begin by looking at mass Italian migration to the US in the late 19th and early Twentieth Centuries, discussing how the first waves of Italian migrants were racialized and how they were inserted into the existing racial order in the US. We will learn about the Fascist Period in Italy, and in particular, its Racial Laws and the specificities of the Holocaust in Italy during World War II and how this period has influenced the way that continental European countries collect and organize census data. Moving into the contemporary period, we will explore how Italy has transformed itself from a historic emigrant-sending country into one of Europe\u00b4s leading immigrant-receiving nations and how it has managed migration to date; discuss the myths and reality of the hotly debated issue of undocumented migration; learn about how migration policy is always gendered and impacts differently upon men and women; gain insight into the highly stigmatized Roma communities in Europe, and study multiculturalism and citizenship policy in Europe and the US through a range of case studies, such as the Muslim headscarf debate. There will be a strong focus on &quot;on-site&quot; learning in this course, with field trips to a Sikh temple in the province of Tuscany, the Jewish museum in Florence, the Chinese quarter of Prato, as well as site visits to associations that work with immigrants and refugees.                                                                      The Italian South - HIST-UA 9538 - 4 points                               The course is a voyage through the fascinating and complex history and culture of the  Italian South, from the first half of the Nineteenth Century to the present day. Adopting  an interdisciplinary approach we will explore the rich patrimony of southern history, as  well as the violence of a society with neither rules nor justice.

Its aim is to offer the student a new pattern in the succession of tendencies, movements and mass cultures, with a broader perspective, spanning from 19th Century Post-Unification Italian culture to 1980s 'cult writers, cartoonists and literary groups from the 1990s and 2000s. The course will undertake not only a spatial journey abroad (to America, the Middle or Far East, Africa) or inland (especially the South), but also an intellectual, political and spiritual adventure: tracing a path between the Wars, the economic Boom, the Generation of \u201968 and \u201977, a psychedelic trip in New Age trends, and the so called Pulp Generation or Young Cannibals.

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

The first opens with an analysis of the intellectual foundations of the witch-hunt from late Antiquity to the early Renaissance. The second section concentrates on the most infamous handbook for witch-hunters, Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of the Witches\u201d) and on the roots of medieval misogyny. The third section looks at the mass witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the backdrop of the break between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and examines the connections linking witch-hunting to the momentous social, political and religious changes of the times. In the fourth part, the course will shift focus to the grassroots level, shedding light on the economic and social mechanisms which lead a community to \u201cmake a witch\u201d.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

By studying social networks -- i.e., the web of relationships in which individuals and groups are embedded --, we will understand important collective dynamics, such as interpersonal influence, social diffusion, the origin of social norms, group cohesion and inter-group conflict, political participation, and market exchange. This course will offer an overview of basic social networks concepts, combining the theoretical tradition of structural and relational sociology with the analytical tools of graph theory.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.
