Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.

We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.   Please visit our\u00a0 NewsDoc site for more information about the program      \u00a0   NewsDoc Alumni on Producing their First Films at NYU   &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;   \u00a0   New Master Classes   Not only do students work with full time faculty, but we now have a series of MASTER CLASSES that bring in the best independent documentary filmmakers in New York  City. We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

Documentary   News and Documentary prepares students to report and produce short form and long form journalism for traditional and non-traditional media. From the first class, students are on the streets reporting, shooting and editing. We emphasize not only the story, but the storytelling. Our goal is to have a student skilled in both form and content, able tell a story by effectively using all aspects of the medium.   The Reporting I class begins with the basics of short form stories in a variety of formats and genres. After a progression of reporting classes, the curriculum culminates with each student producing a thirty-minute documentary . Our News Magazine editing class coincides with the Advanced Reporting class to give extra support to the production of the documentary. News Doc students have the opportunity to take electives university wide.

We also host filmmaker screenings throughout the year so students can see current work and interact with filmmakers to learn more about the process and different styles.   Our students are in demand for internships at all the major  broadcast news organizations and websites in New York as well as at  smaller documentary production companies.   \u00a0   Our Specialness   NewsDoc is special because it is among the most creative programs in journalism education. Many journalism programs today use multimedia as a catch phrase: it has become short hand for scratching the surface of everything. The problem with that approach is that you master nothing.   NewsDoc still takes the long view. It values in-depth long form journalism and takes the time to get there. Its curriculum is made up of building blocks with each class and semester layering on what came before. The diverse backgrounds of the faculty \u2013 film documentary, broadcast news, TV news magazine, multimedia reporting, even magazine writing \u2013 is a testament to the program\u2019s respect for storytelling in all forms and exposes students to a variety of tools to draw from. That is how you truly master your craft and it is evident in the annual News Doc Film Festival. You leave us prepared to work in news at the networks, a documentary production company, VICE, New York Times video or on your own.   \u00a0   Fellow Students  NewsDoc also has a tradition of attracting students from all over the  world. This commitment to creating an intimate international group each year is the best newsroom setting we can imagine. Students partner on projects, share feedback, and foster a strong professional environment. Most incoming students have two-three years of professional and intern experience in some aspect of journalism but that is not a requirement. We\u2019re interested in interesting students who have something to say.  \u00a0     \u00a0   \u00a0   Rialda Zukic (2014) films her thesis documentary in Sarajevo, Bosnia.

The course begins with visual storytelling and then expands to different storytelling techniques for different kinds of topics, from traditional news reporting to the cinema verite style. By covering neighborhoods in New York, students learn to develop story ideas, conduct interviews and structure a story. Detailed script analysis is combined with in-depth discussions of student work. This course also includes viewing assignments based on understanding the historical development of the form. Students work in teams of two.   GRADUATE TV REPORTING II - G54.1172 Prerequisite : G54.1040 (required) This intermediate second semester course builds on the storytelling skills learned the first semester by doing a combination of magazine, short investigative and enterprise stories pieces as well as assignments aimed at preparing them for long form documentary work. Students also learn how to write a proposal and treatment for their half-hour documentary project.   GRADUATE ADVANCED TV REPORTING - G54.1175 Prerequisite : G54.1040 and G54.1172 (required) This class is unique to our news and documentary curriculum. The focus of the course is on developing an interesting in-depth story that will have a complex story structure and style. The emphasis is on understanding process, from research skills to the final edit of a documentary length story. Students work on advanced interviewing techniques and more complex methods of gathering audio and video, effective writing to pictures. The goal is that students understand how style can enhance the meaning of the story. Research and primary shooting occurs over the summer with the equipment support from the department.   The professor works closely with the students in and out of class with attention to every detail of the production process. This means the student learns how to pitch a story and present it during the various stages of production. This one on one contact is an essential part of the learning process and distinct to our program.   WRR I: NEWS &amp; DOCUMENTARY - G54.1021.009 The best journalism flows from logical thinking, solid research, and comprehensive journalism. Through short deadline pieces and longer writing assignments this class will simulate a newsroom and teach you how to think like a journalist. New York City will be your reporting lab and you will be sent out into the city hunting for stories from day one. While the primary focus of this class is print, the skills will give you a strong journalism foundation that can be used in any media.   PRESS ETHICS - G54.0012.002 This course offers through the case method a critical examination of current and recurring ethical and legal issues in journalism. Areas covered include reporting practices, roles of editors and executives, conflict of interest, sources, defamation and privacy, criminal justice and national security.   POLITICAL CINEMA - G54.1182.11 In contemporary war, \"the other\" is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but, often, as one to be eliminated. How do journalists and filmmakers fight against (or, alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? This class will focus primarily (though not exclusively) on one of the world's most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East--though it will also explore films from Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, and the United States. Through journalistic readings and film screenings, we will explore how \"the other\" is constructed: politically, aesthetically, ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in contemporary politics and history, especially those of the Mideast; the journalism of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them; filmmaking; and film criticism.   TV NEWSCAST: THE DIGITAL NEWSROOM- G54.1070 (Open to all graduate journalism students) Students learn broadcast writing skills in a real time situation by producing a live broadcast that goes out over the NYU cable to the dorms and public buildings. The emphasis of the class is on developing news judgment under tight deadline pressures. The students in the class perform all the editorial and technical roles on the newscast and report stories as well. We have national and international video footage from the CNN Pathfire news service and we have the AP ENPS news system that provides wires and software for formatting the newscast. Interview skills are developed during the newscast with in-depth newsmaker interviews. Positions are rotated to give students a sense of the different roles in a newsroom and the importance of teamwork.   LONG FORM VIDEO EDITING - GA1182.07 The class will explore the complexity of long form visualization and the various structural options possible through editing.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but the different ways of telling them.\u00a0 Through various exercises the students will experiment with various approaches and editing styles.\u00a0 Simultaneous with this class, students will be working on their own documentaries in Advanced TV Reporting.\u00a0 Whereas that class is more focused on concept and structure, the editing class will look closely at specific editing choices and techniques.   VISUAL THINKING- G54.1148 The class explores the complexity of documentary visualization through cinematography.\u00a0 It will examine not only how stories get told, but also how we might inspire new ways of telling them visually.\u00a0 This class will immerse the students in the challenges of different approaches and shooting styles through production exercises and through significant documentary examples.   The students' work has won many awards from the Academy of TV Arts and Science Student Awards, the Christopher Awards and American Women in Radio and Television and appeared in many prestigious film festivals. They have also received travel grants from the National Television Academy Foundation and the Student Academy Awards.
