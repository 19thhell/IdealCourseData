The Medieval and Renaissance Love Lyric   MEDI-UA 420 Offered periodically. 4 points.   The courtly love lyric, one of the most enduring genres of Western literature, portrayed love as an experience ranging from a degrading passion to an ennobling force, often crucial to poetic inspiration. The course traces the medieval love lyric from its beginnings in 11th-century Provencal through its developments in Latin, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Examines how the themes and conventions of this lyric are transformed in the Renaissance by such major love poets as Petrarch, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne. Medieval Misogyny MEDI-UA 488 4 points. Beginning with the biblical story of creation and moving through the powerful gendered tradition established by Saint Paul, this course will look at key texts of the Western Middle Ages (in modern English translation) in which men lay down the law, and occasionally, women talk back. Among other works we will take up the letters of Abelard and Heloise, the life of the enclosed Christina of Markyate, the fictive but larger than life Wife of Bath, and the imagined feminine utopia of Christine de Pizan.    Medieval Theatre   MEDI-UA 712 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Survey of medieval theatre in Europe: the plays and their contexts in the church, courts, and carnival.

Through the European literary tradition, students examine larger problems of the development of medieval literature: the conception of history, the rise of the romance genre, the themes of courtly love, the code of chivalry, and philosophical and theological questions as the Arthurian material is developed through the stories of the Holy Grail.

Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, performing a substantial piece of narrative poetry, singing or playing a body of medieval songs, or choosing a similar activity.
