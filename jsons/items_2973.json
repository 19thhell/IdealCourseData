Brian Ray  is a third-year doctoral student in American Studies who works in the transnational history of capitalism and social movements, queer studies, science studies, and transnational religion studies. He holds a BA in Women's Studies and Philosophy from the University of Georgia. His dissertation project is a transdisciplinary study of gay conservative activism and thought in the U.S. and Mexico. Tentatively, he conceives of gay conservatism as a post-WWII political \"third-way\" movement that poses interesting questions regarding left/right political identification, subjectivity, and the structure of history. Drawing on immanent critique and biopolitical frameworks, his project is in conversation with reconfigurations of Thomas Frank's infamous \"What's the matter with Kansas?\", like Bethany Moreton's reversal \"What matters to Arkansas?\" As such, his project explores how some counterintuitive or seemingly frustrated political identifications, like gay conservatives, are made possible by mapping the ethical substance of self-proclaimed post-partisan politics. Without psychologizing them, neither right nor left, what motivates these political actors? In this endeavor, particular attention is given to transnational material formations that have inaugurated and facilitated gay conservative movements in particular but that speak questions of subjectivity and progress in broader ways. A few include: narco trafficking, aesthetics, atheistic and theistic Satanisms, BDSM, contemporary science, the HIV/AIDS crisis, prosperity gospel, and the rise of neoliberalism in the Americas.  James Rodriguez entered NYU's American Studies PhD program in 2012 following his graduation from Brooklyn College, where he obtained a BA in both English and Psychology.

Most recently, he worked as a contributor to the Advertising Educational Foundation and The Smithsonian Institution's online exhibition, Race, Ethnicity, and Advertising in America 1890-1900.  Stuart Schrader is a sixth-year PhD candidate in American Studies. His dissertation is entitled \"American Streets, Foreign Territory: How Counterinsurgent Knowledge Militarized Policing and Criminalized Color,\" for which he was awarded the Mellon/American Council of Learned Societies Dissertation Completion Fellowship. The dissertation examines transformations in policing that occurred in response to 1960s political struggles in the United States. These transformations, often characterized as the War on Crime and the rise of the carceral state, relied, the dissertation argues, on transnational networks of social scientists and policing and counterinsurgency experts. He has published in American Quarterly, Social Text: Periscope, CITY: Analysis of Urban Trends, NACLA Report on the Americas, Brooklyn Rail, and Maximum Rocknroll.   Jackson Smith is a first-year doctoral student in American Studies. He is broadly concerned with how practices of dispossession shape urban futures. As an undergraduate he conducted original archival research on the squatters\u2019 movement on the gentrifying Lower East Side. This research culminated with his article in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory, as well as his participation from 2011 to 2014 with the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS), a storefront museum about squatting and community gardening in the East Village. He was the co-founder and curator of the MoRUS Film Fest in 2013 and 2014. Although continuing to research urban redevelopment by asking how international investment practices materially transform the city, Jackson has recently taken up dispossession as a socio-legal problem. He is devising a research project on civil asset forfeiture, a legal device that enables law enforcement to seize currency and other property outside of criminal proceedings. Civil forfeiture is premised upon the legal culpability of objects rather than people and effectively terminates the due process rights of the liberal subject. His research on the phenomenon will chart its legal formation during the 1970s and 1980s and ethnographically investigate its utilization to seize homes in contemporary Philadelphia.          Jennifer Flores Sternad \u2019s work as an academic, curator and writer focuses on militant art, performance, and artistic practices aligned with left social movements in the Americas.

Sam Markwell is a first-year PhD student with an MA in American Studies from the University of New Mexico. His work is situated in the fields of historical materialism, anthropology, geography, Native studies, settler colonial studies, and ethnic studies. His research investigates the array of concepts and apparatuses of \"security\" that animate U.S. and Israeli settler colonial projects, specifically focusing on contestations over food and water infrastructures. By critiquing the roles played by the U.S. and Israel in shaping life in these regions, he aims to reorient the study of security away from the priorities and frameworks of the settler nation-state to alternative political and ethical geographies of the Americas and West Asia.

Brian Ray  is a third-year doctoral student in American Studies who works in the transnational history of capitalism and social movements, queer studies, science studies, and transnational religion studies. He holds a BA in Women's Studies and Philosophy from the University of Georgia. His dissertation project is a transdisciplinary study of gay conservative activism and thought in the U.S. and Mexico. Tentatively, he conceives of gay conservatism as a post-WWII political \"third-way\" movement that poses interesting questions regarding left/right political identification, subjectivity, and the structure of history. Drawing on immanent critique and biopolitical frameworks, his project is in conversation with reconfigurations of Thomas Frank's infamous \"What's the matter with Kansas?\", like Bethany Moreton's reversal \"What matters to Arkansas?\" As such, his project explores how some counterintuitive or seemingly frustrated political identifications, like gay conservatives, are made possible by mapping the ethical substance of self-proclaimed post-partisan politics. Without psychologizing them, neither right nor left, what motivates these political actors? In this endeavor, particular attention is given to transnational material formations that have inaugurated and facilitated gay conservative movements in particular but that speak questions of subjectivity and progress in broader ways. A few include: narco trafficking, aesthetics, atheistic and theistic Satanisms, BDSM, contemporary science, the HIV/AIDS crisis, prosperity gospel, and the rise of neoliberalism in the Americas.  James Rodriguez entered NYU's American Studies PhD program in 2012 following his graduation from Brooklyn College, where he obtained a BA in both English and Psychology.

Stuart Schrader is a sixth-year PhD candidate in American Studies. His dissertation is entitled \"American Streets, Foreign Territory: How Counterinsurgent Knowledge Militarized Policing and Criminalized Color,\" for which he was awarded the Mellon/American Council of Learned Societies Dissertation Completion Fellowship. The dissertation examines transformations in policing that occurred in response to 1960s political struggles in the United States. These transformations, often characterized as the War on Crime and the rise of the carceral state, relied, the dissertation argues, on transnational networks of social scientists and policing and counterinsurgency experts. He has published in American Quarterly, Social Text: Periscope, CITY: Analysis of Urban Trends, NACLA Report on the Americas, Brooklyn Rail, and Maximum Rocknroll.   Jackson Smith is a first-year doctoral student in American Studies. He is broadly concerned with how practices of dispossession shape urban futures. As an undergraduate he conducted original archival research on the squatters\u2019 movement on the gentrifying Lower East Side. This research culminated with his article in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory, as well as his participation from 2011 to 2014 with the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS), a storefront museum about squatting and community gardening in the East Village. He was the co-founder and curator of the MoRUS Film Fest in 2013 and 2014. Although continuing to research urban redevelopment by asking how international investment practices materially transform the city, Jackson has recently taken up dispossession as a socio-legal problem. He is devising a research project on civil asset forfeiture, a legal device that enables law enforcement to seize currency and other property outside of criminal proceedings. Civil forfeiture is premised upon the legal culpability of objects rather than people and effectively terminates the due process rights of the liberal subject. His research on the phenomenon will chart its legal formation during the 1970s and 1980s and ethnographically investigate its utilization to seize homes in contemporary Philadelphia.

Sam Markwell is a first-year PhD student with an MA in American Studies from the University of New Mexico. His work is situated in the fields of historical materialism, anthropology, geography, Native studies, settler colonial studies, and ethnic studies. His research investigates the array of concepts and apparatuses of \"security\" that animate U.S. and Israeli settler colonial projects, specifically focusing on contestations over food and water infrastructures. By critiquing the roles played by the U.S. and Israel in shaping life in these regions, he aims to reorient the study of security away from the priorities and frameworks of the settler nation-state to alternative political and ethical geographies of the Americas and West Asia.

Brian Ray  is a third-year doctoral student in American Studies who works in the transnational history of capitalism and social movements, queer studies, science studies, and transnational religion studies. He holds a BA in Women's Studies and Philosophy from the University of Georgia. His dissertation project is a transdisciplinary study of gay conservative activism and thought in the U.S. and Mexico. Tentatively, he conceives of gay conservatism as a post-WWII political \"third-way\" movement that poses interesting questions regarding left/right political identification, subjectivity, and the structure of history. Drawing on immanent critique and biopolitical frameworks, his project is in conversation with reconfigurations of Thomas Frank's infamous \"What's the matter with Kansas?\", like Bethany Moreton's reversal \"What matters to Arkansas?\" As such, his project explores how some counterintuitive or seemingly frustrated political identifications, like gay conservatives, are made possible by mapping the ethical substance of self-proclaimed post-partisan politics. Without psychologizing them, neither right nor left, what motivates these political actors? In this endeavor, particular attention is given to transnational material formations that have inaugurated and facilitated gay conservative movements in particular but that speak questions of subjectivity and progress in broader ways. A few include: narco trafficking, aesthetics, atheistic and theistic Satanisms, BDSM, contemporary science, the HIV/AIDS crisis, prosperity gospel, and the rise of neoliberalism in the Americas.  James Rodriguez entered NYU's American Studies PhD program in 2012 following his graduation from Brooklyn College, where he obtained a BA in both English and Psychology. His senior thesis, Divide on the Lower East Side, laid the groundwork for his research interests in gentrification, public-housing, neighborhood ethnography, and community responses to urban change.

Most recently, he worked as a contributor to the Advertising Educational Foundation and The Smithsonian Institution's online exhibition, Race, Ethnicity, and Advertising in America 1890-1900.  Stuart Schrader is a sixth-year PhD candidate in American Studies. His dissertation is entitled \"American Streets, Foreign Territory: How Counterinsurgent Knowledge Militarized Policing and Criminalized Color,\" for which he was awarded the Mellon/American Council of Learned Societies Dissertation Completion Fellowship. The dissertation examines transformations in policing that occurred in response to 1960s political struggles in the United States. These transformations, often characterized as the War on Crime and the rise of the carceral state, relied, the dissertation argues, on transnational networks of social scientists and policing and counterinsurgency experts. He has published in American Quarterly, Social Text: Periscope, CITY: Analysis of Urban Trends, NACLA Report on the Americas, Brooklyn Rail, and Maximum Rocknroll.   Jackson Smith is a first-year doctoral student in American Studies. He is broadly concerned with how practices of dispossession shape urban futures. As an undergraduate he conducted original archival research on the squatters\u2019 movement on the gentrifying Lower East Side. This research culminated with his article in Perspectives on Anarchist Theory, as well as his participation from 2011 to 2014 with the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space (MoRUS), a storefront museum about squatting and community gardening in the East Village. He was the co-founder and curator of the MoRUS Film Fest in 2013 and 2014. Although continuing to research urban redevelopment by asking how international investment practices materially transform the city, Jackson has recently taken up dispossession as a socio-legal problem. He is devising a research project on civil asset forfeiture, a legal device that enables law enforcement to seize currency and other property outside of criminal proceedings. Civil forfeiture is premised upon the legal culpability of objects rather than people and effectively terminates the due process rights of the liberal subject. His research on the phenomenon will chart its legal formation during the 1970s and 1980s and ethnographically investigate its utilization to seize homes in contemporary Philadelphia.          Jennifer Flores Sternad \u2019s work as an academic, curator and writer focuses on militant art, performance, and artistic practices aligned with left social movements in the Americas.
