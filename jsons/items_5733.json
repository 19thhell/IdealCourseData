The curriculum exposes students to a variety of endodontic techniques and new modalities of treatment.   Objectives   Upon successful completion of the International Program in Endodontics, participants will have an increased understanding of the biological basis of endodontic theory and practice.   Faculty   The program faculty is comprised of endodontists with many years of experience as educators and practitioners. They have lectured nationally and internationally and have published in leading endodontic texts and journals.   Course Components   Participants treat a variety of cases under the guidance of an experienced faculty comprised of highly regarded educators and clinicians. An array of lectures, seminars, conferences, and patient care/clinical experiences are offered to further develop the participant\u2019s expertise in the field of endodontics. The student will improve clinical skills by treating a wide variety of endodontic patients and will learn how to determine if a particular clinical situation requires consultation with other healthcare providers. The assessment and evaluation skills needed to explore endodontic literature and current research will be developed, and the student will be prepared to utilize new technology. Students will have access to the latest equipment, including operating microscopes, ultrasonic devices and rotary instruments. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.

This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    global outreach opportunities Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM                                                  Second Year                               Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course. The course enables the student to record the       patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and       periapical tissue evaluation. The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic       origin. An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for       establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis.                       Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities. The       biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented. The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are       introduced.                        Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component)         A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root       canal access, instrumentation and obturation. Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture       covering the goals and objectives for each exercise. Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand       and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises.                                                              Third Year                               Advanced Endodontics         This course, for third-year dental students, consists of a series of lectures on advanced endodontic topics. The       information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease.       Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of       prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed.   Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care       under faculty supervision. Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities       are emphasized.                                                              Fourth Year                               Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic       needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases.

The curriculum exposes students to a variety of endodontic techniques and new modalities of treatment.   Objectives   Upon successful completion of the International Program in Endodontics, participants will have an increased understanding of the biological basis of endodontic theory and practice.   Faculty   The program faculty is comprised of endodontists with many years of experience as educators and practitioners. They have lectured nationally and internationally and have published in leading endodontic texts and journals.   Course Components   Participants treat a variety of cases under the guidance of an experienced faculty comprised of highly regarded educators and clinicians. An array of lectures, seminars, conferences, and patient care/clinical experiences are offered to further develop the participant\u2019s expertise in the field of endodontics. The student will improve clinical skills by treating a wide variety of endodontic patients and will learn how to determine if a particular clinical situation requires consultation with other healthcare providers. The assessment and evaluation skills needed to explore endodontic literature and current research will be developed, and the student will be prepared to utilize new technology. Students will have access to the latest equipment, including operating microscopes, ultrasonic devices and rotary instruments. There are opportunities to participate in elective experiences such as teaching, research and society meetings. Ample time is made available for these and other individual student interests.

This goal is achieved by offering the dental student an integrated endodontic experience in didactics, laboratory exercises and patient care with an emphasis on differential diagnosis, emergency care and interdisciplinary treatment.                    meet our faculty Read More                    group practice directory Read More                    global outreach opportunities Read More                               PREDOCTORAL CURRICULUM                                                  Second Year                               Diagnosis of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         Endodontics is introduced as part of a multi-disciplinary course. The course enables the student to record the       patient's chief complaint, medical and dental history, as well as extra-and intraoral examination and pulp and       periapical tissue evaluation. The student will be able to differentiate pathosis of odontogenic and nonodontogenic       origin. An essential goal of this course is to present material that allows students to learn the methods for       establishing an accurate pulpal and periapical clinical diagnosis.                       Management of Oral Disease (Endodontic Component)         This course component introduces the student to nonsurgical and surgical endodontic treatment modalities. The       biological rationale of endodontic treatment is presented. The use of basic and new methods of instrumentation are       introduced.                        Complex Restoration I (Endodontic Preclinical Laboratory Technique Component)         A series of laboratory technique sessions introduce the dental student to the fundamental procedures involved in root       canal access, instrumentation and obturation. Each laboratory session is preceded by an instructional lecture       covering the goals and objectives for each exercise. Basic and advanced instruments and techniques involving hand       and rotary root canal preparation are included in course exercises.                                                              Third Year                               Advanced Endodontics         This course, for third-year dental students, consists of a series of lectures on advanced endodontic topics. The       information presented enables the student to examine, diagnosis and appropriately treat pulpal and periapical disease.       Students are also taught to evaluate and treat endodontic emergencies.The evaluation of outcomes in terms of       prognosis, possible complications and the restorative phase of treatment is stressed.   Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the third-year dental student with the opportunity to treat patients who require endodontic care       under faculty supervision. Correlations between endodontic biology and fundamental and current treatment modalities       are emphasized.                                                              Fourth Year                               Endodontic Clinic         This course provides the fourth-year dental student the opportunity to treat patients who have more complex endodontic       needs, including selected molars. Interdisciplinary concerns are also a component of treatment planning these cases.
