APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS       Application (online only)    Application Fee (payable by Major Credit card only)    Statement of Purpose    Resume/Curriculum Vitae    2 Letters of Recommendation    One official copy of transcripts from all institutions attended or attending (see transcript information below)    GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- see note below    See TOEFL requirements information below       REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHER CERTIFICATION       Teacher Certification Requirements          Mathematics major or 30 semester hours in mathematics that includes two semesters of calculus    3 semester hours of a language other than English. American Sign Language is acceptable.       NOTE(S)       This program leads to eligibility for New York State initial teachers certification.    All students admitted to the Masters program in Mathematics Education will have completed a bachelor's degree with a strong mathematics GPA. They must also have completed at least 30 credits of acceptable mathematics content at a Calculus 1 level and above. Two semesters of Calculus should have been taken as part of the 30 credits. Applicants who did not take a course in Linear Algebra and a course in Geometry may be required to complete one or both courses, in addition to their program requirements, prior to their graduation from NYU. Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.

Click on the \"Teacher Certification Requirements\" link for access to the form.    Unfortunately, NYU Steinhardt can not perform a transcript review prior to an applicant applying to our program. Transcripts will be reviewed in detail, as part of the application process, by the Admissions Committee.     GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- We review all applications individually and holistically, but our expectation is that successful candidates for admission to any NYU Steinhardt MA program in teacher education will have a minimum 3.0 undergraduate grade point average.    Test scores from either the GRE or the Miller Analogies Test are recommended but not required for applicants interested in beginning their studies in spring, summer or fall 2015 or spring 2016. Applicants intending to begin their studies in summer or fall 2016 and beyond will be required to submit test scores from either the GRE or the Miller Analogies Test.

Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.

Overview    Eligibility and Requirements    Junior/Senior Year Courses    MA Courses    Advising       Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.    Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.

APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS       Application (online only)    Application Fee (payable by Major Credit card only)    Statement of Purpose    Resume/Curriculum Vitae    2 Letters of Recommendation    One official copy of transcripts from all institutions attended or attending (see transcript information below)    GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- see note below    See TOEFL requirements information below       REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHER CERTIFICATION       Teacher Certification Requirements          Mathematics major or 30 semester hours in mathematics that includes two semesters of calculus    3 semester hours of a language other than English. American Sign Language is acceptable.       NOTE(S)       This program leads to eligibility for New York State initial teachers certification.    All students admitted to the Masters program in Mathematics Education will have completed a bachelor's degree with a strong mathematics GPA. They must also have completed at least 30 credits of acceptable mathematics content at a Calculus 1 level and above. Two semesters of Calculus should have been taken as part of the 30 credits. Applicants who did not take a course in Linear Algebra and a course in Geometry may be required to complete one or both courses, in addition to their program requirements, prior to their graduation from NYU. Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.

Transcripts will be reviewed in detail, as part of the application process, by the Admissions Committee.     GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- We review all applications individually and holistically, but our expectation is that successful candidates for admission to any NYU Steinhardt MA program in teacher education will have a minimum 3.0 undergraduate grade point average.    Test scores from either the GRE or the Miller Analogies Test are recommended but not required for applicants interested in beginning their studies in spring, summer or fall 2015 or spring 2016. Applicants intending to begin their studies in summer or fall 2016 and beyond will be required to submit test scores from either the GRE or the Miller Analogies Test.

When you complete the dual degree program, you will be eligible for New York State certification as a teacher of mathematics for grades 7-12.       Overview    Eligibility and Requirements    Junior/Senior Year Courses    MA Courses    Advising       Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.    Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.    Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.       Steinhardt Graduate Courses to be Completed During Junior or Senior Year    During their junior or senior year, CAS math majors complete 12 credits in Teaching Math in place of other electives. These 12 credits count as electives toward the BA degree in math from CAS.

Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams.

Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams.

Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.    Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.       Steinhardt Graduate Courses to be Completed During Junior or Senior Year    During their junior or senior year, CAS math majors complete 12 credits in Teaching Math in place of other electives. These 12 credits count as electives toward the BA degree in math from CAS.

Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.

Overview    Eligibility and Requirements    Junior/Senior Year Courses    MA Courses    Advising       Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.    Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.
