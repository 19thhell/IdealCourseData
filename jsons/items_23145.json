The Executive Education program consists of two highly-targeted sessions. The morning session, taught by Devereux Chatillon, will focus on matters pertaining to international publishing law, contract terms, best practices for negotiating rights and permissions in the global marketplace, and control of piracy. The afternoon session, taught by Matthew Baldacci, will examine effective strategies for marketing both print and e-books, including new technology and channels, recommended marketing and analytics tools, how to structure an effective marketing department, and helping authors to build and expand their online presence.   Chatillon, former senior vice president and general counsel of Scholastic Corporation and currently head of Chatillon Law, teaches Publishing and Internet Law in the NYU-SCPS M.S. in Publishing: Digital and Print Media program, which is part of the Center for Publishing .   Baldacci, vice president of marketing and sales operations at St. Martin's Press, part of Macmillan Publishers, teaches Introduction to Marketing and Branding in the program. Baldacci and Chatillon also will participate in panel discussions and cultural exchanges.   In addition to these two faculty members, Andrea Chambers, director of the Center for Publishing, and four students enrolled in M.S. in Publishing: Digital and Print media, will also attend SIBF. The students will work beside other volunteers from around the world, and will engage in various social and cultural activities.   &quot;The Center for Publishing's participation in SIBF represents a continuation of our efforts to share the knowledge and expertise of our esteemed faculty members with publishers in other regions of the world, and to foster literature and literacy through a greater understanding of publishing strategies and best practices,&quot; said Chambers. &quot;We also are pleased to provide our students with the opportunity to experience a meaningful intercultural exchange and wider exposure to the international breadth of our industry. We are very grateful to our partners at the Sharjah International Book Fair for making these opportunities possible.&quot;   Now in its second installment, SIBF's Professional Programme features a series of discussion sessions, lectures, workshops and symposiums, among other activities related to the publishing and book industry that are held prior to the fair. Attended by approximately 300 publishers from the Arab world and around the globe, the Programme acts as networking platform for the exchange of ideas and experiences. It also serves as an opportunity for its participants to benefit from the expertise of an elite group of professionals and specialists.   &quot;The rapid growth and expansion in Arab publishing of late has brought with it a distinct set of challenges, not the least of which is a need for skill enhancement programs, which is why SIBF is extremely pleased to be able to collaborate with the experienced faculty of NYU-SCPS to present this much-needed program,&quot; said SIBF Director Ahmed bin Rakkad Al Ameri. &quot;SIBF remains committed to ensuring the growth and prosperity of the UAE and the region's book industry and will continue to explore ways in which to add value to our offerings.&quot;          About the Sharjah International Book Fair        Sharjah International Book Fair ( www.sharjahbookfair.com ) is an annual event, initiated in 1982 under the patronage and guidance of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, in order to promote reading, publishing, and literary activities.

More than 1,000 publishers participate in the fair and the number of visitors totals more than 600,000.   It is a practice for many of the public libraries, universities, educational institutions, and general organizations from the UAE and other GCC states to do their annual book purchases from SIBF.

The Translation Grants are provided by SIBF to publishers to support the translation of books from and to different languages with the aim of promoting culture worldwide. In addition to the rights session and Translation Grants, SIBF includes a professional program, literary seminars and workshops, along with the presence of literary professionals, award-winning authors, media personalities, dignitaries, and celebrities from all over the world.

Baldacci and Chatillon also will participate in panel discussions and cultural exchanges.   In addition to these two faculty members, Andrea Chambers, director of the Center for Publishing, and four students enrolled in M.S. in Publishing: Digital and Print media, will also attend SIBF. The students will work beside other volunteers from around the world, and will engage in various social and cultural activities.   &quot;The Center for Publishing's participation in SIBF represents a continuation of our efforts to share the knowledge and expertise of our esteemed faculty members with publishers in other regions of the world, and to foster literature and literacy through a greater understanding of publishing strategies and best practices,&quot; said Chambers. &quot;We also are pleased to provide our students with the opportunity to experience a meaningful intercultural exchange and wider exposure to the international breadth of our industry. We are very grateful to our partners at the Sharjah International Book Fair for making these opportunities possible.&quot;   Now in its second installment, SIBF's Professional Programme features a series of discussion sessions, lectures, workshops and symposiums, among other activities related to the publishing and book industry that are held prior to the fair. Attended by approximately 300 publishers from the Arab world and around the globe, the Programme acts as networking platform for the exchange of ideas and experiences. It also serves as an opportunity for its participants to benefit from the expertise of an elite group of professionals and specialists.   &quot;The rapid growth and expansion in Arab publishing of late has brought with it a distinct set of challenges, not the least of which is a need for skill enhancement programs, which is why SIBF is extremely pleased to be able to collaborate with the experienced faculty of NYU-SCPS to present this much-needed program,&quot; said SIBF Director Ahmed bin Rakkad Al Ameri. &quot;SIBF remains committed to ensuring the growth and prosperity of the UAE and the region's book industry and will continue to explore ways in which to add value to our offerings.&quot;          About the Sharjah International Book Fair        Sharjah International Book Fair ( www.sharjahbookfair.com ) is an annual event, initiated in 1982 under the patronage and guidance of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammad Al Qasimi, Member of the Supreme Council and Ruler of Sharjah, in order to promote reading, publishing, and literary activities. The 32nd session of Sharjah International Book Fair (SIBF 2013) will take place in the Sharjah Expo Centre.   SIBF is considered to be the gateway to the huge Arab/international book market; all the main publishers, distributors and book-sellers from the region participate in this event. It has established itself as a multilingual book fair, showcasing more than 385,000 titles from around the world. More than 1,000 publishers participate in the fair and the number of visitors totals more than 600,000.   It is a practice for many of the public libraries, universities, educational institutions, and general organizations from the UAE and other GCC states to do their annual book purchases from SIBF. Any agreement signed during the Professional Program (rights session), for translating a book from any language to Arabic or vice versa, shall be eligible for the SIBF Translation Grant, which is estimated at $4,000 for adult books and $1,500 for children's books. The Translation Grants are provided by SIBF to publishers to support the translation of books from and to different languages with the aim of promoting culture worldwide. In addition to the rights session and Translation Grants, SIBF includes a professional program, literary seminars and workshops, along with the presence of literary professionals, award-winning authors, media personalities, dignitaries, and celebrities from all over the world.
