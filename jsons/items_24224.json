APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS       Application (online only)    Application Fee (payable by Major Credit card only)    Statement of Purpose    Resume/Curriculum Vitae    2 Letters of Recommendation    One official copy of transcripts from all institutions attended or attending (see transcript information below)    GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- see note below    See TOEFL requirements information below       REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHER CERTIFICATION       Teacher Certification Requirements          Mathematics major or 30 semester hours in mathematics that includes two semesters of calculus    3 semester hours of a language other than English. American Sign Language is acceptable.       NOTE(S)       This program leads to eligibility for New York State initial teachers certification.    All students admitted to the Masters program in Mathematics Education will have completed a bachelor's degree with a strong mathematics GPA. They must also have completed at least 30 credits of acceptable mathematics content at a Calculus 1 level and above. Two semesters of Calculus should have been taken as part of the 30 credits. Applicants who did not take a course in Linear Algebra and a course in Geometry may be required to complete one or both courses, in addition to their program requirements, prior to their graduation from NYU. Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.

Click on the \"Teacher Certification Requirements\" link for access to the form.    Unfortunately, NYU Steinhardt can not perform a transcript review prior to an applicant applying to our program. Transcripts will be reviewed in detail, as part of the application process, by the Admissions Committee.     GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- We review all applications individually and holistically, but our expectation is that successful candidates for admission to any NYU Steinhardt MA program in teacher education will have a minimum 3.0 undergraduate grade point average.    Test scores from either the GRE or the Miller Analogies Test are recommended but not required for applicants interested in beginning their studies in spring, summer or fall 2015 or spring 2016. Applicants intending to begin their studies in summer or fall 2016 and beyond will be required to submit test scores from either the GRE or the Miller Analogies Test.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, BS    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide, and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education, and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual BA Math/MA Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a BA Math/MA Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science, and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual-degree programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    Minors    * Teacher Education * Global and Urban Education Studies    Mathematics Education, MA    The master's degree program in mathematics education prepares students to teach at the middle school through high school level. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Teaching and Learning with a Focus on Mathematics Education, PhD    The focus of our doctoral program is to develop your abilities to do research in mathematics education at the elementary, secondary, or post-secondary level, for students who would like to pursue a PhD in Teaching and Learning, with a focus on mathematics education.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, BS    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide, and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education, and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual BA Math/MA Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a BA Math/MA Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science, and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual-degree programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    Minors    * Teacher Education * Global and Urban Education Studies    Mathematics Education, MA    The master's degree program in mathematics education prepares students to teach at the middle school through high school level. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, BS    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide, and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education, and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual BA Math/MA Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a BA Math/MA Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science, and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case.

Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, BS    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide, and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education, and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual BA Math/MA Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a BA Math/MA Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their BA from the College of Arts and Science, and an MA in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the BA/MA Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual-degree programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    Minors    * Teacher Education * Global and Urban Education Studies    Mathematics Education, MA    The master's degree program in mathematics education prepares students to teach at the middle school through high school level. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Teaching and Learning with a Focus on Mathematics Education, PhD    The focus of our doctoral program is to develop your abilities to do research in mathematics education at the elementary, secondary, or post-secondary level, for students who would like to pursue a PhD in Teaching and Learning, with a focus on mathematics education.

APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS       Application (online only)    Application Fee (payable by Major Credit card only)    Statement of Purpose    Resume/Curriculum Vitae    2 Letters of Recommendation    One official copy of transcripts from all institutions attended or attending (see transcript information below)    GRE or Miller Analogies Test -- see note below    See TOEFL requirements information below       REQUIREMENTS FOR TEACHER CERTIFICATION       Teacher Certification Requirements          Mathematics major or 30 semester hours in mathematics that includes two semesters of calculus    3 semester hours of a language other than English. American Sign Language is acceptable.       NOTE(S)       This program leads to eligibility for New York State initial teachers certification.    All students admitted to the Masters program in Mathematics Education will have completed a bachelor's degree with a strong mathematics GPA. They must also have completed at least 30 credits of acceptable mathematics content at a Calculus 1 level and above. Two semesters of Calculus should have been taken as part of the 30 credits. Applicants who did not take a course in Linear Algebra and a course in Geometry may be required to complete one or both courses, in addition to their program requirements, prior to their graduation from NYU. Applicants must also have taken and passed three semester hours at the college level of a foreign language or sign language.    The Admissions Committee performs a full transcript review to evaluate courses appearing on all college transcript(s). Advanced Placement (AP) and CLEP credits are included in the review. Therefore it is important to provide official transcripts from all institutions attended. Failure to provide an official transcript from institutions listed on applicants' current transcript as transfer credits will significantly delay the application process.    Any deficiencies in the teacher certification core content requirements may be fulfilled by enrolling in college-level courses at any accredited college or by completing approved CLEP exams. Courses must bear academic credit and show a grade, equivalent to \"C\" or better for consideration. Pass/Fail course are not considered.    If there are courses an applicant plan to take that are not listed on a transcript, inform the Admissions Committee by completing the \"Courses in Progress Form\".
