Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.

Rubinstein first fell in love with caf\u00e9s in 1978 on a visit to Vienna, and quickly learned that, like many great thinkers before him, he\u2019s the type who prefers the gentle commotion of the coffee shop to the sterile silence of an office. On that first encounter with Viennese caf\u00e9 culture as a PhD student, he joined the ranks of 19th-century artists, politicians, and writers like Gustav Klimt, Sigmund Freud, and Leon Trotsky in an intellectual &raquo;                                                 NYU on Saturday Night Live    No matter how old he got, the comedian Jack Benny used to host an annual 39th birthday party for himself. But for Saturday Night Live, turning 40 was a cause for celebration\u2014especially when more than 23 million people tuned in on Feb. 15, 2015 to watch its marathon of a reunion show. A peerless cultural force for comedy since 1975, the show has launched the careers of such heavyweights as Tina Fey, Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, Amy Poehler, and Jimmy Fallon.

He shivers on deck and grips the rail tightly as the great ship struggles against the ocean\u2019s whims. Like many immigrants before him, he longs for opportunity and a fresh start. But unlike the protagonist in so many narratives of this type, his coat isn\u2019t tattered or frayed. His shoes have no holes.

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district). Each semester, NYU London staff plans day trips to places such as the historic cities of Bath, Cambridge, and Oxford. In addition to exploring London\u2019s myriad cultural sites, students often participate in short-term or semester-long community service projects.

(Affectionately called, Six Degrees of NYU)    You live in a university dorm, and still have a hour commute to campus    When at least two dorms on campus have maid service    When you have to identify yourself every single time you go into your dorm, no matter if you just walked out of it    When you need to close your blinds while undressing so the businessmen across the way won't get a free show    You inhale deeply on the South Route bus. What else? Fish!    Two words: Hand scanners!!    Your dorm used to be a nightclub    Your dorm elevator only stops on certain floors    Your dorm is conveniently located between a corrections facility and a homeless shelter    Sometimes you're too lazy to order take out because you would have to walk downstairs    Getting shafted in housing means going to the #2 ranked dorm in America    Your desk chairs rock back and forth (and you know it is possible to fall backwards)   You're used to random people being lowered past your window   There is nothing quite like a 3am fire drill    You are woken up by the garbage men but no longer notice sirens    Jeanene Garafolo, Liv Tyler and Ben Stiller live across the street    You don't know the meaning of communal bathrooms    You're excited because there is a 24 hour sex shop right around the corner from your dorm    You understand why Weinstein is called the \"concrete prison\"              Social Scene       Every guy you meet has a 1/3 chance of being gay. If he is attractive, the odds go up to 1/2. Attractive and well dressed? Forget it, sweetie.    When being white and heterosexual is a minority    \"Are you heterophobic? Come to the heterophobic club, only at NYU!\"    \"Parties\" contain no more than 20 people and are broken up by 1am at the latest.    Getting signed into the party takes as long as the party itself.    When a \"frat\" party is a sure thing you won't have fun.    When \"Sorority Row\" is a hallway    You've starred in an NYU student film, whether you know the director or not    Your RA did the Rocky Horror Show at orientation    University protests top million people    When you go to school with Robin Williams' son, Joshua Jackson's sister, Ron Howard's daughter, and Steve the Dell Guy.    Ignoring people is a way of life    You have gotten drunk and cursed out the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree for not being lit up at 2 AM.    Half your friends are from Long Island, the other half from New Jersey              Academics       Your mascot is either a flower or the library card catalog    The football team is undefeated.because it doesn't exist    You can take Irish language as a course and not think it's weird    When the chemistry department is located in the Triangle Shirtwaist building    When your graduating class is just in college waiting for their big break    People have studio instead of classes    You walk into Stern without a suit and people give you funny looks    You pay the highest tuition in the world (thank you John Sexton!)    You hate Columbia with a passion, mainly because you didn't get in    You take class field trips to the MET    There is always a reason for a walk out              Campus       Two words: Elevator Rage.    Despite what the posters say, \"Real Food\" cannot be found at Weinstein    You know the Silver Center is actually Main Building    Your campus lawn is also home to bums and pot dealers. (hey, it's not NYU without the park)    When you can run into Matt Damon more than once at the Astor Place Starbucks    You've been chased by a homeless man    When the only way to get a tan is to lie out on the sidewalks of NYC    Tischies and Sternies can immediately be identified at first glance.    When you take the N/R from Union Square one stop to campus every time it rains or snows    When your university is the largest private real estate holder in the city    When \"Move all the way in! Make room for a friend!\" has special meaning    You know the J train doesn't really exist    You can ask the question whether the street still smells like fish, or already smells like fish    You've seen Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld or Will Farrell at the comedy cellar    You scream in exasperation \"No! I don't want to go to your comedy club! I don't like to laugh!\"    The people at Starbucks know your order.    There is always construction, but nothing actually seems to change    You go for a walk in flip-flops and when you come back and your toes are black    You say excuse me to pigeons    Every cab ride could be your last    Chelsea counts as uptown    You've been hit on by national guard guys at the subway    Tourists have taken pictures of you (you're a \"real NYU student\"!)    You accidentally wander onto film sets    You know the bums on the street by name    You own a copy of 366 lovemaking positions, purchased for a dollar    Everyone on the street has headphones on or a cell phone    The highlight of the day is the return of Mr. Softee    The snow is either a lovely shade of yellow or brown    You've studied the subway map so many times that you've finally realized Manhattan looks like a penis"}]}]
