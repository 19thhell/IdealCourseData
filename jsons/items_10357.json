                    Back to Previous Page         Course Offerings     Placement    All students with previous study of German should take a placement examination before registering for their first courses in those languages; see \" Placement Examinations \" in the Academic Policies section of this Bulletin. The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities.      Language Requirement    The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement in German. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses. Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence.      Basic Language Courses in German    All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementary-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate-level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.

Traces basic themes and examines narrative, dramatic, and lyric structures in poetry.    Topics in 19th Century Literature GERM-UA 397 Offered periodically. 4 points. Course focuses on 19th-century German literature by examining various intersections between cultural, social, and scientific discourse. Study of German novellas and drama from romanticism to realism and naturalism with a focus on form, genre, and narrativity.     Advanced Seminars Conducted in German (400 Level)    These courses examine authors, groups of works, and intellectual, aesthetic, and social movements of particular significance in the development of German literature and culture. These courses have a narrower focus than do those at the 300 level; the emphasis is on in-depth examination rather than on overview. Readings are longer and more linguistically demanding than those used at the previous level. Language work focuses on conjecture and the expression of abstract concepts, in both written and spoken German.    Goethe GERM-UA 455 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines Goethe as the pivotal literary figure of his time. Considers Goethe's prose, poetry, and drama from the late Enlightenment through storm and stress to classicism and beyond.    The Age of Goethe GERM-UA 456 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines German reaction to the Enlightenment in the literature of storm and stress and of classicism. Considers irrationalism, social protest, and Humanit\u00e4tsdichtung as successive stages of the expansion of consciousness in an age in which Goethe was the central, but not the only significant, literary figure. Readings include Herder, Von der Urpoesie der V\u00f6lker and selected poems; Lenz, Die Soldaten; Schiller, Die R\u00e4uber, Kabale und Liebe, Maria Stuart, and selected poems; and H\u00f6lderlin, selected poems.    Faust GERM-UA 457 Offered periodically. 4 points. Examines the figure of Faust in legend and literature, beginning with its first appearance in the 16th century. Discussion of the influence of Faust in German and other European literary traditions. Readings include excerpts from the 1587 Historia von D. Johann Fausten; Goethe's Urfaust and excerpts from his later dramatic versions (Faust, Ein Fragment; Faust I and II); and Thomas Mann's Doktor Faustus.    Literature of the Weimar Period GERM-UA 468 Offered periodically. 4 points. The chaotic Weimar period (1918-33) began with a revolution and ended with the takeover by the Nazis. During these few years, German modernism evolved from expressionism to the aesthetics of new sobriety (Neue Sachlichkeit). From the more traditional (Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse) to the experimental and revolutionary (Bertolt Brecht, Anna Seghers), the works of this period draw into question its subsequent glorification as the golden '20s. Readings include works by Brecht, Hesse, Roth, Seghers, Klaus Mann, and Thomas Mann.    Minority Discourses GERM-UA 475 Offered periodically. 4 points. In recent years, literary productions have emerged that fall under the heading of \"minority\" literatures, often understood as texts written in German by so-called foreigners. This course examines this notion critically and also analyzes the impact of individual works in relation to current debates on multiculturalism, integration, and national identity.    Seminar on 19th-Century Authors GERM-UA 487 Offered periodically. 4 points.    Seminar on 20th-Century Authors GERM-UA 488 Offered periodically. 4 points. Each of these courses provides advanced students of German with an in-depth knowledge of one major author of either the 19th or 20th century. Works of the chosen author are examined in terms of how he or she contributes to, and possibly challenges, prevailing aesthetic, political, and cultural trends of his or her time.
