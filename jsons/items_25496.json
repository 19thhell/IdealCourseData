Completion of a final project (or thesis for those seeking to continue their graduate work) is also required. Full-time students typically complete the program in 3 semesters.

A variety of perspectives from biologists, economists, environmentalists, historians, naturalists, philosophers, political scientists, and theologians provide the material to analyze the interaction between human culture and nature with the goal to understand the impacts of human action on the natural world, and the ways natural forces affect civilization change. One aspect of our inquiry is to review the underlying value assumptions of the worldviews and institutions that mediate our actions toward the environment.                ENYC-GE 2005             Cities and Their Environments          The course focuses on recognizing and assessing the complex interrelationships between the city and its environment. The central problem is the alienation of urban residents from their surrounding environments. Different frameworks for integrative analysis of human-environment relationships are used&ndash;from human ecology to geography to resilience. The intent is to re-conceptualize the city in ways that make these phenomena explicit, and to communicate this to multiple publics. Students will also learn to conduct a quick sustainability assessment of a local neighborhood and develop a communication plan for it.                ENYC-GE 2021          Environmental Politics          This course examines environmental politics with an emphasis on the American political system. Students will receive a broad introduction to the key concepts, actors, stakeholders, issues, and concerns related to this subject. Course material focuses on the role of government organizations - at the federal, state, and local level - institutional processes, and nongovernmental entities involved in environmental politics and policymaking. Throughout the semester, we will address substantive environmental policy issues, such as water and air pollution, hazardous waste, biodiversity, and land use. At the conclusion of the semester, students should have an understanding of the historical, cultural, institutional, and ideological forces shaping environmental policy and regulations in the United States.                ENYC-GE 2022          Environmental Education: Theory and Practice          Introduction to environmental education with particular emphasis on theoretical and practical applications. Historical and philosophical perspectives will be explored in relation to current topics in environmental education and implications for school reform. We will examine national and local models of environmental education, and analyze their relationship to contemporary issues of environmental literacy. Case studies will be drawn from a wide range of educational settings. Guest presenters, web-based resources, and field study projects will help students develop a portrait of environmental education with particular emphasis on urban settings. Students will develop competencies in planning environmental education programs.                ENYC-GE 2023          Final Seminar in Environmental Conservation Education          Review and integration of leading conceptions encountered in the program through critical analysis of major conceptual writings on environmental issues. Formulation and completion of a thesis or research project.                ENYC-GE 2024          Internship in Environmental Conservation Education          Students spend one semester in a business, organization, school, or center that is involved in environmental education. Each placement and identification of responsibilities is negotiated in light of student interests and the activities of the cooperating institution. Students will attend a bi-weekly seminar to facilitate their internship work experience.

Field Studies in Ecology at the Black Rock Forest in Cornwall, New York, is a concentrated summer field course in ecology with a focus on field botany, forest biology, plant-environment interrelationships, and sampling techniques.    Students become familiar with the flora and fauna of the Hudson Highlands as they study the major natural habitats within the forest. Field exercises include plant community sampling; paleoecological analysis of sediment cores; characterization of shrub communities using diagnostic keys; and surveys of birds, insects, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates. Our class is scheduled during peak bird migration and flowering. Readings from Science, Nature, Ecology , and other relevant literature are carefully coordinated with our field studies. (There is an additional fee for room and board.)                ENYC-GE 2070          Urban Ecology          In Urban Ecology, students will explore ecological concepts and processes in the urban environment. Through lecture and field work, students will learn about the dynamics of urban ecology, and the impacts of land use and pollution on wildlife and local habitats. Topics will include population ecology, ecosystem services, and human impacts. Specifically we will study exotic and invasive plants and birds in local wetlands and woodlands, the migration of neo-tropical songbirds, and population fluctuations of birds and plants as indicators of environmental change while examining the interface between natural and built environments in the urban landscape.                ENYC-GE 2010          Sustainable Places: Social and Ecological Field Studies          Students will learn and practice the design and organization of the nature park experience. In so doing, they deepen their awareness of human-nature relationships, and develop professional skills in environmental advocacy. The course involves class meetings on campus, followed by a required field visit and travel to the remote study site, and production of a final deliverable consisting of key elements of a nature park master plan. ECE students will evaluate and design environmental education elements, and students from other disciplines can develop a sustainability plan .                SCIED-GE 2050             Using NYC&rsquo;s Nonformal Resources to Teach Science       Students explore non-formal settings, learn about resources, consider their roles as teachers and learners, and link activities with inquiry, reflection, practice, and real-world experiences. The course is designed to expose formal and non-formal educators to field-based learning and linkages between formal and non-formal learning. Class sessions meet on selected Fridays in a variety of museums, parks, and non-profit organizations and on the NYU campus. (Time will vary depending on field site.)

Required Core Courses             Course Number       Course Title       Course Description             ENYC-GE 2019             Foundations of Environmental Thought             This course examines prominent worldviews that have guided human action toward the natural world. A variety of perspectives from biologists, economists, environmentalists, historians, naturalists, philosophers, political scientists, and theologians provide the material to analyze the interaction between human culture and nature with the goal to understand the impacts of human action on the natural world, and the ways natural forces affect civilization change. One aspect of our inquiry is to review the underlying value assumptions of the worldviews and institutions that mediate our actions toward the environment.                ENYC-GE 2005             Cities and Their Environments          The course focuses on recognizing and assessing the complex interrelationships between the city and its environment. The central problem is the alienation of urban residents from their surrounding environments. Different frameworks for integrative analysis of human-environment relationships are used&ndash;from human ecology to geography to resilience. The intent is to re-conceptualize the city in ways that make these phenomena explicit, and to communicate this to multiple publics. Students will also learn to conduct a quick sustainability assessment of a local neighborhood and develop a communication plan for it.                ENYC-GE 2021          Environmental Politics          This course examines environmental politics with an emphasis on the American political system. Students will receive a broad introduction to the key concepts, actors, stakeholders, issues, and concerns related to this subject. Course material focuses on the role of government organizations - at the federal, state, and local level - institutional processes, and nongovernmental entities involved in environmental politics and policymaking. Throughout the semester, we will address substantive environmental policy issues, such as water and air pollution, hazardous waste, biodiversity, and land use. At the conclusion of the semester, students should have an understanding of the historical, cultural, institutional, and ideological forces shaping environmental policy and regulations in the United States.                ENYC-GE 2022          Environmental Education: Theory and Practice          Introduction to environmental education with particular emphasis on theoretical and practical applications. Historical and philosophical perspectives will be explored in relation to current topics in environmental education and implications for school reform. We will examine national and local models of environmental education, and analyze their relationship to contemporary issues of environmental literacy. Case studies will be drawn from a wide range of educational settings. Guest presenters, web-based resources, and field study projects will help students develop a portrait of environmental education with particular emphasis on urban settings. Students will develop competencies in planning environmental education programs.                ENYC-GE 2023          Final Seminar in Environmental Conservation Education          Review and integration of leading conceptions encountered in the program through critical analysis of major conceptual writings on environmental issues. Formulation and completion of a thesis or research project.                ENYC-GE 2024          Internship in Environmental Conservation Education          Students spend one semester in a business, organization, school, or center that is involved in environmental education. Each placement and identification of responsibilities is negotiated in light of student interests and the activities of the cooperating institution. Students will attend a bi-weekly seminar to facilitate their internship work experience.                ECE/SciEd Program Electives             Course Number       Course Title       Course Description             SCIED-GE 2052          Field Ecology          This course may be used to fulfill the ecology requirement. Field Studies in Ecology at the Black Rock Forest in Cornwall, New York, is a concentrated summer field course in ecology with a focus on field botany, forest biology, plant-environment interrelationships, and sampling techniques.    Students become familiar with the flora and fauna of the Hudson Highlands as they study the major natural habitats within the forest. Field exercises include plant community sampling; paleoecological analysis of sediment cores; characterization of shrub communities using diagnostic keys; and surveys of birds, insects, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates. Our class is scheduled during peak bird migration and flowering. Readings from Science, Nature, Ecology , and other relevant literature are carefully coordinated with our field studies. (There is an additional fee for room and board.)                ENYC-GE 2070          Urban Ecology          In Urban Ecology, students will explore ecological concepts and processes in the urban environment. Through lecture and field work, students will learn about the dynamics of urban ecology, and the impacts of land use and pollution on wildlife and local habitats. Topics will include population ecology, ecosystem services, and human impacts. Specifically we will study exotic and invasive plants and birds in local wetlands and woodlands, the migration of neo-tropical songbirds, and population fluctuations of birds and plants as indicators of environmental change while examining the interface between natural and built environments in the urban landscape.                ENYC-GE 2010          Sustainable Places: Social and Ecological Field Studies          Students will learn and practice the design and organization of the nature park experience. In so doing, they deepen their awareness of human-nature relationships, and develop professional skills in environmental advocacy. The course involves class meetings on campus, followed by a required field visit and travel to the remote study site, and production of a final deliverable consisting of key elements of a nature park master plan. ECE students will evaluate and design environmental education elements, and students from other disciplines can develop a sustainability plan .                SCIED-GE 2050             Using NYC&rsquo;s Nonformal Resources to Teach Science       Students explore non-formal settings, learn about resources, consider their roles as teachers and learners, and link activities with inquiry, reflection, practice, and real-world experiences. The course is designed to expose formal and non-formal educators to field-based learning and linkages between formal and non-formal learning. Class sessions meet on selected Fridays in a variety of museums, parks, and non-profit organizations and on the NYU campus. (Time will vary depending on field site.)                 Other Electives    Alternative electives are also possible after consultation with your adviser.

We understand opportunities for environmental conservation to occur in multiple settings: in the heart of the city, in tropical rainforests, and in informal settlements. We are a diverse community and welcome students from all over the globe.    What you'll learn    You will work with faculty from a wide variety of disciplines, including education, history, and philosophy, law, journalism, science, health, and the arts, and learn how to:       Critique the profound effects of human activity on the planet    Identify and apply environmental theories and policies across a broad range of formal and non-formal settings, both locally and globally, such as schools, cultural institutions, government agencies, and non- and for-profit organizations    Describe national and local models of environmental education, analyze contemporary environmental issues, and implement environmental education as an interdisciplinary tool in fostering environmental literacy and sustainability    Develop competencies in environmental education, including program design, curriculum development, evaluation, grant writing, policy analysis, and non-profit management       See the curriculum and degree requirements for this master's degree.    Read more about students and faculty in our program brochure (.pdf).    How you'll learn    Core Courses Core courses in environmental thought, cities and their environment, and environmental politics will introduce you to the theories, policies, and ethics that have shaped public discourse and understanding of our environment.
