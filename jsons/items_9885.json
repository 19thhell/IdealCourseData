Because it has applications to nearly every branch of science and engineering, it\u2019s essential for mathematicians to think about how their work infiltrates other branches of learning. Advances in physics \u2014 for example, those in electromagnetism and thermodynamics \u2014 often resonate deeply with mathematics. At the School of Engineering, the BS in Applied Physics and Mathematics program serves as a means to bridge these 2 disciplines. The dual major allows you to gain a foothold in separate but substantial fields. In addition to learning the fundamentals of physics and math, our students pursue a specialized course of study that a minor in either field just can\u2019t match. But we also want to make sure your skills transfer over to the real world. That\u2019s why we provide internship opportunities at major financial, insurance, and technology firms in the New York area. Students with experience in both mathematics and physics enjoy diverse and interesting careers. Our graduates have the freedom to explore such stimulating fields as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering. They\u2019re also qualified for positions in software design, economics, aerospace engineering, law, and business.                                     Program Manager        Lorcan M.
