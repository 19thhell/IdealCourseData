PORT-GA 1104 Title: Portuguese for Spanish Speakers Instructor : Carlos Veloso Day/Time: Tuesday 6-8pm   Description: PORT-GA 1104 is an accelerated course for advanced Spanish speakers with a good command of Spanish grammar. It covers the fundamentals of the Portuguese language with a focus on Brazil. In this course, Spanish sentence patterns and vocabulary will be utilized as a basis for the study of similarities and differences between the two languages. Comparisons among sound systems (Spanish/English/Portuguese) will familiarize students with standard Portuguese pronunciation. Written responses to short readings ( cr\u00f4nicas , poetry, essays and articles) or visuals will help to review and expand grammar points and to practice transferring common features of Spanish into Portuguese syntax. Brief presentations on topics related to the arts and society will promote essential speaking skills. By the end of the semester students will be prepared to read complex materials and will have acquired basic proficiency in speaking, writing and understanding standard Portuguese.      This is a zero credit course. A limited number of spots are available for students from other departments/programs. These spots will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Interested students should contact Kelly Stetter at kelly.stetter@nyu.edu for permission to enroll.          PORT-GA 2968 Title: Em via de transe : Spirit Possession and Political Subjectivity in Brazil Instructor : Dylon Robbins Day/Time: Tuesday 4-6pm   Description: This course will explore notions of trance consciousness as possible enactments of political subjectivity. Examples from Brazil, along with a few complementary instances from throughout the Americas, will be examined as modes of consciousness that differ in interesting ways from more conventional models. In an effort to further contextualize trance, our discussions will address, as well, a few related phenomena, such as the relationships between listening and subjectivity, ecstasy, messianism, and populism, as well as the social exchanges involved in music\u2019s reception, production, and performance. We will read texts by M\u00e1rio de Andrade, Machado de Assis, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Wisnik, Benjamin Costallat, Jo\u00e3o do Rio, Manuel Quirino, Edison Carneiro, Nina Rodrigues, Euclides da Cunha, Glauber Rocha, Roger Bastide, Alfred M\u00e9traux, and Michael Taussig. Points of comparison will be drawn with the ideas of Suely Rolnik, Felix Guattari, Gilles Delueze, Frantz Fanon, Ernesto Laclau, Slavoj Zizek, Gilbert Rouget, Theodor Adorno, and others.

SPAN-GA 2965 ( View Syllabus ) Title: Photography, Set Design, and Editing in Spanish Cinema (1925-1980) Instructor : Vicente S\u00e1nchez-Biosca, Visiting Professor (University of Valencia) Day/Time: Wednesday 6:20-8:20pm   Description: La historia del cine espa\u00f1ol no se construye en solitario. Las formas f\u00edlmicas y sus soportes t\u00e9cnicos surgen en contextos internacionales, se influencian, se mimetizan, buscando, eso s\u00ed, la manera de singularizarse. Por esta raz\u00f3n, no es razonable estudiar una cinematograf\u00eda como la espa\u00f1ola sin sacar a relucir el di\u00e1logo, expl\u00edcito o impl\u00edcito, de sumisi\u00f3n o resistencia, de negociaci\u00f3n en todo caso, que mantiene con otras cinematograf\u00edas, comenzando por las m\u00e1s influyentes y modelizadoras, con Hollywood a la cabeza.      M\u00e1s precisamente, la relaci\u00f3n entre tecnolog\u00eda y estilo puede aquilatarse mejor siguiendo un triple proceso que rige la factura del cine: la direcci\u00f3n de fotograf\u00eda (sensibilidad de la pel\u00edcula, ligereza de las c\u00e1maras, captaci\u00f3n de sonido\u2026), el dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n (concepci\u00f3n de decorados, rodaje en interiores, construcci\u00f3n de sets, pictoricismo\u2026) y el montaje (modelos de ensamblaje visual y sonoro, figuras de sutura y de discontinuidad\u2026). En el entramado que forman estos vectores, el cine espa\u00f1ol conforma su particularidad y su diferencia, sus herencias y sus apuestas. Este curso se propone analizar, siguiendo sus complejos ajustes y desajustes, algunos momentos de cristalizaci\u00f3n y de cambio, adoptando una perspectiva decididamente comparatista con modelos transnacionales. Organizado en torno a estudios de casos, y apostando por el an\u00e1lisis minucioso de secuencias, fragmentos y planos, la selecci\u00f3n operar\u00e1 por cortes hist\u00f3ricos en los que las nociones de clasicismo, modernidad, postmodernidad aparecen ligadas a escuelas o movimientos en los que el cine espa\u00f1ol entra en conflicto y negociaci\u00f3n con otras tradiciones (vanguardia, experimentaci\u00f3n, neorrealismo, film noir , direct cinema , entre otra).      This course will be conducted in Spanish and will be open to advanced undergraduates and MFA students, with permission of the instructor. For more information, interested students should contact Kelly Stetter at kelly.stetter@nyu.edu .        SPAN-GA 2966 Title: Entre imperios: La literatura espa\u00f1ola y la(s) conciencia(s) imperial(es) Instructor : James Fern\u00e1ndez Day/Time: Thursday 4-6pm   Description: Beginning with the rhetoric of empire of Francoism, we will work our way in reverse chronological order, through a series of Spanish texts that engage the question of empire and imperialism in Spanish culture. Primary texts will include: the script and film \u201cRaza\u201d; accounts by Spaniards of the NY of the 1920s (Lorca, Moreno Villa, Camba); works generated in the context of the fourth centenary of 1892; representations of the figure of the indiano in the mid-to late nineteenth century (Gald\u00f3s, Clar\u00edn, Pardo Baz\u00e1n and others); empire and romanticism in early nineteenth-century Spain (Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda, Duque de Rivas, Larra); empire and enlightenment in the late eighteenth century (Feijoo and Cadalso).        SPAN-GA 2967 Title: Deadly Subjects: Violence, Personhood and Necropower in Modern Mexico Instructor : Juan de Dios V\u00e1zquez Day/Time: Friday 2-4pm   Description: Violence is both irrational and based on reason. It has the power to subvert identity, while inciting scientific disciplines and highly structured artistic genres that try to define both criminal subjectivity and victimhood. Violence is the soil on which an extensive series of historical changes and moral apparatuses come together. It is also at the center of the emergence of new kinds of political authority, and in the surface of multiple forms of affect, cognition, moral responsibility and action. In this course we will investigate various manifestations of violence in twentieth-century Mexico, by focusing on how practices of violence were represented and ethically and politically evaluated, but also exploring what type of subjectivities have derived by them. In order to do so, we will examine a great array of images, videos, novels, news clippings, police archives, essays, etcetera; and consider the agents that produce and are produced by this violence. Furthermore, we will study the narrative content of the representations of violence within the context of their production and use, while discussing the particular agendas they serve. By this means, we will get a better understanding of the cultural forms made to portray these brutal acts, but also the social imaginaries and the political identities that emerge from them.      This course will be conducted in Spanish.        SPAN-GA 2968 Title: Mexican Muralism and North American End of Art Instructor : Eduardo Subirats Day/Time: Wednesday 4-6pm   Description: The Mexican Mural Movement has been one of the most energizing art movements in Latin America during the past century. This seminar will focus on the three main Mexican muralists (Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros) from the days of the Mexican Revolution to the sixties, and from the influences of European Expressionism and Cubism, to the rise of American Abstract Expressionism. The destruction of Rivera\u2019s Rockefeller center mural in 1934, the MoMA declaration of the identity modern=abstract in 1936, and the construction of an American abstract avant-garde in the late thirties marks a turning point\u2026      This course will be conducted in Spanish.          SPAN-GA 2976 ( View Syllabus ) Title: Gender Issues in Modern Spanish Writing and Film (1850s to the Present) Instructor : Jo Labanyi Day/Time: Tuesday 2-4pm   Description: The course will take students through a range of literary, essayistic, dramatic, and cinematic texts from the mid 19th century to the early 21st century, as a way of exploring a variety of critical approaches to gender. The primary aim is to develop proficiency in gender analysis as a form of cultural as well as textual criticism. Students will trace the historical development of attitudes to gender in modern Spain, both in cultural representations and in social and political discourse. The prescribed texts have been chosen to show how cultural representations can go against the dominant discourses of the historical period, as well as reflecting them. The texts also illustrate the ways in which prescribed gender roles can constrict or can be used strategically. A number of texts show how the gender divisions that have been a hallmark of western modernity are subverted by gender fluidity and/or a notion of gender as performance; other texts propose a model of sexual difference whereby women free themselves from male violence. A number of the texts explore alternatives to compulsory heterosexuality. Both masculinity and femininity will be interrogated.    The class will be taught in Spanish.          SPAN-GA 2977 Title: What's Left of Cuba? Culture, Politics, and Civil Society Instructor : Ana Dopico, Jill Lane, and Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz Day/Time: Monday 3:30-6pm   Description: Where is Cuba now in the geopolitical imaginary that once heralded Cuba as the exemplar of radical left projects in Latin America? In recent years, Cuban culture has challenged the projects of the revolution and has recast the cold war frames of embargo, exile, and exceptionalism. A new generation of writers, bloggers, visual and performance artists, and political activists and dissidents have insisted on freedom of expression, the rule of law, the politics of remembering, and the notion of civil society. Both on and off the island, many campaign \u201cfor an other Cuba\u201d (Por Otra Cuba), reclaiming the nation and challenging the state. From a burgeoning presence in social media to smaller, poignant acts of reclamation such as political tattoos and graffiti, these social actors are creating spaces of expression and action that open fissures and apertures in the discourse of the revolution and the control of the state. Although they vary in political philosophies, these new voices demand both universality and contingency: an agenda that mixes the politics of human rights, Cuban values, and the unfinished projects of both the republic and the revolution. In this seminar we explore this complex political formation and the new social subjects that it makes possible. We engage visual and performance art, photography, social media, cr\u00f3nica, music, video, film, and activism, including the work of Antonio Jose Ponte, the bloggers Yoani Sanch\u00e9z and Orlando Pardo Lazo, the internet sites Desde Cuba and Estado de Sats, and artists El Sexto, Omni Zona Franca, Coco Fusco, and Tania Bruguera, among others. As an interdisciplinary seminar organized by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the seminar is accompanied by a bi-weekly guest lecture series, held on Monday evenings.        SPAN-GA 2978 Title: Mutant Essays: Post-nationalism in the Caribbean Instructor : Rub\u00e9n R\u00edos \u00c1vila Day/Time: Wednesday 6-8pm   Description: This course examines the trials and tribulations of identity as the coagulating agent behind national and ethnic epiphanies of the Caribbean. Correspondingly, it takes a close look at the counter politics of erasure, (of a national or ethnic \u201cgiven\u201d) and how it operates as a poetics of deflation, where more diffuse, rhizomatic metaphors like the plantation, the diaspora, the archipelago, or the estuary, put to task the autonomy of the island as an empowering archetype for the stability of both the national and individual subject. Benitez Rojo\u2019s \u201cisla que se repite\u201d and Edouard Glissant\u2019s \u201cpo\u00e9tique de la relation\u201d provide key elements for this politics (and rhetoric) of disidentification, where the plantation hovers as a living dead, as a haunting economic corpse, and \u201crelation\u201d disrupts the reassuring mythologies of individuality.    We will use Kara Walker\u2019s notion of \u201cinner plantation\u201d as a working trope, and particularly Joan Copjec\u2019s reading of Walker\u2019s black paper cut-outs through Freud\u2019s Moses and Monotheism. The course is a guiding tour of the museum of the vicissitudes of national identity as it endures the everlasting return of the lacanian real.    It is also, and mainly, an examination of the essay, and of its practice in the Caribbean. It explores how the understanding and mutation of the legacy of modern subjectivity, as embodied in Montaigne\u2019s coinage of the genre, is \u201cdis\u201d or \u201cre\u201d-embodied by its Caribbean practitioners. It explores Adorno\u2019s view of the genre as subaltern and Barthes\u2019 practice of it as anti-mythology. Our gallery of mutants will include Pedreira\u2019s Insularismo , Lezama Lima\u2019s La expresi\u00f3n americana , Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ponte\u2019s Un seguidor de Montaigne mira La Habana , Rafael Rojas\u2019 El estante vac\u00edo , Juan Duchesne\u2019s Ciudadano insano and Eduardo Lalo\u2019s Los pa\u00edses invisibles .

PORT-GA 1104 Title: Portuguese for Spanish Speakers Instructor : Carlos Veloso Day/Time: Tuesday 6-8pm   Description: PORT-GA 1104 is an accelerated course for advanced Spanish speakers with a good command of Spanish grammar. It covers the fundamentals of the Portuguese language with a focus on Brazil. In this course, Spanish sentence patterns and vocabulary will be utilized as a basis for the study of similarities and differences between the two languages. Comparisons among sound systems (Spanish/English/Portuguese) will familiarize students with standard Portuguese pronunciation. Written responses to short readings ( cr\u00f4nicas , poetry, essays and articles) or visuals will help to review and expand grammar points and to practice transferring common features of Spanish into Portuguese syntax. Brief presentations on topics related to the arts and society will promote essential speaking skills. By the end of the semester students will be prepared to read complex materials and will have acquired basic proficiency in speaking, writing and understanding standard Portuguese.      This is a zero credit course. A limited number of spots are available for students from other departments/programs. These spots will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis. Interested students should contact Kelly Stetter at kelly.stetter@nyu.edu for permission to enroll.          PORT-GA 2968 Title: Em via de transe : Spirit Possession and Political Subjectivity in Brazil Instructor : Dylon Robbins Day/Time: Tuesday 4-6pm   Description: This course will explore notions of trance consciousness as possible enactments of political subjectivity. Examples from Brazil, along with a few complementary instances from throughout the Americas, will be examined as modes of consciousness that differ in interesting ways from more conventional models. In an effort to further contextualize trance, our discussions will address, as well, a few related phenomena, such as the relationships between listening and subjectivity, ecstasy, messianism, and populism, as well as the social exchanges involved in music\u2019s reception, production, and performance. We will read texts by M\u00e1rio de Andrade, Machado de Assis, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Wisnik, Benjamin Costallat, Jo\u00e3o do Rio, Manuel Quirino, Edison Carneiro, Nina Rodrigues, Euclides da Cunha, Glauber Rocha, Roger Bastide, Alfred M\u00e9traux, and Michael Taussig. Points of comparison will be drawn with the ideas of Suely Rolnik, Felix Guattari, Gilles Delueze, Frantz Fanon, Ernesto Laclau, Slavoj Zizek, Gilbert Rouget, Theodor Adorno, and others.        The reading for this course will be in Portuguese, English, and French. The class will be conducted in English or Portuguese depending on students\u2019 abilities. PhD students looking to fulfill the Portuguese language requirement must meet with the Instructor to discuss this option.          SPAN-GA 2965 ( View Syllabus ) Title: Photography, Set Design, and Editing in Spanish Cinema (1925-1980) Instructor : Vicente S\u00e1nchez-Biosca, Visiting Professor (University of Valencia) Day/Time: Wednesday 6:20-8:20pm   Description: La historia del cine espa\u00f1ol no se construye en solitario. Las formas f\u00edlmicas y sus soportes t\u00e9cnicos surgen en contextos internacionales, se influencian, se mimetizan, buscando, eso s\u00ed, la manera de singularizarse. Por esta raz\u00f3n, no es razonable estudiar una cinematograf\u00eda como la espa\u00f1ola sin sacar a relucir el di\u00e1logo, expl\u00edcito o impl\u00edcito, de sumisi\u00f3n o resistencia, de negociaci\u00f3n en todo caso, que mantiene con otras cinematograf\u00edas, comenzando por las m\u00e1s influyentes y modelizadoras, con Hollywood a la cabeza.      M\u00e1s precisamente, la relaci\u00f3n entre tecnolog\u00eda y estilo puede aquilatarse mejor siguiendo un triple proceso que rige la factura del cine: la direcci\u00f3n de fotograf\u00eda (sensibilidad de la pel\u00edcula, ligereza de las c\u00e1maras, captaci\u00f3n de sonido\u2026), el dise\u00f1o de producci\u00f3n (concepci\u00f3n de decorados, rodaje en interiores, construcci\u00f3n de sets, pictoricismo\u2026) y el montaje (modelos de ensamblaje visual y sonoro, figuras de sutura y de discontinuidad\u2026). En el entramado que forman estos vectores, el cine espa\u00f1ol conforma su particularidad y su diferencia, sus herencias y sus apuestas. Este curso se propone analizar, siguiendo sus complejos ajustes y desajustes, algunos momentos de cristalizaci\u00f3n y de cambio, adoptando una perspectiva decididamente comparatista con modelos transnacionales. Organizado en torno a estudios de casos, y apostando por el an\u00e1lisis minucioso de secuencias, fragmentos y planos, la selecci\u00f3n operar\u00e1 por cortes hist\u00f3ricos en los que las nociones de clasicismo, modernidad, postmodernidad aparecen ligadas a escuelas o movimientos en los que el cine espa\u00f1ol entra en conflicto y negociaci\u00f3n con otras tradiciones (vanguardia, experimentaci\u00f3n, neorrealismo, film noir , direct cinema , entre otra).      This course will be conducted in Spanish and will be open to advanced undergraduates and MFA students, with permission of the instructor. For more information, interested students should contact Kelly Stetter at kelly.stetter@nyu.edu .        SPAN-GA 2966 Title: Entre imperios: La literatura espa\u00f1ola y la(s) conciencia(s) imperial(es) Instructor : James Fern\u00e1ndez Day/Time: Thursday 4-6pm   Description: Beginning with the rhetoric of empire of Francoism, we will work our way in reverse chronological order, through a series of Spanish texts that engage the question of empire and imperialism in Spanish culture. Primary texts will include: the script and film \u201cRaza\u201d; accounts by Spaniards of the NY of the 1920s (Lorca, Moreno Villa, Camba); works generated in the context of the fourth centenary of 1892; representations of the figure of the indiano in the mid-to late nineteenth century (Gald\u00f3s, Clar\u00edn, Pardo Baz\u00e1n and others); empire and romanticism in early nineteenth-century Spain (Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda, Duque de Rivas, Larra); empire and enlightenment in the late eighteenth century (Feijoo and Cadalso).        SPAN-GA 2967 Title: Deadly Subjects: Violence, Personhood and Necropower in Modern Mexico Instructor : Juan de Dios V\u00e1zquez Day/Time: Friday 2-4pm   Description: Violence is both irrational and based on reason. It has the power to subvert identity, while inciting scientific disciplines and highly structured artistic genres that try to define both criminal subjectivity and victimhood. Violence is the soil on which an extensive series of historical changes and moral apparatuses come together. It is also at the center of the emergence of new kinds of political authority, and in the surface of multiple forms of affect, cognition, moral responsibility and action. In this course we will investigate various manifestations of violence in twentieth-century Mexico, by focusing on how practices of violence were represented and ethically and politically evaluated, but also exploring what type of subjectivities have derived by them. In order to do so, we will examine a great array of images, videos, novels, news clippings, police archives, essays, etcetera; and consider the agents that produce and are produced by this violence. Furthermore, we will study the narrative content of the representations of violence within the context of their production and use, while discussing the particular agendas they serve. By this means, we will get a better understanding of the cultural forms made to portray these brutal acts, but also the social imaginaries and the political identities that emerge from them.      This course will be conducted in Spanish.        SPAN-GA 2968 Title: Mexican Muralism and North American End of Art Instructor : Eduardo Subirats Day/Time: Wednesday 4-6pm   Description: The Mexican Mural Movement has been one of the most energizing art movements in Latin America during the past century. This seminar will focus on the three main Mexican muralists (Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera and David Alfaro Siqueiros) from the days of the Mexican Revolution to the sixties, and from the influences of European Expressionism and Cubism, to the rise of American Abstract Expressionism. The destruction of Rivera\u2019s Rockefeller center mural in 1934, the MoMA declaration of the identity modern=abstract in 1936, and the construction of an American abstract avant-garde in the late thirties marks a turning point\u2026      This course will be conducted in Spanish.          SPAN-GA 2976 ( View Syllabus ) Title: Gender Issues in Modern Spanish Writing and Film (1850s to the Present) Instructor : Jo Labanyi Day/Time: Tuesday 2-4pm   Description: The course will take students through a range of literary, essayistic, dramatic, and cinematic texts from the mid 19th century to the early 21st century, as a way of exploring a variety of critical approaches to gender. The primary aim is to develop proficiency in gender analysis as a form of cultural as well as textual criticism. Students will trace the historical development of attitudes to gender in modern Spain, both in cultural representations and in social and political discourse. The prescribed texts have been chosen to show how cultural representations can go against the dominant discourses of the historical period, as well as reflecting them. The texts also illustrate the ways in which prescribed gender roles can constrict or can be used strategically. A number of texts show how the gender divisions that have been a hallmark of western modernity are subverted by gender fluidity and/or a notion of gender as performance; other texts propose a model of sexual difference whereby women free themselves from male violence. A number of the texts explore alternatives to compulsory heterosexuality. Both masculinity and femininity will be interrogated.    The class will be taught in Spanish.          SPAN-GA 2977 Title: What's Left of Cuba? Culture, Politics, and Civil Society Instructor : Ana Dopico, Jill Lane, and Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz Day/Time: Monday 3:30-6pm   Description: Where is Cuba now in the geopolitical imaginary that once heralded Cuba as the exemplar of radical left projects in Latin America? In recent years, Cuban culture has challenged the projects of the revolution and has recast the cold war frames of embargo, exile, and exceptionalism. A new generation of writers, bloggers, visual and performance artists, and political activists and dissidents have insisted on freedom of expression, the rule of law, the politics of remembering, and the notion of civil society. Both on and off the island, many campaign \u201cfor an other Cuba\u201d (Por Otra Cuba), reclaiming the nation and challenging the state. From a burgeoning presence in social media to smaller, poignant acts of reclamation such as political tattoos and graffiti, these social actors are creating spaces of expression and action that open fissures and apertures in the discourse of the revolution and the control of the state. Although they vary in political philosophies, these new voices demand both universality and contingency: an agenda that mixes the politics of human rights, Cuban values, and the unfinished projects of both the republic and the revolution. In this seminar we explore this complex political formation and the new social subjects that it makes possible. We engage visual and performance art, photography, social media, cr\u00f3nica, music, video, film, and activism, including the work of Antonio Jose Ponte, the bloggers Yoani Sanch\u00e9z and Orlando Pardo Lazo, the internet sites Desde Cuba and Estado de Sats, and artists El Sexto, Omni Zona Franca, Coco Fusco, and Tania Bruguera, among others. As an interdisciplinary seminar organized by the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the seminar is accompanied by a bi-weekly guest lecture series, held on Monday evenings.        SPAN-GA 2978 Title: Mutant Essays: Post-nationalism in the Caribbean Instructor : Rub\u00e9n R\u00edos \u00c1vila Day/Time: Wednesday 6-8pm   Description: This course examines the trials and tribulations of identity as the coagulating agent behind national and ethnic epiphanies of the Caribbean. Correspondingly, it takes a close look at the counter politics of erasure, (of a national or ethnic \u201cgiven\u201d) and how it operates as a poetics of deflation, where more diffuse, rhizomatic metaphors like the plantation, the diaspora, the archipelago, or the estuary, put to task the autonomy of the island as an empowering archetype for the stability of both the national and individual subject. Benitez Rojo\u2019s \u201cisla que se repite\u201d and Edouard Glissant\u2019s \u201cpo\u00e9tique de la relation\u201d provide key elements for this politics (and rhetoric) of disidentification, where the plantation hovers as a living dead, as a haunting economic corpse, and \u201crelation\u201d disrupts the reassuring mythologies of individuality.    We will use Kara Walker\u2019s notion of \u201cinner plantation\u201d as a working trope, and particularly Joan Copjec\u2019s reading of Walker\u2019s black paper cut-outs through Freud\u2019s Moses and Monotheism. The course is a guiding tour of the museum of the vicissitudes of national identity as it endures the everlasting return of the lacanian real.    It is also, and mainly, an examination of the essay, and of its practice in the Caribbean. It explores how the understanding and mutation of the legacy of modern subjectivity, as embodied in Montaigne\u2019s coinage of the genre, is \u201cdis\u201d or \u201cre\u201d-embodied by its Caribbean practitioners. It explores Adorno\u2019s view of the genre as subaltern and Barthes\u2019 practice of it as anti-mythology. Our gallery of mutants will include Pedreira\u2019s Insularismo , Lezama Lima\u2019s La expresi\u00f3n americana , Antonio Jos\u00e9 Ponte\u2019s Un seguidor de Montaigne mira La Habana , Rafael Rojas\u2019 El estante vac\u00edo , Juan Duchesne\u2019s Ciudadano insano and Eduardo Lalo\u2019s Los pa\u00edses invisibles .    This course will be conducted in Spanish.
