The Violet mascot, clad in a skintight, green body suit     with arms in the shape of green violet leaves, a necklace of large purple     petals and a purple face with yellow hair was instituted in 1983, only     to be replaced in 1984. After the University rejected suggestions including     Vikings, Vanguards, and Victors, it adopted the BobCat from the character     that symbolized the new computer catalog in Bobst Library. It represents     the strong link between academic and athletic excellence at NYU.               &lt;    Previous    Next    &gt;"}]}]
