We have made major strides towards fulfilling this mission: our research, clinical, educational, and community services have expanded and grown in new directions. In the face of increased threats to our security and safety, our work has highlighted the importance of strengthening resilience in all children as a preventive strategy to enhance and protect their psychological well-being.   Although our efforts are making a difference, significant challenges remain. Research shows that over 75 percent of mental health disorders have their roots in the childhood and adolescent years, though fewer than one quarter of children or adolescents needing services receive treatment. Millions of children are never properly diagnosed or treated. In the coming year, we will continue to work for increased awareness of child mental health issues, new knowledge, new treatments, and better care to help give children back their childhood.
