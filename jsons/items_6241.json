This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting.

Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets.

Asad is strongly motivated by his Muslim faith, and has founded a nonprofit organization called 'Muslims Giving Back,' which aims to empower needy families throughout the New York area by providing them with basic essentials they need to get them back on their feet. His favorite hobbies include reading, writing, and public speaking. Currently, Asad is working as a Conflict Resolution Intern at the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding and as a Social Work Intern at Make the Road New York.

She's thrilled to be working with the Auburn Theological Seminary, researching mindfulness and social justice.

Jordan also serves on leadership for InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, is Treasurer for the Christian Inter-Fellowship Council, a member of the Multifaith Advisory Council, and is a co-founder and co-President of MuCh (Muslim-Christian Dialogue).                                                 Brian is currently a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences, where he intends to major in Metropolitan Studies.

It was here that he originally became involved in spiritual life through his work in the Campus Ministry program, where he assisted in planning events and led a retreat towards the end of his high school years. Though he does not subscribe himself to any particular religion or philosophy at this point in time, he hopes to use the experience he has to help promote interfaith cooperation and the practice of mindfulness through his work in NYU\u2019s Office of Global Spiritual Life.

NYU students reflect this diversity; they arrive from all over the country and the world not only to find themselves and \u201cmake it\u201d here, but to teach\u2014and learn from\u2014each other (not to mention build amazing friendships along the way). This makes student life at NYU a remarkable, life-changing experience unlike that at many other colleges.           Students at NYU are in the unique position to experience a college lifestyle in a city setting. NYU offers many of the essential activities that are traditionally associated with college student life, and its location in the heart of New York City creates a setting that presents a myriad of non-traditional opportunities that will supplement and accentuate the student life experience.     While here, students can join a fraternity or sorority. They can join one of our sports teams: NYU athletics range from intramural soccer to varsity fencing. They can develop and engage in a diverse, personal spiritual life. Academy Award winning directors and prize winning writers have honed their craft in NYU classrooms. Students can follow in their footsteps, exploring radio, film and the printed word by contributing to or joining one of the University\u2019s student media outlets. From Washington Square News to WNYU Radio to Tisch film courses, NYU students take advantage of New York City as a global center for media, journalism and communications.

Students can live in residential housing near the Washington Square campus\u2014soaking in the vibrant Greenwich Village neighborhood\u2014or they can live off campus in one of the five boroughs and beyond. With either option, students aren\u2019t just residents of a college campus; they are citizens, users and a vital aspect of one of the world\u2019s largest, diverse, most interesting cities.     As members of a metropolitan community, NYU students have access to the University\u2019s greatest resource: New York City itself. They use the city to launch a great career. Students intern for the world\u2019s most influential companies, biggest media outlets and largest organizations. They network with some of the most powerful people in the city, the country and the globe. Students also get involved in the community, volunteering or working for one of the city\u2019s many charities or even starting community service organizations of their own. That\u2019s just one example of how students take leadership positions that prepare them for what lies ahead after college.          NYU is \"in and of the city,\" and now with its growing global presence, in and of the world. Student Life at NYU reflects this. An NYU education is an experience like no other: diverse, cosmopolitan, vibrant and rich. NYU students do not just become well-rounded college graduates, but accomplished global citizens.

This trailblazing program will actively equip students \u2014 the next generation of leaders \u2014 with a deep and thorough understanding of how multifaith work and mindfulness can be incorporated into every aspect of their lives.   The Fellowship will involve two components: internship placements at partnering institutions and discussion-based learning sessions coordinated by Global Spiritual Life at NYU.

Asad is strongly motivated by his Muslim faith, and has founded a nonprofit organization called 'Muslims Giving Back,' which aims to empower needy families throughout the New York area by providing them with basic essentials they need to get them back on their feet. His favorite hobbies include reading, writing, and public speaking. Currently, Asad is working as a Conflict Resolution Intern at the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding and as a Social Work Intern at Make the Road New York.

You can find her obsessing over characters from Scandal, Grey's Anatomy, and Friends, while enjoying comfort food from her favorite cuisines.

She has since sought out further mindfulness opportunities such as a meditative retreat while abroad in England at Bhaktivedanta Manor, donated by George Harrison to be a home for the International Hare Krishna Society. Last summer, she blogged for the Center for Spiritual Life about her experience in teaching mindfulness to her mom. She's thrilled to be working with the Auburn Theological Seminary, researching mindfulness and social justice.
