An \u201cacademic partnership\u201d indicates that a department or school has a significant scholarly and curricular stake in a given global site, currently offers or is developing coursework there (also known as \u201ccurricular pathways\u201d), and is willing to take an active role in determining the site\u2019s academic direction through participation on the Site-Specific Advisory Committee. An &quot;academic affiliation&quot; with a global site means that a department or school currently offers or plans to offer at least one course at that site; these may be courses that are required for multiple majors or for general education programs. This is an important relationship, as each department or school with an affiliation will sponsor coursework in a global site. An affiliation may give rise to occasional participation on a Site-Specific Advisory Committee.   Department or schools that are interested in pursuing either a partnership or an affiliation with a global site should contact their dean and/or department chair where discussions regarding academic partnerships and affiliations are held.

As part of the program, students choose from Africana studies courses at SOAS and Africana studies courses at NYU in London. Courses available at SOAS include African Language Literatures, Culture in Africa, Contemporary African Literature, Language in Africa, and Perspectives on African Experience . (Please note that SOAS courses outside of this selection are not open to NYU in London students, and students on the NYU in London cannot enroll directly in University of London courses.) Africana Studies courses at NYU in London include Introduction to Black Urban Studies and Introduction to Pan Africanism .                    Madrid, Spain (Year or Spring Only)                                                  Universidad Autonoma de Madrid                                  While students may take all their course requirements at the NYU Madrid academic center, in the spring semester students may opt to take a course at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). One of the most prestigious universities in Spain, the UAM is located approximately 25 minutes by train from NYU Madrid center and boasts a modern, attractive campus.   Students who enroll in courses at UAM are expected to have an excellent command of the Spanish language, and their course selection must be arranged and approved by the NYU Madrid staff. As the spring semester at the UAM runs from mid-February to the end of May, with final exams taking place in June any student considering taking a course at the UAM should not plan on leaving Spain until the end of June.                      Paris, France                                                  The University of Paris  Universities (Paris I, III, VII, X),Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur                                  Founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne became the center of theological studies. The Sorbonne was closed in 1790, and its buildings became part of the University of Paris in 1808. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the University of Paris expanded both academically (beyond the study of theology) and physically (beyond its original location in the Latin Quarter). In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities located in and around Paris.   Since that division, the system has grown to include 13 different universities, and the Sorbonne has become a complex of buildings serving the needs of these universities.   During the academic year NYU Paris has a formal student exchange arrangement between NYU Paris and the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot). The arrangement permits NYU in Paris students to obtain university student cards and to have a large choice of courses. Students may also take courses at other Universities (Paris I, III, X) or specialized institutions such as the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur. Students enrolled in the French university system attend classes with native speakers of French. Advanced students in Program II typically take one course in the French university system and the rest of their courses at the NYU center.   Registration for French university courses takes place at the Paris center, upon your arrival in France in consultation with the NYU Paris staff. Areas of interest to NYU students and in which these universities excel include literature, history, language methodology and phonetics, cinema, political science, anthropology, and art history. Students\u2019 work is supervised and evaluated in tutorial sessions with NYU faculty members and the Paris director.

An \u201cacademic partnership\u201d indicates that a department or school has a significant scholarly and curricular stake in a given global site, currently offers or is developing coursework there (also known as \u201ccurricular pathways\u201d), and is willing to take an active role in determining the site\u2019s academic direction through participation on the Site-Specific Advisory Committee. An &quot;academic affiliation&quot; with a global site means that a department or school currently offers or plans to offer at least one course at that site; these may be courses that are required for multiple majors or for general education programs. This is an important relationship, as each department or school with an affiliation will sponsor coursework in a global site. An affiliation may give rise to occasional participation on a Site-Specific Advisory Committee.   Department or schools that are interested in pursuing either a partnership or an affiliation with a global site should contact their dean and/or department chair where discussions regarding academic partnerships and affiliations are held.

Law: Undergraduate students interested in Law can apply through the Office of Study Abroad Admissions for the Certificate program in Law. NYU School of Law students must apply for the exchange through the Global Law School. Additional information regarding this program can be found on the NYU Global Law School Website .   Dutch Langauge Courses: The Institute for Dutch as a Second Language (INTT) of the UvA offers extensive courses for an extra fee to foreign students each semester at absolute beginners, beginners, intermediate and advanced levels. For more information email: intt@hum.uva.nl .   Course List: For an updated list of courses at UvA, please refer to the UvA website .   Languages of Instruction: English or Dutch. Proficiency required for courses taught in Dutch.   Academic Calendar: The academic year at UvA is divided into two semesters of 18 - 21 weeks each. NYU students may apply to study for a full academic year or single semester.   Fall Term: Early September - December/January  Spring Term: Early February - Late June   To view the current calendar on line, please click here .   Credits: At UvA a full-time course load is 30 ECTS (European Credits) per semester. The number of courses a student takes will vary, depending on the credit rating of each course. A typical course load is three courses of 10 ECTS each. Thirty ECTS credits is equivalent to approximately 16 NYU credits; the final determination of credit awards is made by the Dean of the student\u2019s school at NYU.   Admissions Criteria: Undergraduate students must have completed at least 64 points of academic work and graduate students must have successfully completed the first year of a masters or doctoral program. All students must be in good academic standing (3.0 GPA), and possess demonstrated language proficiency (if applicable).   Application Materials: NYU Student Data Form , academic planning form , official NYU transcript, results of language proficiency test (if applicable), statement of purpose, resume/CV, and two letters of academic recommendation.   Upon a successful review of the application materials, students will be invited to complete a UvA application form.   Application Process: NYU students must receive approval from advisors in their schools and from their departments to participate in the exchange program. Completed applications should be submitted to the Office of Global Programs, 110 East 14th Street, Lower Level by February 15th for the academic year and by September 15th for the spring semester.   Housing: As the University of Amsterdam does not have a campus per se, student residences are scattered throughout the city. Rooms are furnished, and sheets and kitchen equipment can be rented. There is a housing deposit fee (approximately $425), an administrative fee (approximately $15). Some students prefer to rent private apartments by themselves or with roommates. Rent for a single room in Amsterdam varies from approximately \u20ac350 to \u20ac700 per month.   Since there is a shortage of rooms in Amsterdam, very strict regulations on the reservation of rooms have been made by the University of Amsterdam. The Universiteit van Amsterdam will do their utmost to arrange housing for exchange students. For more information on housing, please click here .   Other Expenses: In addition to housing costs, students should expect to spend \u20ac400 to \u20ac600 per month on other living expenses.

London, England                                                  University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS)                               NYU in London is delighted to continue its partnership with the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), one of the world's preeminent centers for research in African studies. This exciting program is open to both NYU and non-NYU students during the fall term only and allows students to immerse themselves in academic life at a specialized British institution while taking course work at the NYU in London Center. As part of the program, students choose from Africana studies courses at SOAS and Africana studies courses at NYU in London. Courses available at SOAS include African Language Literatures, Culture in Africa, Contemporary African Literature, Language in Africa, and Perspectives on African Experience . (Please note that SOAS courses outside of this selection are not open to NYU in London students, and students on the NYU in London cannot enroll directly in University of London courses.) Africana Studies courses at NYU in London include Introduction to Black Urban Studies and Introduction to Pan Africanism .                    Madrid, Spain (Year or Spring Only)                                                  Universidad Autonoma de Madrid                                  While students may take all their course requirements at the NYU Madrid academic center, in the spring semester students may opt to take a course at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid (UAM). One of the most prestigious universities in Spain, the UAM is located approximately 25 minutes by train from NYU Madrid center and boasts a modern, attractive campus.   Students who enroll in courses at UAM are expected to have an excellent command of the Spanish language, and their course selection must be arranged and approved by the NYU Madrid staff. As the spring semester at the UAM runs from mid-February to the end of May, with final exams taking place in June any student considering taking a course at the UAM should not plan on leaving Spain until the end of June.                      Paris, France                                                  The University of Paris  Universities (Paris I, III, VII, X),Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur                                  Founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne became the center of theological studies. The Sorbonne was closed in 1790, and its buildings became part of the University of Paris in 1808. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the University of Paris expanded both academically (beyond the study of theology) and physically (beyond its original location in the Latin Quarter). In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities located in and around Paris.   Since that division, the system has grown to include 13 different universities, and the Sorbonne has become a complex of buildings serving the needs of these universities.   During the academic year NYU Paris has a formal student exchange arrangement between NYU Paris and the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot). The arrangement permits NYU in Paris students to obtain university student cards and to have a large choice of courses. Students may also take courses at other Universities (Paris I, III, X) or specialized institutions such as the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur. Students enrolled in the French university system attend classes with native speakers of French. Advanced students in Program II typically take one course in the French university system and the rest of their courses at the NYU center.   Registration for French university courses takes place at the Paris center, upon your arrival in France in consultation with the NYU Paris staff. Areas of interest to NYU students and in which these universities excel include literature, history, language methodology and phonetics, cinema, political science, anthropology, and art history. Students\u2019 work is supervised and evaluated in tutorial sessions with NYU faculty members and the Paris director.

An \u201cacademic partnership\u201d indicates that a department or school has a significant scholarly and curricular stake in a given global site, currently offers or is developing coursework there (also known as \u201ccurricular pathways\u201d), and is willing to take an active role in determining the site\u2019s academic direction through participation on the Site-Specific Advisory Committee. An &quot;academic affiliation&quot; with a global site means that a department or school currently offers or plans to offer at least one course at that site; these may be courses that are required for multiple majors or for general education programs. This is an important relationship, as each department or school with an affiliation will sponsor coursework in a global site. An affiliation may give rise to occasional participation on a Site-Specific Advisory Committee.   Department or schools that are interested in pursuing either a partnership or an affiliation with a global site should contact their dean and/or department chair where discussions regarding academic partnerships and affiliations are held.

Paris, France                                                  The University of Paris  Universities (Paris I, III, VII, X),Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur                                  Founded in 1257 by the theologian and chaplain of Saint Louis, Robert de Sorbon, the Coll\u00e8ge de la Sorbonne became the center of theological studies. The Sorbonne was closed in 1790, and its buildings became part of the University of Paris in 1808. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the University of Paris expanded both academically (beyond the study of theology) and physically (beyond its original location in the Latin Quarter). In 1968, the University of Paris was divided into three independent entities located in and around Paris.   Since that division, the system has grown to include 13 different universities, and the Sorbonne has become a complex of buildings serving the needs of these universities.   During the academic year NYU Paris has a formal student exchange arrangement between NYU Paris and the University of Paris VII (Denis Diderot). The arrangement permits NYU in Paris students to obtain university student cards and to have a large choice of courses. Students may also take courses at other Universities (Paris I, III, X) or specialized institutions such as the Institut d'\u00c9tudes Politiques, and Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieur. Students enrolled in the French university system attend classes with native speakers of French. Advanced students in Program II typically take one course in the French university system and the rest of their courses at the NYU center.   Registration for French university courses takes place at the Paris center, upon your arrival in France in consultation with the NYU Paris staff. Areas of interest to NYU students and in which these universities excel include literature, history, language methodology and phonetics, cinema, political science, anthropology, and art history. Students\u2019 work is supervised and evaluated in tutorial sessions with NYU faculty members and the Paris director.
