Research opportunities in microbiology include the study of the environmental effects caused by genetically engineered microorganisms. Studies in immunology range from innate to specific immunity, with specific research projects that examine tobacco-mediated changes in expression of Class I MHC molecules and the role of gamma-delta T cells in oral diseases. Other projects include the study of inflammatory responses to viral infections, regulation of the blood brain barrier, neuroimmunology, and immunological interactions between tumors and host tissues. The ultimate goal of much of this research is to design novel modalities for the treatment of viral infections and cancer.
