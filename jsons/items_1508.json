The course gives due attention to other relevant figures, such as Gokhale, Tilak, Jinnah, and Nehru in the case of India; Li Hongzhang, Sun Yatsen, Chen Duxiu, La Dazhao, and Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; and Phan Boi Chau in the case of Vietnam.    Seminar: Cold War in Asia   EAST-UA 552 Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) are the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H.

Cultures of National Division: The Koreas and Others   EAST-UA 567 4 points.   Asks how the fact of national division, as the founding moment of the postwar Korean states, has affected the way that national life is lived and narrated. It examines the myriad ways in which division has been formulated in literature, film, historiography, and popular discourse. Topics covered include gendered tropes of division, imagined reunifications, and division in the global culture industry. The main focus is on the two Koreas, but also looks comparatively and historically at the experiences of East/West Germany and India/Pakistan.    History of Modern Korea   EAST-UA 609 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Starting in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345), national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.    Korean Modernism   EAST-UA 610 4 points.   Considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular.

Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 613 Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.    Japanese Cinema in the International Context   EAST-UA 614 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Studies Japanese cinema from a comparative perspective, examining the interactions between Japanese and non-Japanese film authors. Cross-cultural interactions, translations, and creative \"misunderstandings\" are analyzed by comparing films from a variety of national cinemas, historical periods, and genres.

Aesthetics and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan   EAST-UA 615 Looser. 4 points.   Offers a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives.    New Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 616 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Focuses on Japanese cinema from 1989 to the present, or the so-called \"new Japanese cinema.\" Major questions considered include why Japanese cinema has succeeded in reinventing itself after 20 years of hiatus; how the resurgence of genres such as yakuza movies and J-horror has contributed to the reinvention; who are some of the major players of the new cinema; what specific roles socioeconomic conditions have played in the radical transformation of Japanese cinema; and how globalization is fundamentally affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of films in Japan now. Students closely watch and analyze films by Takeshi Kitano, Takashi Miike, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinji Aoyama, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Hideo Nakata, Takashi Shimizu, and other directors.    Approaches to Chinese Cinema   EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points.   The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.    Mass Culture: Japan   EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.    Japanese Animation and New Media   EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered.    Anime   EAST-UA 709 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Introduces students to the rich world of Japanese animation or anime, its form and style, history, popular genres and themes, major authors, and fan culture. Explores the popularity of anime in relation to the cultural conditions of contemporary Japan and that of the world.    Topics in Japanese Literature   EAST-UA 719 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II   EAST-UA 721 4 points.   Exposes students to some of the most provocative and entertaining novels written in Japanese since the end of the Second World War. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic.

Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper.    Vietnam: Its History   EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

We examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia's place in \"a New World Order\"; and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we examine key declassified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy.    Cultures of National Division: The Koreas and Others   EAST-UA 567 4 points.   Asks how the fact of national division, as the founding moment of the postwar Korean states, has affected the way that national life is lived and narrated. It examines the myriad ways in which division has been formulated in literature, film, historiography, and popular discourse. Topics covered include gendered tropes of division, imagined reunifications, and division in the global culture industry. The main focus is on the two Koreas, but also looks comparatively and historically at the experiences of East/West Germany and India/Pakistan.    History of Modern Korea   EAST-UA 609 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Starting in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345), national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.    Korean Modernism   EAST-UA 610 4 points.   Considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular. Through intensive reading of works from 1920s and 1930s Korea, students obtain an idea of the parameters of modern Korean literature and of the main issues involved in the discussion of modernity in Korea.    20th-Century Korean Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 611 4 points.   Provides an overview of 20th-century Korean literature, tracing its development under the competing influences of tradition, history, and the West. Readings include drama, poetry, and fiction from modern and contemporary periods. Includes occasional lectures on classical forms of Korean literature and drama.    Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 613 Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.    Japanese Cinema in the International Context   EAST-UA 614 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Studies Japanese cinema from a comparative perspective, examining the interactions between Japanese and non-Japanese film authors. Cross-cultural interactions, translations, and creative \"misunderstandings\" are analyzed by comparing films from a variety of national cinemas, historical periods, and genres. Some directors studied are Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Takeshi Kitano, Kenji Mizoguchi, Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, the Wachowski brothers, Hou Hsiao-hsien, and John Ford.    Aesthetics and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan   EAST-UA 615 Looser. 4 points.   Offers a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives.    New Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 616 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Focuses on Japanese cinema from 1989 to the present, or the so-called \"new Japanese cinema.\" Major questions considered include why Japanese cinema has succeeded in reinventing itself after 20 years of hiatus; how the resurgence of genres such as yakuza movies and J-horror has contributed to the reinvention; who are some of the major players of the new cinema; what specific roles socioeconomic conditions have played in the radical transformation of Japanese cinema; and how globalization is fundamentally affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of films in Japan now. Students closely watch and analyze films by Takeshi Kitano, Takashi Miike, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinji Aoyama, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Hideo Nakata, Takashi Shimizu, and other directors.    Approaches to Chinese Cinema   EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points.   The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.    Mass Culture: Japan   EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.    Japanese Animation and New Media   EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered.    Anime   EAST-UA 709 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Introduces students to the rich world of Japanese animation or anime, its form and style, history, popular genres and themes, major authors, and fan culture. Explores the popularity of anime in relation to the cultural conditions of contemporary Japan and that of the world.    Topics in Japanese Literature   EAST-UA 719 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II   EAST-UA 721 4 points.   Exposes students to some of the most provocative and entertaining novels written in Japanese since the end of the Second World War. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper.    Vietnam: Its History   EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.
