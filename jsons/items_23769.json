Along with the studio classes, students will have the opportunity to meet and have their work critiqued by contemporary artists. This program is free of charge . The Visionary Studio ( scheduled on 4 of the Saturdays, TBD ) part of the program brings in working artists to lecture about their work and critique projects done in the classroom. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions and acquire more in depth knowledge of what it means to be an artist in the modern age.    On the final day of the program, we will bring in several artists and Steinhardt alumni for a final critique of the work done during the entire program. The following day, we will have a one-day final exhibition of the work in the art building, opened to all family and friends. During the exhibition, all work will be documented for the students and given to them for their final portfolio.    With these workshops we aim to not only help teenagers find their voices through art, but also in everyday life. As part of the class, each student presents his/her own work, thus affording the opportunity to hone communication and presentation skills. We feel that this part of the program helps to develop skills, which can be useful in preparation for college, and ultimately outside the classroom. High school students must apply with a portfolio of work to be admitted to the Advanced Workshop.    Spring 2015 Advanced Art Workshop    The next workshops will be offered on nine Saturdays this spring from 9:30am-12:30pm:    2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2, 5/9 Plus Sunday 5/10, Final Exhibition &amp; Reception *Visionary Studio lecture series will meet from 1:00-3:00pm on dates TBD. If accepted to participate, attendance in all of these dates is mandatory.    Advanced Art Workshop Descriptions    Sculpture In this class, students will learn two different ways of making sculpture. The first half of this course will engage students in the basic processes of moldmaking with plaster and clay. You will cast objects of their choosing using press molding and slip casting, and have the option of firing their work. The second half of this course will focus on soft sculpture as a medium, using various types of textiles. Technical skills such as machine and hand sewing, grommetting, and basic pattern making will be covered. Students will use these skills to respond to basic sculptural prompts. Additionally, students will participate in class critiques of their projects. Brief lectures will be given on contemporary sculpture.    Experimental Painting This class, as opposed to the traditional introductory classes in painting which usually focus on basic technique, will take a more modern approach to painting and focus on what we as contemporary viewers value from painting today. The goal is not to dismiss technique (for it is obviously very important) but to expose younger students who might not otherwise have the chance, to what it means to be a painter today. Experimentation will be key, not for its own sake, but for the rewards that will arise from trial and error.    Photo/Digital Art This course will include an introduction to several techniques in creating digital artwork. Students will learn basic skills in image and video editing software, which will provide the basis for completing several class projects, as well as discuss how digital techniques can be useful in creating traditional works. The class will begin by looking at digital photography/collage and progress into video and the moving image. Further, we will be looking at a number of contemporary and modern artists working in the field as a means of contextualizing work completed in the class.

Saturday mornings, from 10am-12pm, teens research one of four significant social themes (such as imagining the human body, street art, power and the symbol of the fist, and the water crisis) and discover a rich array of innovative, multidisciplinary approaches through which they can visually express their ideas.    Classes are taught by teams of graduate students completing their Certification in Art Education program at New York University. Together, students and teachers consider ways in which artists can and do influence society, and experiment with techniques that include drawing, painting, printmaking, video, photography, 3-dimensional media, and installation. These workshops challenge students to think outside of traditional artistic media and explore how artistic boundaries and influence can be stretched to include what has historically been excluded. As part of the program students participate in a final exhibition inviting a wide audience of parents, friends, teachers, and NYU faculty, to see their work. High School students do not need a portfolio to apply to the Saturday Art Workshop - classes are free-of-charge, and open to students with all levels of art experience! Curriculum Archive: Fall 2013 Fall 2012 Fall 2011 Fall 2010     Fall 2014 Visionary Studio Themes: Saturday Art Workshop Curriculum    Waste Not, Want Not Consumption and waste are part of our everyday lives. As a culture we produce much that we throw away, from household garbage to toxic industrial waste. Increasingly, technological waste is becoming commonplace as we upgrade our computers and other digital equipment. Since the energy crisis in 1973 the term recycling has become part of our understanding of waste. Where does our garbage go? Artists have responded to the topic in a variety of ways - by making art with recycled materials, visually documenting what happens to toxic waste, as well as raising awareness about the labor that goes behind waste management. This class will look at waste from different social, cultural and political perspectives while giving students a chance to make artwork in a variety of media. Students will each make a final work for exhibition that reflects on the concept of waste from a personal perspective. It&rsquo;s How You Say It Many visual artists play with words and language. In their work, artists explore how we learn about the world we live in and ourselves by combining visual images and text in different ways. Many visual artists experiment with language to create new ways we read or make meaning with text and image. Others play with media forms that combine image and text, such as books, visual poetry, alphabets, or advertising. Increasingly, artists are using text and image or only text to open dialogue about pertinent issues in our world. In this class, students will have a chance to see how artists play with language in a variety of ways and experiment with different forms of art that include text and language. In a culminating work for the exhibition, students will generate their own statement about the world using image and text while experimenting with different art forms such as bookmaking or advertising. Superheroes What if we had special powers that allowed us to do super-human things? What powers and possibilities have superheroes in cartoons and comic strips represented over time and how have they wielded their powers to do good or evil in the world? The superheroes we create can tell us about how we want to be in the world, but also about the problems and concerns of our society. Artist activist have used superheroes to speak about social concerns in communities and world. This class explores how artists, graphic novelists and activists have created a cast of superheroes that reflect real and imagined situations and the ways that we can change the situations to make a better world . Put it on Repeat From vinyl record covers to music videos, artists have worked with music as both subject and medium. How have artists translated sound in visual ways, and helped us see our music with fresh eyes and ears? How has technology influenced the way we make, listen to, and appreciate music and given artists new ways to help us hear and see music and sound? Artists have also used sound to address pressing issues in our society and world from issues of freedom of speech to terrorism. In this class, students will look at a range of artists who work with sound in contemporary ways, and experiment with new ways to make visual art with sound. Self-Portraits: From Rock Paintings to Selfies The selfie is the most common form of picture taking today. We all use our phones and cameras to document who we are and where we&rsquo;ve been. The self-portrait is the oldest form of art - from the first cave paintings to Facebook - humans like to make pictures of themselves! Contemporary artists have used the self portraits to address issues related to cultural identity and politics. How and why do we define ourselves through self-portraits? How and why do artists present themselves in their artwork? This class will look at the diverse ways artists address both personal and social, cultural, and political issues using self-portraits. Students will be able to explore what self-portraits mean to them in today&rsquo;s world.

Along with the studio classes, students will have the opportunity to meet and have their work critiqued by contemporary artists. This program is free of charge . The Visionary Studio ( scheduled on 4 of the Saturdays, TBD ) part of the program brings in working artists to lecture about their work and critique projects done in the classroom. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions and acquire more in depth knowledge of what it means to be an artist in the modern age.    On the final day of the program, we will bring in several artists and Steinhardt alumni for a final critique of the work done during the entire program. The following day, we will have a one-day final exhibition of the work in the art building, opened to all family and friends. During the exhibition, all work will be documented for the students and given to them for their final portfolio.    With these workshops we aim to not only help teenagers find their voices through art, but also in everyday life. As part of the class, each student presents his/her own work, thus affording the opportunity to hone communication and presentation skills. We feel that this part of the program helps to develop skills, which can be useful in preparation for college, and ultimately outside the classroom. High school students must apply with a portfolio of work to be admitted to the Advanced Workshop.    Spring 2015 Advanced Art Workshop    The next workshops will be offered on nine Saturdays this spring from 9:30am-12:30pm:    2/28, 3/7, 3/14, 3/21, 3/28, 4/18, 4/25, 5/2, 5/9 Plus Sunday 5/10, Final Exhibition &amp; Reception *Visionary Studio lecture series will meet from 1:00-3:00pm on dates TBD. If accepted to participate, attendance in all of these dates is mandatory.    Advanced Art Workshop Descriptions    Sculpture In this class, students will learn two different ways of making sculpture. The first half of this course will engage students in the basic processes of moldmaking with plaster and clay. You will cast objects of their choosing using press molding and slip casting, and have the option of firing their work. The second half of this course will focus on soft sculpture as a medium, using various types of textiles. Technical skills such as machine and hand sewing, grommetting, and basic pattern making will be covered. Students will use these skills to respond to basic sculptural prompts. Additionally, students will participate in class critiques of their projects. Brief lectures will be given on contemporary sculpture.    Experimental Painting This class, as opposed to the traditional introductory classes in painting which usually focus on basic technique, will take a more modern approach to painting and focus on what we as contemporary viewers value from painting today. The goal is not to dismiss technique (for it is obviously very important) but to expose younger students who might not otherwise have the chance, to what it means to be a painter today. Experimentation will be key, not for its own sake, but for the rewards that will arise from trial and error.    Photo/Digital Art This course will include an introduction to several techniques in creating digital artwork. Students will learn basic skills in image and video editing software, which will provide the basis for completing several class projects, as well as discuss how digital techniques can be useful in creating traditional works. The class will begin by looking at digital photography/collage and progress into video and the moving image. Further, we will be looking at a number of contemporary and modern artists working in the field as a means of contextualizing work completed in the class.

Saturday mornings, from 10am-12pm, teens research one of four significant social themes (such as imagining the human body, street art, power and the symbol of the fist, and the water crisis) and discover a rich array of innovative, multidisciplinary approaches through which they can visually express their ideas.    Classes are taught by teams of graduate students completing their Certification in Art Education program at New York University. Together, students and teachers consider ways in which artists can and do influence society, and experiment with techniques that include drawing, painting, printmaking, video, photography, 3-dimensional media, and installation. These workshops challenge students to think outside of traditional artistic media and explore how artistic boundaries and influence can be stretched to include what has historically been excluded. As part of the program students participate in a final exhibition inviting a wide audience of parents, friends, teachers, and NYU faculty, to see their work. High School students do not need a portfolio to apply to the Saturday Art Workshop - classes are free-of-charge, and open to students with all levels of art experience! Curriculum Archive: Fall 2013 Fall 2012 Fall 2011 Fall 2010     Fall 2014 Visionary Studio Themes: Saturday Art Workshop Curriculum    Waste Not, Want Not Consumption and waste are part of our everyday lives. As a culture we produce much that we throw away, from household garbage to toxic industrial waste. Increasingly, technological waste is becoming commonplace as we upgrade our computers and other digital equipment. Since the energy crisis in 1973 the term recycling has become part of our understanding of waste. Where does our garbage go? Artists have responded to the topic in a variety of ways - by making art with recycled materials, visually documenting what happens to toxic waste, as well as raising awareness about the labor that goes behind waste management. This class will look at waste from different social, cultural and political perspectives while giving students a chance to make artwork in a variety of media. Students will each make a final work for exhibition that reflects on the concept of waste from a personal perspective. It&rsquo;s How You Say It Many visual artists play with words and language. In their work, artists explore how we learn about the world we live in and ourselves by combining visual images and text in different ways. Many visual artists experiment with language to create new ways we read or make meaning with text and image. Others play with media forms that combine image and text, such as books, visual poetry, alphabets, or advertising. Increasingly, artists are using text and image or only text to open dialogue about pertinent issues in our world. In this class, students will have a chance to see how artists play with language in a variety of ways and experiment with different forms of art that include text and language. In a culminating work for the exhibition, students will generate their own statement about the world using image and text while experimenting with different art forms such as bookmaking or advertising. Superheroes What if we had special powers that allowed us to do super-human things? What powers and possibilities have superheroes in cartoons and comic strips represented over time and how have they wielded their powers to do good or evil in the world? The superheroes we create can tell us about how we want to be in the world, but also about the problems and concerns of our society. Artist activist have used superheroes to speak about social concerns in communities and world. This class explores how artists, graphic novelists and activists have created a cast of superheroes that reflect real and imagined situations and the ways that we can change the situations to make a better world . Put it on Repeat From vinyl record covers to music videos, artists have worked with music as both subject and medium. How have artists translated sound in visual ways, and helped us see our music with fresh eyes and ears? How has technology influenced the way we make, listen to, and appreciate music and given artists new ways to help us hear and see music and sound? Artists have also used sound to address pressing issues in our society and world from issues of freedom of speech to terrorism. In this class, students will look at a range of artists who work with sound in contemporary ways, and experiment with new ways to make visual art with sound. Self-Portraits: From Rock Paintings to Selfies The selfie is the most common form of picture taking today. We all use our phones and cameras to document who we are and where we&rsquo;ve been. The self-portrait is the oldest form of art - from the first cave paintings to Facebook - humans like to make pictures of themselves! Contemporary artists have used the self portraits to address issues related to cultural identity and politics. How and why do we define ourselves through self-portraits? How and why do artists present themselves in their artwork? This class will look at the diverse ways artists address both personal and social, cultural, and political issues using self-portraits.
