Typically, a student taking a CORE production is involved in every aspect of creating a project - the scriptwriting, producing, directing, shooting, and editing. (A \"Craft\" course, by comparison, concentrates on only one aspect of the project creation as just the directing, just the producing, just the editing, etc.)    All courses are arranged by subject areas and by level: Introductory, Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advanced. Some courses may not be offered in a given academic year. Consult each semester\u2019s schedule for specific information.    Students must complete 4 Core Production courses for a minimum of 20 points. However, only one CORE production course may be taken each semester due to the strenuous nature of these courses.

It is strongly recommended that you enroll in Post-Production Colloquium, H56.0060, 1 credit, in the same semester that you enroll in any intermediate-level core production course.    Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop is a practical course in which students (collaborating in crews of four) are exposed to a broad range of production techniques through production experience and class discussion. Each group produces four color sync-sound exercises during the semester that explore craft, aesthetic, production and storytelling issues. As a group member, each student will serve in rotation as director, producer, camera, sound, and AC/gaffer. Students are encouraged to edit their work in the Intermediate Edit Workshop (H56.1018) the following semester.    Important note: students should enter Intermediate Narrative Production Workshop with a short (i.e., 3-5 pages, but no more than 8) script. The production work in this course is strenuous. Students should be conscious of this when designing their semester schedules.
