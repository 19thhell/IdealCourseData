Recently, she has been empirically studying and critically reflecting on the assumptions and methods that inform prominent strands of privacy research within computer science. Further topics of interest in her research include questions of privacy and design in online social networks, anonymity as a cultural and technical phenomenon, feminist critique of computer science and activist use of information technologies. Previously Seda was a postdoctoral researcher at COSIC (Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography) in the Department of Electrical Engineering of the KU Leuven and, recently, a visiting researcher at the e-Humanities Group of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in Amsterdam. At COSIC she acted as the coordinator of the interdisciplinary project SPION (Security and Privacy in Online Social Networks) funded by the Flemish Agency for Innovation in Science and Technology (IWT). Seda received her PhD at the Department of Computer Science of the KU Leuven, her Master's degree in Informatics at the Humboldt University Berlin (Germany), her B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in International Relations and Peace from the University of Redlands in the USA.

See her website .    Karen Levy    Karen Levy is a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication and in the Information Law Institute at New York University. Karen investigates how digital tools are used to enforce laws and rules, with a particular interest in the normalization of electronic surveillance within social and organizational settings, including homes and workplaces. Her research explores how digital monitoring changes social norms around accountability, discretion, and trust. Karen's dissertation work investigates how long-haul truckers in the United States contend with legal and organizational surveillance of their work practices. Karen holds a JD from Indiana University Maurer School of Law and a PhD in Sociology from Princeton University. She is also a fellow at the Data and Society Research Institute. See her website .    Christine Mitchell    Christine Mitchell is a postdoctoral fellow in Media, Culture, and Communication. Her research focuses on intersections of technology and language from media historical and institutional perspectives. She joins NYU from SpokenWeb , a digital poetry archive at Concordia University, where she explored the poetry series (1966-1974) as an instructional media production and directed a team in the creation of PoetryLab , an iOS app for sound recording, listening and archival exploration. Her dissertation at McGill University investigated materialities of language and translation through a media materialist history of automated translation systems and software. At MCC, she is working on a manuscript that emerges from her thesis, and embarking on a new project that explores the relationship between technological solutions for language acquisition and machine translation schemes, focusing on language laboratories of the 1950s-1970s in Canada and the US. Christine has taught courses in new media at McGill, her academic background includes studio arts and linguistics and she has a professional background in translation and language teaching.    Laine Nooney    Laine Nooney is a postdoctoral research fellow with the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing in the Department of Media, Culture and Communication. Laine is a media archaeologist of computers and video games, who brings historical, theoretical and feminist methods the study of everyday users and obsolete technology. Her current research project focuses on the history of Sierra On-Line and its female co-founder and lead designer, Roberta Williams. Corollary research interests include critical materialism, internet studies, affect theory, and social media. Laine is also an editorial group member for the Journal of Visual Culture. Laine has spoken internationally on video game history and culture, and has shared her research with NPR&rsquo;s Marketplace, KillScreen, and NYU&rsquo;s Game Center. See her website .    Heather Patterson    Heather Patterson is a postdoctoral research fellow at the Media, Culture, and Communications Department and in the Information Law Institute at New York University. Patterson researches changing social norms regarding personal information sharing and expectations of privacy, with an eye toward developing policy solutions that facilitate context-appropriate information flow. She received a JD from the UC Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 2012 and a PhD in cognitive psychology from the University of Washington in 2006. At Berkeley Law, Patterson worked within the Samuelson Law, Technology &amp; Public Policy Clinic to develop a framework for evaluating the privacy implications of biometric technologies such as face recognition, iris scanning, and gait recognition, and to develop privacy standards for emerging Smart Grid technologies before the California Public Utilities Commission. Prior to law school, Patterson used behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to assess the cognitive and neural basis of language perception, face recognition, and biological motion detection. She also holds an MA in linguistics from the University of Texas at Austin and a BS in neurobiology and physiology from Purdue University.    Dominique Trudel    Dominique Trudel is a postdoctoral fellow whose work focuses broadly on epistemological and political issues in the history of communication research and in the history of journalism practice. He is currently conducting research on Walter Lippmann's involvement in various intelligence and propaganda agencies during the Second World War and on early reception of cybernetics in post-war France. Dominique recently defended his dissertation at the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al, where he was a member of the Workshop in Radical Empiricism and of the Popular Culture, Knowledge and Critic Laboratory. He has taught at the Universit&eacute; de Sherbrooke and at the Universit&eacute; de Montr&eacute;al and has published articles on topics such as the history of communication research in Qu&eacute;bec, the construction of Walter Lippmann's historiographic personae, and Hunter S. Thompson's epistemology of journalism.    Joris van Hoboken    Joris van Hoboken is a Microsoft Research Fellow in the Information Law Institute at New York University. His research addresses law and policy in the field of digital media, electronic communications and the internet, with a focus on privacy and freedom of expression. Specific research interests include the regulation of selection intermediaries and new forms of publicity in the online environment, such as search engine and social media publicity, and the regulation of user data collection and use by online service providers and the implications thereof for privacy, data protection, access to information and competition. A transatlantic comparison of different regulatory approaches to the online environment is a central feature of his research and teaching. Van Hoboken is a specialist in European data protection and privacy law, search engine law and regulation and he regularly writes, teaches and presents on issues and developments in data protection, intermediary liability and freedom of expression on the Internet. Previously, Van Hoboken was a senior researcher at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands where he received a PhD in 2012 for his thesis on search engines and freedom of expression. In 2008, Van Hoboken was a Visiting Researcher at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. He has a degree in Law (LLM, 2006, cum laude) and Theoretical Mathematics (MSc, 2002, cum laude).

Her dissertation at McGill University investigated materialities of language and translation through a media materialist history of automated translation systems and software. At MCC, she is working on a manuscript that emerges from her thesis, and embarking on a new project that explores the relationship between technological solutions for language acquisition and machine translation schemes, focusing on language laboratories of the 1950s-1970s in Canada and the US. Christine has taught courses in new media at McGill, her academic background includes studio arts and linguistics and she has a professional background in translation and language teaching.
