In the Action Laboratory, we study behavioral flexibility--how people learn to adapt to changes in their bodies and skills and to variations in the environment.    We challenge infants, children, and adults with novel predicaments such as crawling over bridges, squeezing through apertures, brachiating over monkey bars, and reaching for targets with the body in motion. We observe people's actions using computerized video coding (Datavyu) and state-of-the-art recording technologies including gait carpets, motion tracking, head-mounted eye-tracking and remote eye-tracking.

Studies show that in emergency situations most people present would like to help, but very few actually do. Action Zone explores this phenomenon \u2013 The Bystander Effect \u2013 as well as when to intervene and when not to. Often, sexual assaults, alcohol-fueled incidents and other challenging situations can be prevented or diffused with timely, skilled and appropriate intervention. This dynamic, interactive training prepares participants to be allies in the NYU community.
