New York University's \"school of music\" has historically been housed in the Steinhardt School. Music programs were created in The Steinhardt School in 1925, approximately 40 years before the creation of NYU's (Tisch) School of the Arts. Consequently, all degrees in music performance at NYU -- baccalaureate through doctoral -- are housed in The Steinhardt School. Steinhardt's music performance programs in voice (classical and music theatre), piano, strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion, and jazz instruments are internationally recognized. Steinhardt provides intense music performance training along with top-tier music academic courses within the context of a world-renowned university.    Additional undergraduate and/or graduate music degrees are offered in Steinhardt in Music Composition, Music Business, Music Technology, Music Education, and Music Therapy. With 1,600 music majors and some 400 music faculty, the aggregate of Steinhardt's music programs represent one of the largest \"music schools\" in the United States.    Q. What is the difference between (1) Steinhardt's Music Business and Music Technology programs and (2) Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music?    First, for information regarding Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music, please visit their website . Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded music grants a BFA degree. By way of difference, students majoring in Steinhardt's Music Business Program or Steinhardt's Music Technology Program receive the B.M., the bachelor of music degree. Furthermore, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology students are required to complete an audition and to read music prior to admission to Steinhardt.    In accordance with national standards for undergraduate degrees in music, Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are required to complete 16 \"core\" courses, four each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation. That \"core\" curriculum of sixteen courses is not offered in Tisch.    In addition to the \"core\" curriculum, Steinhardt Music Business majors complete a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses in Music Business including internships, along with courses in The Stern School of Business and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences. Steinhardt Music Technology majors complete the sixteen \"core\" courses along with a very substantial number of courses in music technology in our multiple music recording studios and labs, internships, and liberal arts courses in The College of Arts and Sciences.    Steinhardt Music Business and Music Technology majors are often serious performers, composers and producers, who develop those talents through private music instruction with our acclaimed faculty.    While there are longstanding master's programs in Music Business and Music Technology in The Steinhardt School, at present, only the BFA is offered in Tisch's Clive Davis Department of Recorded Music.    Q. What is the difference between a music performance major and a music education major?    Music performance majors in Steinhardt receive \"music conservatory\" training as performers in preparation for careers in music performance. They are not required to take courses in music education, do not participate in student teaching, and are not certified to teach K-12.    Music Education majors in Steinhardt are expected to be outstanding musicians. Undergraduate music education majors have a \"primary instrument\" (instrument or voice), take private lessons throughout their four years, participate in ensembles, and present senior recitals on their primary instrument, very much like music performance majors. However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September.

However, in addition to intense study in music, music education majors take a substantial number of \"specialization\" courses related to music education, including mentored student teaching assignments. Upon completion of the B.M. degree, Steinhardt music education majors are able to teach K-12 in most states in the U.S. Each state has its own teacher licensing exams and guidelines, which may require completion of a masters&rsquo; degree within five years of completion of the bachelors degree.       Q. Can an undergraduate student who is not majoring in music in Steinhardt complete a music &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in Steinhardt?    Yes, non-Steinhardt music majors can complete a music minor in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts. The music minor consists of eight &ldquo;core&rdquo; courses &ndash; two courses each in (1) Music Theory, (2) Music History, (3) Aural Comprehension, and (4) Keyboard Harmony and Improvisation &ndash; as well as other music academic courses and private lessons and participation in ensembles.    However, Steinhardt does not offer program-specific minors. Consequently, we do not offer a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; in music performance, music composition, music business, music technology, or music education.    For more information, please click on &ldquo;Academics&rdquo; in this web site and scroll down to the bottom to &ldquo;Music Minor.&rdquo; In addition, please feel free to contact our department&rsquo;s coordinator of the music minor, Dr. Paul Horan at pgh1@nyu.edu or 212-998-5771.       Q. Can an undergraduate student majoring in Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Music and Performing Arts complete a minor in another department?    Yes, we encourage our undergraduate students to explore and complete one or more minors in areas in which they develop interest. Minors are available in several departments in The Steinhardt School as well as in the College of Arts and Sciences.       Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for private music lessons in Steinhardt?    For generations, Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts has provided non-department music majors with private music lessons. Lessons are offered in voice, guitar and most orchestral instruments in classical, jazz and music theatre styles. Students interested in registering for private music lessons may fill out the form available here .    Private music lessons lasting one full hour per week are four (4) credits and half hour lessons per week are two (2) credits. Please note that one full hour per week lessons for three (3) credits are restricted to Steinhardt Music Majors.    Private lesson teachers are assigned based on each student's skill level and assigned by the Steinhardt faculty and administration. Non-music major students with little or no music reading ability who are interested in piano, voice or guitar lessons are often required to take one semester of group piano, voice or guitar. Thereafter, private piano, voice or guitar lessons are assigned. Private lessons are available on most orchestral and jazz instruments.    However, there are some restrictions for students who are not majoring in music in Steinhardt. Due to space limitations, private lessons for non-Steinhardt music majors are not available on harp or drum set (rock and jazz). In addition, private instruction in classical percussion requires an audition with Professor Jonathan Haas, Director of Classical Percussion Studies, and if accepted, participation in percussion, orchestral and/or wind ensembles is required of students taking private classical percussion lessons.    Q: Can non-music majors (i.e., students not majoring in music in Steinhardt) register for music ensembles in Steinhardt?    Steinhardt Music and Performing Arts allows non-department music majors to register for department-based ensembles. Department ensembles include several choirs, close to thirty jazz ensembles (trio to nonet), two 18 piece jazz big bands, dozens of classical strings, woodwind, and brass ensembles, as well as The NYU Symphony Orchestra, Repertory Orchestra, and Community Orchestra. An audition is required for registration and participation in Steinhardt ensembles. Auditions are given at the beginning of the semester, particularly in early September.

We encourage feedback and commentary on all Student Outlook\u00a0 contributions. Leave a comment below or tweet us at\u00a0 @NYUMusicBiz .      I first came across j.viewz and The DNA Project when I was looking for an innovative figure to profile for the final piece of my Literary Reportage elective class at NYU. After talking with my friend and MUBG peer, Suzanne Rollins&#8212;who was interning for j.viewz (a position she found on the MUBG listserv)&#8212;she agreed that he would be a great fit for my piece on music innovation, put me in direct contact with j.viewz and the rest is history.   Jonathan Dagan, known as j.viewz, is an Israeli-born, independent songwriter, producer, remixer and visual artist. He has always been frustrated with the music industry\u2019s standard model: spend\u00a0a year or two recording an album away from the fans, release it, and then tour with a bunch of\u00a0songs that are no longer fresh. He is challenging this model with the DNA Project website, which\u00a0is designed to open up the album-making process to fans. The artist explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of\u00a0value in creating an album. I want to share and open that up to the audience.\u201d As a result, the\u00a0website will enable fans to track the creative process for each song in real time, from inspiring\u00a0moments on the road to new sounds from the studio and meetings with labels.   Standing at about 5\u20196, with tousled brown curls, a well-kept goatee, and wide, thin-rimmed\u00a0spectacles, j.viewz\u2019s physical appearance fits the mold of how one would expect a Grammy-nominated, avant-garde electronic folk artist to look. But don\u2019t expect any brooding here. The\u00a0multi-genre artist, whose sound has been compared to Cashmere Cat, Young Wonder and Slow\u00a0Magic, is an optimist at heart who believes in the power of music and using it to elevate\u00a0communication between the fan and the artist.   j.viewz, born in Haifa, the cultural hub of northern Israel\u2014which is approximately 56 miles\u00a0north of Tel Aviv\u2014explains that growing up in the country\u2019s third largest city contributed to his\u00a0proactivity in discovering new music. \u201cWhen you are into music growing up in Haifa, you have\u00a0to be really active about getting the music you want. There was no internet, so you\u2019d have to\u00a0travel to Tel Aviv and go the record store to hear the new Nine Inch Nails record. I had to seek\u00a0out people with the right records, people who knew about music.\u201d In so doing, the indie artist\u00a0confesses that he was not affected by Israeli music, but instead his experience with music in\u00a0Israel made him extremely active in finding and being appreciative of different genres of music.      Prior to moving to Brooklyn, NY, j.viewz found himself in a breakbeat band\u2014unconventional in\u00a0Israel\u2014where he performed at psy-trance parties. Recalling those early days of his music career,\u00a0j.viewz explains that such times molded him into the artist he is today: \u201cI had a breakbeat band\u00a0and the only place they could book us was at psy-trance parties. Now it\u2019s different in Israel, it\u2019s\u00a0very popular to know good music and the average level of musicianship is really, really high. But\u00a0avoidance of what was mainstream in Israel back then made me what I am.\u201d Avoiding the\u00a0mainstream for a deeper path and looking to create music that mattered to him, Jonathan Dagan\u00a0moved to the United States and became j.viewz.   The DNA Project, which went live late last year, has enabled the indie artist to release music\u00a0sooner and make it easier for him to respond to his fans. \u201cWhen you listen to an album, you can\u2019t\u00a0interact with it. It\u2019s a two, three year-old created product given to you. You\u2019ve got to accept\u00a0everything that comes with it.\u201d Consequently, j.viewz is using the DNA Project to create an interactive environment where both he and his fans can create, comment and edit music, in real-time.   This isn\u2019t the first time Dagan has experimented with the process of creating and distributing music. He was one of the first to use downloading and direct-to-fan interaction to sell albums and his second full-length album, Rivers And Homes (2011), was released one track at a time to fans who paid to subscribe to his music service. Once completed, Dagan distributed the finished album in physical form to his subscribers and later made it available to the general public. Rivers And Homes was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package, presented for the visual look of an album. Dagan didn\u2019t stop. In addition to recording the music, he shot a video for the title track off Rivers And Homes. The footage, which was shot in New York and Israel, was used to create two parallel videos\u2014a \u201cnormal\u201d music video which showed j.viewz walking through a snowy field wearing a cat costume and then another made up entirely by fans holding frames from the \u201cnormal\u201d video. Each frame from the normal video was printed and handed out to fans in the audience during his tour in Israel. In total, 300 fans were recruited to hold the still frames and 2,000 images were used in the making of Rivers And Homes, creating an \u201cingenious animation\u201d within the video. The frames were then reassembled as a stop motion video in which fans could tag themselves via a Taggable Player he designed. Rivers And Homes was nominated for an MTV Music Award for \u201cMost Innovative Video\u201d as well as a UK Music Video Award.   Dagan says that he never innovates just to innovate just as he does not want fans to engage in his work for the sake of engaging; there is a clear, strategic and valuable purpose behind all that he does. As a result, the DNA Project has fans participate at specific times and emphasizes how the fan and the artist are both a part of the same goal; the same journey. According to j.viewz, \u201can album doesn\u2019t have to be a documentation of something that happened in the past. It can be an interactive experience between artist and fan that exposes the creative process.\u201d Through the Project, the electronic-folk artist is symbolically opening up the studio to the fan in order to make the process of music available to everyone and essentially, make the process part of the art itself. It is a huge leap in the evolution of the artist-fan relationship.      j.viewz is also an advocate of trying new things, being committed to that experience and overall, remaining optimistic. The indie artist explained that days before the Kickstarter page went up to fund what is now the DNA Project website, he jumped out of a plane. \u201cIt symbolized jumping into a new experience with no doubts. You can have doubts but you must still be committed at the end.\u201d j.viewz explained that in jumping into a new experience, one must always have one thought in mind: success. However, success, not in the modern sense of the word\u2014which praises money and all things materialistic\u2014but rather in thinking positively, in believing that the outcome you are after will come into fruition and most importantly, in being optimistic that people will support your efforts.   It is this way of thinking that has enabled j.viewz to make human connection become a real and consistent thread weaved throughout his work. In doing so, he has not only contributed to the evolution of the artist-fan relationship but has allowed his fans to become investors in his art and essentially, his career; gradually erasing the role of the fan as a passive and silent investor. What is being created as a result of this evolution is a synergic relationship where the fan becomes more involved in the artist\u2019s career and in turn, the artist uses the relationship to further sustain their career.   Through past and current projects, j.viewz continues to allow his fans to take on the role of what academic Carsten Winter calls \u201cprosumers\u201d\u2014the hybrid of consumer and producer that the digital age has created. The fan, no longer a silent investor in the artist\u2019s career, has become the creator; crafting content that often progresses the artist\u2019s career and simultaneously, creates valuable engagement. \u201cFan participation creates a bigger togetherness. If I ever had a doubt of putting my heart out there, those events [i.e. the making of the Rivers and Homes video, the DNA Project, etc.] encourage me to do so.\u201d From their roles as collector\u2014one who adds tags to web pages or photos (as fans did in his 2012 Rivers And Homes video) and joiners\u2014those who support the artist through social media, blogs and crowdfunding (as fans did for j.viewz\u2019s Kickstarter page to fund The DNA Project website)\u2014to the ultimate role of creator\u2014those who upload audio/music, videos and artwork that they create (as fans have done for the DNA Project)\u2014the indie artist has made fan interaction his signature priority.      In discussing the double-edge sword role that technology plays\u2014allowing users to interact more frequently yet simultaneously shortening our attention spans as we quickly move onto the next phenom\u2014j.viewz is an optimist. The indie artist explained that with the temporary trait that comes with technology, there is an \u201cimpermanence of music\u201d being expressed. Because we, as music fans, are more aware of how brief each moment is, we are able to embrace and appreciate each event. j.viewz romanticized, \u201cThere\u2019s something beautiful about honoring the moment together with our short attention spans. It\u2019s all a brief moment\u2014we celebrate, we dance, we die.\u201d   The digital age has radically put a damper on the music industry\u2019s plan of pushing music onto passive consumers. Thanks to digital network media such as YouTube and SoundCloud, ordinary people are now creating value in relation to music, without the involvement of record labels and at lower costs. Everyone is now a prosumer. Using these new media to undertake activities like commenting, criticizing, sharing, producing, posting and publishing, \u201cprosumers\u201d are able to innovate socially and culturally while simultaneously, creating cultural and social value instead of just economic value. Gone are the push-method days of the industry spoon-feeding us which genres to consume. Prosumers are now pulling the music and the artists that they want towards them.   The impermanence of music has enabled music fans to be far more proactive in not only discovering new artists and music but most importantly, connecting with the artist. The growing trend of artists communicating with fans via social media as well as fans supporting their idols through crowd-funding platforms like Kickstarter has essentially broken down the barriers of communication between fan and artist. With the door to communication wide open, another fascinating result is occurring: the mysterious, god-like image of the artist is gradually fading. j.viewz proclaimed, \u201cImpermanence of music has reduced the fantasy. The artist is no longer untouchable, inaccessible.\u201d Live-streams of artists in the studio and backstage at shows can now be viewed and shared, personal photos from their everyday lives can be liked, their random thoughts for the masses can be retweeted: transparency is the driver of the new music economy.   Ultimately, j.viewz\u2019s mission is to explore different ways to improve the communication aspect of music and uncover how technology, when used in certain (unconventional) ways, allows us to connect to people in an immediate way. The indie artist continues to radically shape the industry through his persistent, innovative efforts to bridge the gaps between music and technology as well as the artist and the fan. \u201cI think music is the best communication tool. If I want to translate my experience to you, I can do it in words, but there are only so many words. With music, there\u2019s no word for it, but there is a chord for it. When you put yourself and your heart out there, people will respond.\u201d   Connect with j.viewz on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Soundcloud , and Youtube .

I&#8217;m from Ardsley, NY, just a short train ride outside of the city.   What is your background in music?   I&#8217;ve been singing my whole life, but participating in my middle and high school select choirs was where I gained a more serious passion for music.\u00a0 In high school I started writing songs, playing in a band, and taking more formal voice lessons at Lagond Music School in Elmsford, NY.\u00a0 It was there that I really started to consider music as a career, and not necessarily only as a performer.\u00a0 Though I&#8217;ve been focused on the business side of the industry throughout the last 4 years, I&#8217;ve continued songwriting and performing,\u00a0and have released an album and an EP of original music, as well as a few co-writes on another artist&#8217;s EP.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve also\u00a0been managing a few acts that I&#8217;ve met through NYU which has been an incredible learning experience.   Why did you decide to come to NYU?   I decided to come to NYU because Steinhardt&#8217;s Music Business program allowed me to continue my musical training, through music theory and aural comprehension classes as well as private lessons and ensembles, while also receiving an education in business, specific music business classes, and a great liberal arts program as well.\u00a0 Being in NYC is invaluable for wanting to break into the music industry.\u00a0 I never would have been able to have the internships and opportunities I&#8217;ve had here if I were in another city.\u00a0 Finally, I just really love the diverse group of people at NYU.\u00a0 I&#8217;ve encountered people studying everything from film, to dance, to global liberal studies, and the music community is so diverse in and of itself!\u00a0 I love being part of a community of so many talented people following their passions in so many different areas.\u00a0 Plus, it&#8217;s nice to be so close to home!   Who are some of your favorite musical artists?   My favorite musician and songwriter is John Mayer.\u00a0 I also really admire Sara Bareilles.\u00a0 Lately I&#8217;ve been super into jazz, soul, and funk, and some of my favorites are Stevie Wonder, Tony Bennett, Aretha Franklin, Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, and Nikki Yanofsky.\u00a0 I&#8217;m also a Taylor Swift fan!   Do you have any musical guilty pleasures?   I grew up listening to pop, and that&#8217;s what I write a lot of the time.\u00a0 So\u00a0I am not ashamed to admit\u00a0that you can often find me jamming out to\u00a0One Direction!   What have been some of your favorite music business classes/professors in your time here?   My favorite music business class has to have been Music Publishing.\u00a0 Our professor, Jennifer Blakeman, currently works in the industry, so her perspective is very relevant.\u00a0 She turned a subject that some consider to be a bit boring into an extremely interesting and fun class, and since then I&#8217;ve been working towards pursuing a career in publishing.   Have you had any really cool music-related moments in New York?   It is hard to choose just one!\u00a0 I&#8217;ve gotten to attend some great events as a member of GRAMMY U, the Recording Academy&#8217;s organization for students of the music industry&#8211;like soundchecks for artists like Esperanza Spalding and the Zac Brown Band, and hearing Alicia Keys and her producer speak at the studio where she records.\u00a0 Last semester I took a class called Topics in Recorded Music: Aretha Franklin &amp; Soul Music, and we got to attend a conversation at the 92nd Street Y with Clive Davis and Aretha herself about her career and newest album.\u00a0 Finally, a really awesome New York musical moment has to be when I saw Billy Joel play at Madison Square Garden this past summer.\u00a0 Hearing him play &#8220;New York State of Mind&#8221; live in NYC was a really emotional experience for me.   What was your best Internship?   I honestly believe I&#8217;ve learned something valuable from every one of my internships.\u00a0 If I had to choose a favorite, it would be Wind Up Songs, where I&#8217;m currently interning.\u00a0 I love how small the company and the roster are.\u00a0 It allows me to get my hands into all facets of the company&#8217;s operations, and do work that&#8217;s actually meaningful.\u00a0 I also love how writer-focused the company is.\u00a0 Other internship highlights for me include Downtown Music Publishing, and working with artist Garland Jeffrey&#8217;s manager.       What is your dream job?   I would love to someday be a working songwriter wth my own production/publishing company.\u00a0 I want to be able to write for and develop artists, while also fostering the careers of other songwriters.\u00a0 Kara Dioguardi and Dr. Luke, two of my favorite songwriters, have each done something like this.       Are you leaving the program with different career aspirations than you had when you entered the program?   I definitely think I have a more entrepreneurial spirit than when I came here.\u00a0 While I didn&#8217;t know exactly what I wanted to do in the music industry as a freshman, I definitely wasn&#8217;t considering the option of starting my own business.\u00a0 Now, I manage a few artists and bands, and am looking to start my own publishing company!       What is your advice for any incoming freshmen or transfer students to the program?   Try everything, talk to everyone, and be aggressive in pursuing your passions.\u00a0 NYU, NYC, and the music industry are not places where you can expect to get what you want handed to you on a silver platter.\u00a0 It&#8217;s important to take initiative and find out what really excites you, and then go for it!\u00a0 That being said, don&#8217;t take anything too seriously, and remember not to get too hard on yourself.\u00a0 Have fun, too!                              Posted by ms6741 on April 16, 2015 12:49 pm   | Permalink |   Comments                                  Senior Spotlight: Sarah Segner                 Where are you from?   Cherry Hill, NJ   What is your background in music?   I began studying the violin at seven and it pretty much took over my life by high school. I also studied piano, mandolin, and guitar, and was in Philadelphia Youth Orchestra and had my own string quartet before I came to college.   Why did you decide to come to NYU?   As a freshman in high school I realized that I wanted to earn a degree in Music Business. I had always wanted to move to New York City, and when I found out that NYU has one of the top Music Business programs in the country, it became my top choice. I wanted to be able to jump start my career while still an undergraduate, and center myself in one of the capitals of the music industry. I also knew I would have a ton of performance opportunities, and that&#8217;s proven true; I&#8217;m in a band and regularly perform in classical music concerts, usually in the contemporary classical world.       Who are some of your favorite musical artists?   I&#8217;ve got a pretty eclectic taste in music. In the rock realm Led Zeppelin, Alt-J, and Nine Inch Nails are favorites. If we get more pop-oriented, I&#8217;m very into Rufus Wainwright, Gabriel Kahane and Woodkid. I love folk music, both in the American sense (Dylan, Baez, etc) and the international sense (I&#8217;m very into Persian classical music and Eastern European folk music). In the classical world, some of my favorite composers are Igor Stravinsky, Morton Feldman, Jean Sibelius, Gustave Mahler, and Josquin des Prez.   Do you have any musical guilty pleasures?   Oh yeah&#8230;most definitely. Does Lana Del Rey count? Also Coldplay. I&#8217;m not a superfan but I&#8217;m kind of embarrassed that Coldplay is in my iTunes library.   What have been some of your favorite music business classes/professors in your time here?   I really loved Entrepreneurship. I had been harboring a start-up idea for a few years, and that class really let me learn how to map it out and maybe, hopefully implement it. Larry Miller has so much experience, and he&#8217;s a great teacher and mentor. I also loved Sam Howard-Spink&#8217;s classes because his brand of philosophy on capitalism fascinates me.   Have you had any really cool music-related moments in New York?   There are too many to list. I&#8217;ll name two. The sheer energy at a Woodkid show at Webster Hall in 2013 was intoxicating. He hadn&#8217;t played in the US for a long time, or at that size of a venue, and it was amazing to see an artist who identifies mostly with a European audience get a huge reaction in the US. It was part of a CMJ showcase, so I had been selling it to people that whole week and I think I got some props from friends for introducing them to Woodkid.   The second moment was a pretty geeky classical music one. I was at the Bang on a Can marathon in 2014, and a friend of mine was clapping the rhythmic pattern from Steve Reich&#8217;s &#8220;Clapping Music.&#8221; David Lang, a co-founder of Bang on a Can and a rock star in the contemporary classical music world, walked by and started clapping the pattern back at our group. Geeky and pretty awesome for us.   What was your best Internship?   I really loved my internship at 21C Media Group. It&#8217;s a small publicity/marketing firm that works primarily in the classical music business. Because the company is so small, I got to work with everyone on the team and on some very high profile accounts. While I also enjoyed internships at larger organizations like Lincoln Center, I felt like I was really a part of the team at 21C.    Sarah with the string quartet Brooklyn Rider. Sarah acts as an artistic consultant and coordinator for two of the members.   What is your dream job?   Thinking really, really big? I want to be the Artistic Director of my own festival presented by an organization like Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall.   Are you leaving the program with different career aspirations than you had when you entered the program?   Slightly, yes. I came into the program wanting to produce in the studio. Now, I&#8217;m finding that I&#8217;m much more interested in the live industry (which is also of course where the money is, so that&#8217;s a bonus). I&#8217;m still interested in producing, but in the live sense, and I&#8217;ve found that I love to curate concerts and festivals, so I&#8217;d love to get into the artistic planning end of the classical music industry.   What is your advice for any incoming freshmen or transfer students to the program?   Internships are absolutely key to your undergraduate experience. I&#8217;ve held six during my time at NYU, and because I&#8217;ve applied myself and worked in a ton of areas within the music industry, I have a very rich contact base already, before I&#8217;ve started working full time. Also in relation to internships, try working for a smaller company. Often you will have more involved responsibilities and fewer &#8220;intern&#8221; duties if you&#8217;re at a smaller company, and if you really shine in your position, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll get asked to stay on as an intern or as a full-time employee. There&#8217;s more opportunity to promote yourself and really get to know your co-workers at a small company.

I am from Carmel, NY in Putnam County. It&#8217;s about 50 miles north of the city. I&#8217;ve lived in New York my whole life!     What is your background in music?   I grew up in a family that loved music. My uncle played the guitar and the banjo, much to my dismay since I hated bluegrass music. So to rebel from learning those instruments, I started playing cello when I was 10 years old and taught myself piano at the same time. I was the type of kid who practiced for 3 hours every single day, solely because I just loved music. I started auditioning for the All-County orchestras at a young age and then moved on to NYSSMA&#8217;s Area-All State Orchestra. My true love and background in music, however, was playing piano in the pit orchestra of my high school&#8217;s musical productions. It&#8217;s an entirely different world of music and I thrived in it.     Why did you decide to come to NYU?   Having grown up in New York my entire life, I knew I wanted to stay close and the city was right there. NYU was always the dream college for me and when I found out that there was a combination of music and business in NYU Steinhardt, it was just the perfect fit. I could study music theory and practice my instruments while I also got to study my second passion of marketing.   Who are some of your favorite musical artists?   Some of my favorite artists are: Bastille, Mumford &amp; Sons, CHVRCHES, Layla, and to throw in a musical theatre composer(s), Kerrigan &amp; Lowdermilk.   Do you have any musical guilty pleasures?   Not in particular, but I do love listening to musical theatre. I could listen to Broadway show-tunes all day long. I also love doing homework to orchestral soundtracks of films. Currently, The Theory of Everything&#8217;s Original Motion Picture Soundtrack by Johann Johannsson is my one of my favorites.   What have been some of your favorite music business classes/professors in your time here?   As the undergraduate student assistant to the program, I have to say that every professor in the program is my favorite. In particular, I have thoroughly enjoyed Music Publishing with adjunct faculty member Jennifer Blakeman and Interactive, Internet, and Mobile Music with Professor Sam Howard-Spink. Of course, I can&#8217;t leave out Dr. Catherine Moore who has been a mentor to me through and through.\u00a0One of my favorite projects to work on with Dr. Moore was the Global Music Trends Analysis independent study while I was studying abroad in London. We got to choose our topics as we were guided by Dr. Moore throughout the process. My topic was on global music festival marketing and an expansion report of C3 Presents in the United Kingdom.       You work under Dr. Moore as the student assistant. Tell us about your experience working for the Music Business department.   I was hired during my sophomore year as the assistant to the Undergraduate program. I absolutely love working in the office as every day is always something new. We are always brainstorming new ideas and changes for the program. I love thinking of new developments and collaborating with not only who I consider my professors, but also my colleagues and supervisors.         Have you had any really cool music-related moments in New York?   One time I was waiting for the L train and there was a violinist on the 8th Avenue-bound platform and a cellist on the Brooklyn-bound platform. They were so far away from each other but they were both playing a piece together across the platforms. It was one of the coolest things I have seen in street performance. By themselves, they sounded amazing and then together, if you listened carefully amidst the rumblings of the L and the uncomfortable voice the L train female announcer, it was even better.   What was your best Internship?   It is hard to choose. I have been very lucky to have had many amazing internships across the theatrical industry as that is my focus in the music and entertainment business\u2014Don&#8217;t Tell Mama Cabaret, Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein Organization, The New York Musical Theatre Festival, and now at The Nederlander Organization. I do have to say that being at NYMF was an extremely life-changing experience. I felt like an essential part of the team at such a small company with big plans. I learned more than I ever did and got to do so much hands-on work with essential people in the Broadway industry.   What was one of your favorite projects at NYMF that you worked on at NYMF?   At NYMF, I had an array of very serious projects, but my favorite was the preparation of a live social media feed for the NYMF Gala. I got to live tweet, Facebook, and Instagram the entire night taking pictures of Broadway celebrities and covering every foot of the theater as fast as possible. It was an extremely hectic night, but an unbelievable success! My other project was a bit more confidential, but I can say that it did involve a lot of work with branding which helped me learn a lot more about a sector of marketing that I didn&#8217;t know much about.   What is your dream job?   Ultimately, I would love to leave this program with a job in digital marketing in the theatre industry. I want to move Broadway into the fast, constantly-changing tech industry. To be able to do that in any capacity would be great. Maybe,one day, working in London would be a great chance for a dream job.   When you took the Entrepreneur class your project focused on bringing the tech world into broadway. Tell us about your project.   During Entrepreneurship for the Music Industry last semester, I created a project that digitized the rush ticket policies of Broadway theaters&#8217; box offices. Similar to that of WunWun and Uber, it allowed you to reserve rush tickets for last minute shows and acquire information about rush policies in one consolidated location. Since then, I&#8217;ve been able to develop my idea more and maybe one day I can bring it to life.   Are you leaving the program with different career aspirations than you had when you entered the program?   Absolutely. Entering this program, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure what I wanted to do. I knew I loved marketing and I knew that I loved theatre. I thought the only path for that was to become a producer. However, from being exposed and seizing the opportunities I have been lucky to have, I can see myself and my career path in an entirely new way.   What is your advice for any incoming freshmen or transfer students to the program?   I took Producing Off-Broadway in the Tisch Open Arts program my sophomore year. It was in that class that I got some of the best advice that changed a lot. &#8220;Never say no, but know when to say no.&#8221; Try to seize every opportunity. No job is too small. Do not let things come to you, but instead, find every opportunity you can and go for it. When you start saying yes, things will start to change. But, know when it has become too much and that you need to breathe for a moment. Last piece of advice? Study abroad.                            Posted by ms6741 on February 20, 2015 11:42 am   | Permalink |   Comments                                  MUBG Alum&#8217;s Band Set To Release Fifth Album               Oxygen is a world music band based in Chennai, India and co-founded by Prithvi Kumar (G \u201914) in 2003, at age 14. Prithvi serves as both the drummer and lead vocalist for the group. Oxygen represents a fusion of Indian and Western music forms . They place great emphasis on experimenting with different genres of music and strive to maintain a unique and distinct sound. \u00a0They have released four albums to date, all of which have been well received. Success of their records led to widespread interest and interviews with leading Indian TV channels including NDTV 24/7, Headlines Today, and Aaj Tak, and features in national newspapers like The Hindu, The Indian Express, The Times Of India and Deccan Chronicle.   Among their accomplishments is winning a TV music talent contest that was judged by Academy Award- and Grammy Award-winning composer A.R. Rahman. They were then invited to A.M Studios in Chennai to record a song produced by Rahman.\u00a0VELOCITY sat down with Prithvi to talk about Oxygen\u2019s new albums and how his NYU education has affected his career as an artist.   How did Oxygen form, and how do you stay connected with the band while you&#8217;re at NYU?   Oxygen was formed when I met Giri at a cultural festival in high school. It was something equivalent to a Battle of the Bands event in the US. We were from different high schools and were actually competing against each other. Although I forget who ended up winning the overall prize, I won the best drummer award and he won the best keyboardist award. We had a chat after and decided to form a new band. Our &#8220;home base&#8221; is Chennai and our audience for the most part is based in South India. I keep visiting India every 6 months or so and finish composing and recording while I&#8217;m there. It\u2019s usually a three-week trip, which gives us a good amount of time to get things done.   Where and when did you write and record Volume 1?   Volume 1 is actually a culmination of our work over the last five years or so. We had lots of random material in our hard drives and sat down one day and picked what we felt were the most appealing tunes. We found that there were close to 15 tracks that we really liked but couldn&#8217;t include them all in one album which is why we decided to split the release. Volume 1 was released in January and we hope to release Volume 2 by July. We have our own studio in Chennai called Aura Studios where were wrote and recorded all of our songs.   What is the concept behind the album?      We wanted to produce a record that had something for everyone. In our newest offering, each of our tracks is based on a different genre. We have two tracks with vocals and the rest are instrumental. The tracks range from rock to classical to Indian folk.    Photo by Swathy Sekaran   Have you toured in the past, and do you have plans to tour to promote the new albums?   We have toured extensively within India and have also given performances in the UK. \u00a0We are definitely planning a tour towards the later part of 2014. The reason being, we wanted to wait till we release Volume 2. We believe that with both Volume 1 and 2 out, there will be more variety to present to our audience and hit them with a completely new setlist and experience.   Did being a member of Oxygen play a part in your decision to pursue a degree in Music Business?      It certainly did. I knew what it was to be an artist but hadn&#8217;t quite explored the business side of music yet. All of us in Oxygen have undergrad degrees in different fields from engineering to accounting and business. On the other hand, I personally wanted to learn how the music industry works outside the Indian subcontinent, which is why I decided to apply to NYU.   Do the other band members have an in-depth knowledge of the music industry?   They do have a good understanding of the music industry in India. The business model in India is totally different from those used in the US. Its very film-centric and independent musicians don&#8217;t get enough recognition when compared to their Bollywood counterparts. This however is slowly changing with new social media outlets and numerous festivals such as NH7 and Sunburn.   Have you been able to apply your NYU education to your band&#8217;s career?      I certainly have. In fact, I used some of the material from our A&amp;R class taught by Dr. Moore during the recording of Volume 1 in December. Material from Strategic Marketing in the Music Industry also helped when we were drawing up our marketing plan for Volume 1 and 2.   Did anything surprise you as you went from the performance side of music to the business side of music?      To some extent it did. I interned at Sony Music last year where I was exposed to a completely new side of the music business. My team worked on identifying potential partners in the digital space and strengthening existing partnerships with some of the industry&#8217;s leading players. It\u2019s something I would never have been able to experience if I weren&#8217;t in New York City and I&#8217;m grateful to the people who have helped me so far and continue to support me in all my endeavors.

Following our fall recording\u00a0session with the Australian band Tigertown, we are now placing the final touches\u00a0on a project in which we are printing vinyl postcards featuring their song \u201cWhat You\u00a0Came Here For\u201d recorded last semester with the VR team. The vinyl postcards\u00a0will be used for promotion and sent to a variety of influencers in the music industry\u00a0in order to increase visibility and establish new connections for the band. It is an\u00a0exciting process and we strongly believe this outreach could lead to future projects\u00a0for Tigertown.   Village Records has also recently concluded an extensive A&amp;R search, and after\u00a0reviewing many talented artists we have finally decided to work with the talented\u00a0 Kiah Victoria , an NYU Tisch senior. At such a young age Kiah has already had a\u00a0great deal of experience in the world of performing. From starring in the Lion King\u00a0on Broadway at age 10 to being featured in Jay-Z\u2019s \u201cPicasso Baby\u201d it is clear Kiah is\u00a0destined for great things and VR is very excited to be working with her.\u00a0As a kick-off to the start of this new partnership, VR will be working in collaboration\u00a0with the Concert Management class to help promote Kiah\u2019s upcoming performance\u00a0on May 3 at 11:30 pm ET at Joe\u2019s Pub. As a preview before this show VR will\u00a0be streaming a short acoustic session of Kiah performing in Washington Square\u00a0Park. This performance will be the start of an ongoing \u201cVR: Sessions in the Square\u201d\u00a0series produced by VR featuring musicians from NYU and the Greenwich Village\u00a0area playing under the arch. All session performances will be streamed online\u00a0through the Stageit platform.

Students were in three cities on three continents, literally spanning the world: Prague, Shanghai and Buenos Aires.   As the final assignment for the course, each student proposed to a music company of their choice expansion into the territory in which they were based for the semester. Their proposals describe the opportunity for the company that the students saw in the country they were located. Based on their research and observations over the semester, students justify their choices of opportunity with specific reference to the company\u2019s current situation and explain how the expansion will benefit the company. Furthermore, the reports provide details of a plan for the company to enter the new market.     Students covered a wide range of company types, and the companies originate from many parts of the world. Here are excerpts from the five student reports:      Adam Pyarali (UG \u201915): Spotify, based in Sweden, to Czech Republic   Our first year in the Czech Republic will be dedicated to establishing ourselves amongst said target market as the \u201cgo to\u201d music service. Continuing on, we will shift our dedication on pushing subscriptions much harder to ultimately accomplish our primary goal of having 15% of Spotify users in the Czech Republic as paying subscribers.   Spotify is a well-known international brand which carries much stature in the majority of the world\u2019s biggest markets. Its introduction to the Czech Republic needs to be pushed hard through an integrated marketing campaign. While almost everyone consumes music on a daily basis, the entire population will not be interested in a digital music streaming service. To avoid overspending on promotion, we will focus solely on our target markets to build a consumer base in the Czech Republic.   To create buzz, Spotify will allow bloggers and journalists early access to the service to publish their thoughts on the company moving to the Czech Republic. These \u201cearly adopter\u201d articles will create an initial interest in the service amongst web-friendly consumers. To connect with the Czech youth, Spotify will partner with local high schools and colleges to teach the ins and outs of the music streaming service focusing on four main points: it is cheap, unlimited, legal, and supports your favorite artists. There has been a disconnect with streaming services in the Czech Republic in the past few years with companies failing to make much impact, but we feel Spotify has the means to educate the Czech people.   Editor\u2019s note: In December 2013, just after Adam finished his report, Spotify announced that they will be opening in the Czech Republic.      Nick Kohler (UG \u201915): Ultra Music, based in the US, to China   It\u2019s surprising that, with the seemingly rapid expansion of the Ultra Music brand, especially in the festival circuit, China has been left alone. China\u2019s unparalleled economic growth isn\u2019t just helping its powerful government, as it is also reflected in the upwardly mobile middle class who, for the first time, has a disposable income to spend on leisure and entertainment. It\u2019s downright shocking to see that almost every single club in Shanghai is filled\u00a0 every day of the week , and the people filling them aren\u2019t just the old money crowd, but also the young, hip crowd who have found their way in this ever increasing economy of opportunity. These \u201cnew-money\u201d young adults are more than willing to spend a sizeable chunk of change, as the frugal stereotype of the Chinese is slowly but surely fading with each passing year. Combine this new wealth with the newfound Chinese love of the global EDM phenomenon, and an entry for Ultra is primed for success.   Expanding into China has distinct benefits for Ultra Music that span beyond profit. As there are currently no labels dedicated solely to electronic dance music in China, Ultra will possess a first mover advantage that will likely ensure its top stake over the other labels that are most certainly going to expand to China later in the game due to its growth. The addition of one of the fastest growing sectors in the nightlife market to this new global EDM empire will certainly solidify Ultra\u2019s position as the largest and most influential firm in all of Electronic Dance Music. Ultra will have the help of Sony\u2019s network as well as the west-obsessed culture of China to minimize the risk of such a major advancement, thus making China the most logical and beneficial location to proceed.      Forrest Durell (UG \u201915): The Bowery Presents, based in the US, to Argentina   Argentina has one of the fastest growing economies in the world and as a country moves from the second to first world status, they widen the middle class and citizens are able to spend more money on entertainment. In Argentina, the main clubs are full every night with people dancing \u2013 no just moving their hips to the music but actually dancing. They have a vibrant culture full of long conversations, late meals and a recently rich musical history.   Aside from booking some of the bands that have played/are going to play in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the Bowery Presents has no relation to this South American city. Buenos Aires is one of the most affluent cities in South America but, unlike Rio de Janeiro, Santiago or Sao Paulo, they don\u2019t have a solid live music scene. Argentines themselves are into music \u2013 going out to clubs and dancing to electronic hits, going to small bars and listening to Cumbia or Reggae music and even selling out most every show that comes to their bigger live music venues like Teatro Vorterix (1700 capacity) and Luna Park (5000-8000 capacity). There may be live music infrastructure for when huge acts like Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder or even buzzing indie bands like Tame Impala and Beach House come to Buenos Aires but there\u2019s no system in place to help nurture organic live performance growth for bands from the city/country. If a company like the Bowery Presents could come to Argentina with their business strategy, they could be the catalyst the live music culture in Buenos Aires needs.        Alex Blanton (Stern \u201915):\u00a0 The Pacha Group, based in Spain, to China   Pacha\u2019s opportunity is not only to usurp attention and patrons from Shanghai\u2019s mediocre to poorly managed current clubs, but to also take a leading role in Shanghai\u2019s continued cultural growth. Unlike a saturated market such as New York, Shanghai still has plenty of room for expansion. While most Chinese are already large consumers of entertainment in the form of music, movies, and tv shows streamed over the internet, most are not wealthy enough to enjoy most forms of live entertainment. Currently, most local patrons of nightclubs are of the upper class. China is a nation of great income inequality, and only the very wealthy have the resources and the time to enjoy late nights of drink, dance, and general revelry. However, as China\u2019s middle class continues to grow, more and more Chinese will thirst for live entertainment on which to spend their hard earned renminbi. Another key implication of Shanghai\u2019s growth is that the city\u2019s expat population, which already boasts nearly 200,000 people, will also grow. Expats are the other major group that frequents the clubs of Shanghai, and the city\u2019s economic emergence will only impel more foreigners to move here.   So where\u2019s the opportunity of Pacha in this odd and sometimes confusing landscape? Pacha can find its niche in the city by appealing westerners who thirst for quality music and a participatory, dancefriendly atmosphere, and Chinese to desire big nights out associated with famous brands. The key difference is that Pacha itself will be the brand of celebrity people are attracted to, rather than the international artists who get booked there. It is inevitable that some international club brand will eventually take this approach to succeed in Shanghai. The tablebased, big name artist business model the current big clubs employ is not sustainable and something will have to change eventually. Some entrepreneurs are attempting a new approach by bringing festivals to Shanghai that feature a few big names, but mainly showcase up and coming and underground acts. Eric Zho, organizer of the recent Storm Music Festival in Shanghai, has said &#8220;we believe Shanghai&#8217;s live music scene is missing the midtier artist shows. Most Chinese are still only exposed to major pop stars from the West. It is still mainly driven by celebrity culture, rather than strictly music.&#8221; Pacha could certainly find a niche by pioneering the midtier artist space. By establishing the Pacha lifestyle brand successfully in the city, people will instinctively trust Pacha with providing a fantastic night out even if they haven\u2019t heard of a particular artist playing that evening. That dynamic will not only be financially beneficial for Pacha, but will help increase the music IQ of Shanghai in general.      Michael Chrupcala (UG \u201915): C3 Presents, based in the US, to Czech Republic   Prague, certainly a robust music market, has room to grow before matching Chicago or Buenos Aires. Market research shows that the Czech Republic \u201caccounts for 0.8% of European consumer electronics market value\u201d which is comprised of CD and MP3 players, among other devices. As such, C3 would encounter little competition upon expansion. Prague Spring International Music Festival is the sole annual music festival in the city, and it focuses on symphony and chamber music.   To grow brand recognition, C3 Presents is advised to produce an annual festival held in the venues of Prague with capacities ranging from 300-1,000. Styled after CMJ Music Marathon and South By Southwest, a multitude of medium-sized stages would form the bulk of festival programming, since most Czechs will be unfamiliar with indie and alternative Western artists such as Local Natives and Foals. As Lollapalooza is renowned for its headliners, the O2 Arena in Prague 9 (capacity: 17,360) would showcase the likes of Mumford and Sons, The Killers, and Ellie Goulding. Such an approach is necessary; festival attendance will likely meet 20,000, which will only grow along with the long-term development of the market. This figure is determined from the draw of other festivals in the Czech Republic: notably, Colours of Ostrava (30,000) and Mighty Sounds (12,000).   Market entry in 2014 would be highly effective. As mentioned above, the Czech Republic is influenced by the alternative rock that followed grunge, which Lollapalooza seems to currently showcase. To follow our past example, partnership with a local promoter is ideal. Pairing with GEO in Brazil, Lotus Productions in Chile, and Fenix Entertainment Group in Argentina has proved that the expertise of a company immersed in the target location is priceless. Charm Music &#8212; the Czech division of Istanbul-based production company Charmenko &#8212; may be an effective partner, as they have recently booked the likes of Yo La Tengo and My Bloody Valentine in Prague.

The panel addressed the evolving role of mixtapes. \u201cThe nomenclature needs to be updated, because it\u2019s basically an album,\u201d said Tabron. \u201cTo me, growing up, it was a way to hear something exclusive. The difference between a mixtape and an album is in the marketing.\u201d Sean C. added, \u201cPeople use the term \u2018mixtape\u2019 to take pressure off of themselves. They don\u2019t want pressure from the label to have as much success as an \u2018album\u2019 even though they\u2019re the same thing.\u201d The once-competitive mixtape circuit has become accessible to anyone. The panelists agreed that success in today\u2019s mixtape circuit lies in one\u2019s connections, networking and social media skills.    Professor Larry Miller introduces the panel (Photo by Carl Chisolm, courtesy of Red Bull)   Given that music creation has become so accessible, Reid asked the panelists to weigh in on the idea of needing the \u201cmachine\u201d of a major label. Reid cited Macklemore as a hip-hop artist who achieved success without a label, and in his success, still does not rely on one. Styles P said, \u201cMajor labels are machines. But when you\u2019re independent, you become the machine. The majors are now looking at the artist as the type of machine they are. They\u2019ll ask, \u2018What\u2019s your Twitter following?\u2019 They want someone who invests in themselves. At the end of the day you\u2019re the machine anyway. It comes down to how much work you\u2019re willing to do.\u201d   But at a time when anyone can make music and use social media, how does an aspiring artist stand out from the crowd and make him or herself valuable? Sean C. stressed the importance of relationships and networking. Tabron added, \u201cKnow your audience. And in terms of staying power, you need to be yourself. People respond to sincerity.\u201d   On one end of the table sat Styles P, who has been active in the New York hip-hop scene for over 20 years and offered insightful retrospectives. On the other end were CharlieRED\u2019s Chauncy Sherod and Cobaine Ivory, a young duo who released their first EP in December 2012. The diversity of the panelists offered contrasting points of view, but all of the panelists agreed that New York rap is in a good place, and are optimistic for the future. Tabron justified his optimism with a simple yet thought-provoking argument: \u201cA river is always strongest at the source.\u201d                          Posted by Melanie Greene on March 27, 2014 2:33 pm   | Permalink |   Comments                                  Industry Pioneer Jac Holzman Presented with Music Business Visionary Award              On Wednesday, March 12, NYU Steinhardt proudly presented industry pioneer Jac Holzman with the third Music Business Program Visionary Award. The award honors a business figure of note for their lasting and positive impact on the music industry through innovative, effective and creative business leadership.   Holzman sat down with Faculty Songwriter-in-Residence and Master Teacher in Songwriting Phil Galdston before an audience of Music Business students, alumni, faculty, and Holzman\u2019s own family, friends and colleagues to discuss Holzman\u2019s unique and extraordinary perspective on the history and future of music and technology. In the course of the conversation, Holzman explained in-depth the creation of Elektra Records in his college dorm room in 1950, and Nonesuch Records in 1964. He also discussed in detail his process of developing bands like Love, The Doors and The Paul Butterfield Blues Band.   Holzman entered the recorded music industry at a time \u201cwhen independents started in the same place. We didn\u2019t know what to do, so we made it up as we went along and learned how to move to our own internal drummer.\u201d Holzman reminisced about a time, particularly the 1950s, when independent record labels communicated with each other about almost everything. \u201cIt was convivial and nobody was trying to push the other person underwater.\u201d Holzman considers these years to be the time in recorded music history that is most essential to the future of the music industry.      To Holzman, working in the music industry is not a job, but a calling. \u201cA calling is something you can\u2019t resist.\u201d After over 60 years in the music business, Holzman spoke with the passion and spirit of someone who has just gotten started. A self-proclaimed autodidact, Holzman built Elektra\u2019s catalog by going to artists\u2019 homes with a tape recorder, and recording them himself. \u201cAutodidacts are so in love with life and so in love with what they do, that they want to wrap themselves in it, and that\u2019s what I wanted to do. I learned more and more, I got better at it, and I got smarter.\u201d Galdston emphasized that Holzman discovered artists, pursued the artists, and engineered and produced the records \u2013 something that most executives today cannot do. Perhaps the most understated takeaway from the evening was how Holzman and Galdston\u2019s conversation revolved around the music itself. Holzman maintains that artists are the most important part of a record label, and advised, \u201cif you take care of the music, the music will take care of you.\u201d   In 2013 Holzman launched the Doors app when he concluded that box sets had no place in the digital world. Holzman summarized the app\u2019s 16-month development process as \u201cthe most pain and the most fun\u201d he has ever had. With 1600 discrete items, it is the most comprehensive and fully interactive music app ever. Made with help from his family, the app is designed to test new approaches to digital music presentation, production techniques and the economics of pricing, marketing effectiveness, and the optimization and monetization of a product that offers unparalleled value through its ability to upgrade content and navigation.   Holzman left the audience with an invigorating reminder. \u201cI\u2019m not in the music business. I\u2019m in music.\u201d At the end of the conversation, Student Ambassador Board members Julia Pernicone (UG \u201915) and Suzanne Rollins (G \u201914) presented Holzman with the Visionary Award.

They are often viewed as underground artists at first, until they prove their \u201cworth.\u201d In the past, we have had similar artists sporadically spring up and adapt well to a competitive environment. Picasso, for example, defined himself as an artist of disfigured images, but he also had his \u201cBlue Phase\u201d during which he expressed a more realistic interpretation of the world. He was careful to separate his phases though. Such artists are like chameleons of the music world, able to change \u201ccolors\u201d &#8212; or overall image/sound/style &#8212; when necessary, but retaining a certain image long enough to produce a high level of success and survival. One such modern artist is the musician named George Barbera. He is a conglomeration of a music producer, a skilled multi-instrumentalist, a singer and songwriter, and a composer of various genres. George has formed a small community around himself to help with distributing his music which he puts together all in his bedroom studio. He mimics the efforts of Macklemore to get his music out to people without using a major record label which would infringe on his artistic freedom. The one obstacle which he is facing is how to convince consumers that his ability to be varying in musical creations and looks is what distinguishes him and makes his music valuable. The idea is far ahead of its time as people are so programmed to see brands as valuable, and yet at the same time they are exhibiting signs of boredom in the branding and formulating of music. George Barbera, therefore, in recognizing this obstacle is working on phasing his artistic creations and choosing to present to consumer one \u201ccolor\u201d at a time.   His first \u201ccolor\u201d is Sahara, a single from his band George and the Barbarian\u2019s debut album which is yet to be completed and released. The song is a metal rock song that mixes with an 80\u2019s rock theme. It is expected to be live on iTunes in three to five weeks, but in the meantime it can be viewed on Soundcloud . Check out this song which represents the sound of his band! All the instrumentals, vocals, the composition, and the production of the song were done by George Barbera showing off his all-compassing musical abilities. If you want to see some of George\u2019s other \u201ccolors\u201d check out the other songs on his Soundcloud or visit his Facebook page.   George Barbera&#8217;s music encompasses music&#8217;s evolutionary growth. Just as with organisms on earth, music has evolved. According to neuroscientist Steven Brown, music may have originated as a ritual\u2019s reward system which worked as a cooperative device that enabled the individual costs of producing music to be outweighed by the group survival benefits. Furthermore, it is believed that polyphony (different harmony lines not carried out in unison) predated monophony (harmony lines carried out in unison) implying that \u201ccontagious heterophony\u201d was a precursor to human music and speech. \u201cContagious heterophony\u201d can be found in the howling of wolves. The howls are sequenced and, therefore, do not occur together. Such blending of voices was used to establish group identity, and group communication to solidify social order and teamwork. Thus, the blending of voices was the first step in vocalization which led to both speech and harmonic constructions for the purpose of making music. As humanity entered the world, the complexity of music increased both in intellectual meaning and actual structure. Unison of voices in time and pitch developed, strengthening the idea of unity amongst community. Cycles of polyphonic and monophonic music were incorporated into human cultures with time. New ideas and combinations of old ideas transformed music even more. But still the main purpose to form community remained intact in the music of humans.   In our world today, however, money has become such a huge focus of music\u2019s purpose. This has taken music away, in some part, from its intrinsic communicative element. In order to market to large masses of people, rather than smaller communities, companies have forced artists to become more like a machine; and songs more like products to be mass produced. The problem with marketing an artist is that you often times must brand that artist, give the artist a look, a genre they excel in, a name that brings to mind a certain image to consumers. But all this labeling and defining of the artist limits the artist\u2019s ability to create and takes away a vital part of the freedom of human communication. The artist must limit what he/she puts into his/her music and cannot express the varying parts of him/herself. If the artist expresses too many different styles, consumers find it hard to distinguish the artist and therefore do not value him/her. While initially distinguishing an artist was important to convey to people that the artist was special, a leader of some sort, the ways artists are distinguished has become so formulated and applied to all artists, that artists are becoming less and less distinguished from each other. Music has become less valued as a result and music companies have been suffering. This has led to heightened competition and a need to adapt.   So where does all this leave artists today? Do they have a future? I predict that the new artist will be what I call the \u201call-encompassing\u201d artist. This artist is one who is able to do a lot of the work him/herself that major labels have been doing. In having this ability, the artist will be able to escape the formalization and mechanization that music companies have been forcing on artists. Furthermore, the \u201call-encompassing\u201d artist will have the ability to reflect a variety of human communication, changing up styles, looks, etc; and this will be the new distinguishing factor. However, what is important for such an artist, is that he/she recognize the need for organizing these phases of varying creativity; the artist needs a balance between free creativity and ordered marketing. Perhaps, the artist will also return to methods more in tune with music\u2019s origin and join small groups of like-minded people to form a community that will help with the extra responsibilities formerly executed by major record companies. This is the only way I see music continuing in its healthy evolutionary growth, while still retaining its intrinsic purpose of strengthening community and reflecting the society and species from which it comes. And it just so happens that George Barbera is an &#8220;all-encompassing&#8221; artist.   Eskew is a first year Music Business graduate student. In undergrad, she double majored in music and math.
