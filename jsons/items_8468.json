Six percent of students will end up at one of the city\u2019s eight specialized high schools, known for their elite academics\u2014and controversy around their lack of diversity. Female and, most starkly, Black and Latino students are all underrepresented at the schools.   A new report from the Research Alliance for New York City Schools examines students\u2019 pathways from middle school to matriculation at a specialized high school, and simulates the effects of various admissions criteria that have been proposed as alternatives to the current policy \u2013 which uses students\u2019 performance on the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) as the sole determinant of admission.   The study found that admissions rules based on criteria other than the SHSAT \u2013 including state test scores, grades, and attendance \u2013 would moderately alter the demographic mix of the specialized schools without significantly lowering the academic achievement levels of incoming students. But the rules would not substantially improve the schools\u2019 diversity, particularly for Black students, whose numbers would actually decrease under several of the proposed rules.   \u201cWhile there is a clear pattern of unequal access at the specialized schools, our findings suggest that a narrow focus on the SHSAT is unlikely to solve the problem,\u201d said Sean Corcoran , associate professor of educational economics at NYU\u2019s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the report\u2019s author. \u201cUnfortunately, the disparities at these schools are symptomatic of larger, system-wide achievement gaps.\u201d   In a typical year, about 25,000 of New York City\u2019s 80,000 eighth graders take the SHSAT, and 5,000 are offered admission to a specialized high school. In their study, Corcoran and coauthor Christine Baker-Smith sought to understand what role the SHSAT plays in racial and gender disparities at specialized high schools. Analyzing data from 2005 to 2013, they found that while the SHSAT is (by design) the single most important factor determining who attends the specialized high schools, it is not the only factor. Many students\u2014including many high-achieving students\u2014do not take the SHSAT at all, and some of those offered admission decide to go to high school elsewhere.   Even when comparing students with the same level of prior academic achievement (based on seventh grade New York State English language arts and math tests), the researchers documented disparities at each stage of the pathway into a specialized school:     Application : Girls, students eligible for free lunch, and Latino students were less likely to take the SHSAT; Asian students were substantially more likely to take the test.   Admission : Girls, students eligible for free lunch, and Latino and Black students were all less likely to receive an offer of admission, while Asian students were more likely to receive an offer.   Accepting an offer : Girls who received an offer to attend a specialized school were less likely to accept it, while students eligible for free lunch and Asians students were more likely to accept an offer when given one.     \u201cOur analysis suggests there is room to increase the number of well-qualified students who successfully navigate the pathway into a specialized school,\u201d said Corcoran. \u201cStrategies that encourage top students to take the test, for example, or provide high-quality SHSAT preparation hold promise for improving access.\u201d   The researchers also noted that more than half of students admitted to a specialized high school came from just 5 percent of the city\u2019s middle schools. However, when controlling for students\u2019 prior achievement, the middle schools that students attended had little effect on their likelihood of admission to a specialized school. This suggests that the concentration of offers in a small number of middle schools is less about the schools themselves and more about the uneven distribution of students across the system\u2014that is, the sorting of higher- and lower-achieving students that takes place before they get to middle school.   Critics of SHSAT-only admissions have offered ideas for different admissions criteria, and selective high schools in other cities use a variety of rules to admit students. But little information exists about how proposed changes would affect New York\u2019s specialized high schools. To address this, Corcoran and Baker-Smith simulated what would happen if new admissions criteria were in place, in lieu of the SHSAT. Key findings include:     Admissions based on state test scores, grades, and attendance would increase the share of Latino and White students and reduce the share of Asian students, but generally would not increase the share of Black students admitted. The same admissions criteria would tip the gender balance in favor of female students.   More than half of the students who would receive offers based on state test scores, grades, and attendance would also be admitted based on SHSAT scores, suggesting that there is considerable overlap among students who would be admitted under existing and proposed criteria.   The only simulated admissions rule that substantially changed the demographic mix of specialized high schools was guaranteed admission to all New York City students in the top 10 percent of their middle school. While this would have a large impact on diversity, it would also reduce the average academic achievement of incoming students, particularly in math.     \u201cThe real take-away here is that the lack of diversity in the specialized schools is a much bigger problem than \u2018to test or not to test?\u2019\u201d said James Kemple , the Research Alliance\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe need to think more broadly about how to reduce inequality in New York City\u2019s schools \u2013 identifying strategies that create opportunities for traditionally disadvantaged students will be a primary focus of the Research Alliance\u2019s work in coming years.\u201d   Click here to access Pathways to an Elite Education: Exploring Strategies to Diversify NYC\u2019s Specialized High Schools .

Six percent of students will end up at one of the city\u2019s eight specialized high schools, known for their elite academics\u2014and controversy around their lack of diversity. Female and, most starkly, Black and Latino students are all underrepresented at the schools.   A new report from the Research Alliance for New York City Schools examines students\u2019 pathways from middle school to matriculation at a specialized high school, and simulates the effects of various admissions criteria that have been proposed as alternatives to the current policy \u2013 which uses students\u2019 performance on the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) as the sole determinant of admission.   The study found that admissions rules based on criteria other than the SHSAT \u2013 including state test scores, grades, and attendance \u2013 would moderately alter the demographic mix of the specialized schools without significantly lowering the academic achievement levels of incoming students. But the rules would not substantially improve the schools\u2019 diversity, particularly for Black students, whose numbers would actually decrease under several of the proposed rules.   \u201cWhile there is a clear pattern of unequal access at the specialized schools, our findings suggest that a narrow focus on the SHSAT is unlikely to solve the problem,\u201d said Sean Corcoran , associate professor of educational economics at NYU\u2019s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development and the report\u2019s author. \u201cUnfortunately, the disparities at these schools are symptomatic of larger, system-wide achievement gaps.\u201d   In a typical year, about 25,000 of New York City\u2019s 80,000 eighth graders take the SHSAT, and 5,000 are offered admission to a specialized high school. In their study, Corcoran and coauthor Christine Baker-Smith sought to understand what role the SHSAT plays in racial and gender disparities at specialized high schools. Analyzing data from 2005 to 2013, they found that while the SHSAT is (by design) the single most important factor determining who attends the specialized high schools, it is not the only factor. Many students\u2014including many high-achieving students\u2014do not take the SHSAT at all, and some of those offered admission decide to go to high school elsewhere.   Even when comparing students with the same level of prior academic achievement (based on seventh grade New York State English language arts and math tests), the researchers documented disparities at each stage of the pathway into a specialized school:     Application : Girls, students eligible for free lunch, and Latino students were less likely to take the SHSAT; Asian students were substantially more likely to take the test.   Admission : Girls, students eligible for free lunch, and Latino and Black students were all less likely to receive an offer of admission, while Asian students were more likely to receive an offer.   Accepting an offer : Girls who received an offer to attend a specialized school were less likely to accept it, while students eligible for free lunch and Asians students were more likely to accept an offer when given one.     \u201cOur analysis suggests there is room to increase the number of well-qualified students who successfully navigate the pathway into a specialized school,\u201d said Corcoran. \u201cStrategies that encourage top students to take the test, for example, or provide high-quality SHSAT preparation hold promise for improving access.\u201d   The researchers also noted that more than half of students admitted to a specialized high school came from just 5 percent of the city\u2019s middle schools. However, when controlling for students\u2019 prior achievement, the middle schools that students attended had little effect on their likelihood of admission to a specialized school. This suggests that the concentration of offers in a small number of middle schools is less about the schools themselves and more about the uneven distribution of students across the system\u2014that is, the sorting of higher- and lower-achieving students that takes place before they get to middle school.   Critics of SHSAT-only admissions have offered ideas for different admissions criteria, and selective high schools in other cities use a variety of rules to admit students. But little information exists about how proposed changes would affect New York\u2019s specialized high schools. To address this, Corcoran and Baker-Smith simulated what would happen if new admissions criteria were in place, in lieu of the SHSAT. Key findings include:     Admissions based on state test scores, grades, and attendance would increase the share of Latino and White students and reduce the share of Asian students, but generally would not increase the share of Black students admitted. The same admissions criteria would tip the gender balance in favor of female students.   More than half of the students who would receive offers based on state test scores, grades, and attendance would also be admitted based on SHSAT scores, suggesting that there is considerable overlap among students who would be admitted under existing and proposed criteria.   The only simulated admissions rule that substantially changed the demographic mix of specialized high schools was guaranteed admission to all New York City students in the top 10 percent of their middle school. While this would have a large impact on diversity, it would also reduce the average academic achievement of incoming students, particularly in math.     \u201cThe real take-away here is that the lack of diversity in the specialized schools is a much bigger problem than \u2018to test or not to test?\u2019\u201d said James Kemple , the Research Alliance\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe need to think more broadly about how to reduce inequality in New York City\u2019s schools \u2013 identifying strategies that create opportunities for traditionally disadvantaged students will be a primary focus of the Research Alliance\u2019s work in coming years.\u201d   Click here to access Pathways to an Elite Education: Exploring Strategies to Diversify NYC\u2019s Specialized High Schools .

Through a series of regular meetings and occasional public events, we will engage emerging debates about cities and sustainability, the cultural politics of environmentalism, the possibilities for green design, the challenge of remaking infrastructure, and the problem of climate change governance. The complex nature of the issue and its impact necessitates a broad, interdisciplinary conversation between scholars across the social sciences, humanities, and professional schools, including fields built around design.    The discussion we envision is also a global one: we welcome scholars working in and across different world regions. The nature of the issue challenges traditional divisions between Global North and Global South but also calls for depth of contextual knowledge. To this end, IPK will\u00a0provide logistical assistance, meeting space, some funding and assistance in seeking external funds as appropriate\u00a0to share work in progress on subjects such as:\u00a0    -Cities and Climate Change    -Democratizing the Green City    -Critical Infrastructures    -Green Design                                                                                           Organizers                                                             Eric Klinenberg    Director at IPK, Professor of Sociology at NYU    Gianpaolo Baiocchi    Senior Fellow at IPK, Associate Professor of Sociology at NYU    Hilary Angelo    PhD Candidate, Sociology at NYU    Daniel Aldana Cohen    PhD Candidate, Sociology at NYU                                                                                                                                                 Members                                                             Jessica Coffey    Assistant Director, Institute for Public Knowledge    Tara Eisenberg    Research Coordinator, Rebuild by Design    Natalie Jeremijenko    Associate Professor, Visual Art at NYU    Colin Jerolmack    Assistant Professor, Sociology at NYU    Liz Koslov    PhD Candidate, Media, Culture & Communication at NYU    Ben Mendelsohn    PhD Candidate, Media, Culture & Communication at NYU    Nick Mirzoeff    Professor of Media, Culture & Communication at NYU    Harvey Molotch    Professor of Social & Cultural Analysis and Sociology at NYU    Andrew Ross    Professor of Social & Cultural Analysis at NYU                                                                                                                                                            &copy; 2015 Institute for Public Knowledge | 20 Cooper Square, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10003   Login Email Preferences Contact Us"}]}]
