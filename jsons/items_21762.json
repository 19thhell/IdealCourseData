Ruzzene   Program Director   Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI)   National Science Foundation   The talk will provide a quick overview of the Sensors, Dynamics and Control program, its goals, its funding levels and its priorities. In addition, the program presentation will provide the opportunity to provide advice and general suggestions regarding proposal writing and submission, and general interactions between NSF and the scientific community it aims to serve.   The SDC program supports fundamental research on the analysis, measurement, monitoring and control of dynamic systems, including development of new analytical, computational and experimental tools, and novel applications to engineered and natural systems. Dynamics is the science of systems that change in time. Control concerns the use of external influences to produce desired dynamic behaviors. Diagnostics concerns the use of observation to infer information about a dynamic system. Objectives of the DCD program are the discovery of new phenomena and the investigation of innovative methods and applications in dynamics, control and diagnostics. The intellectual merit of proposals submitted to the DCD program will be evaluated on the basis of fundamental innovation in foundational areas, on alignment with the core disciplines of the CMMI Division, and on potential for transformative impact within and across disciplinary boundaries.   Research topics of current interest include, but are not limited to, complex dynamical and structural systems; fundamental studies on stability, phase transitions, and wave propagation in complex and non-local media; integrity monitoring, reliability and safety of complex or stochastic engineered systems; unconventional applications of control; control of complex, distributed, interconnected and/or constrained systems; and control concepts inspired by nature.   ________________________________________   Biosketch   Massimo Ruzzene is a Professor in the Schools of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. He received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the Politecnico di Torino (Italy) in 1999. He is author of 2 bookes, 130 journal papers and about 170 conference papers. He has participated as a PI or co-PI in various research projects funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Army Research Office (ARO), the Office of Naval Research (ONR), NASA, the US Army, US Navy, DARPA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), as well as companies such as Boeing, Eurocopter, Raytheon, Corning and TRW. Most of his current and past research work has focused on solid mechanics, structural dynamics and wave propagation with application to structural health monitoring, metamaterials, and vibration and noise control. M. Ruzzene is a Fellow of ASME, an Associate Fellow of AIAA, and a member of AHS, and ASA. He is the program director for the Sensors, Dynamics and Control Program of CMMI at NSF.
