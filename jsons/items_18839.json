Nepal Earthquake Disaster Email Scams (Alert)   In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Nepal, just like major disasters before it, human nature is often at its best, but for some, it is at its worst. Following major disasters, scammers usually send out floods of email in an attempt to either solicit donations for fake charities, or else to lure users into clicking links containing malware or responding to phishing attempts.

Nepal Earthquake Disaster Email Scams (Alert)   In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake in Nepal, just like major disasters before it, human nature is often at its best, but for some, it is at its worst. Following major disasters, scammers usually send out floods of email in an attempt to either solicit donations for fake charities, or else to lure users into clicking links containing malware or responding to phishing attempts. NYU encourages users to take the measures to protect themselves; click the \"More\" link for detailed recommendations. | More      Recent ITS News and Alerts        New Articles on a New Connect      Nominate a Student for a $500 NYU IT Computing Prize      A Note On Illegal Downloading           Recent Computer Security Alerts        Nepal Earthquake Disaster Email Scams (Alert)      Microsoft Security Vulnerabilities      TA15-051A: Lenovo Superfish Adware Vulnerable to HTTPS Spoofing           &raquo; All News and Alerts                                       About ITS                              Get Connected                               Communicate & Collaborate                               Help & Support                                 Computer Security                               Instruction & Research                               Locations & Facilities                                                           ITS Quick Links         Connect: IT at NYU        IT Service Catalog        ITS Policies &amp; Guidance        Mobile Device Support         NetID and password        NYURoam Wireless        NYU Calendar        NYU Classes        NYU Email        NYU Google Apps        NYU Start page         Remote Instruction Support         ResNet         ServiceLink        Training & workshops                                Notices &amp; Alerts        IT Service Status        ITS News &amp; Security Alerts        NYU Info Alert Page        BobCat                             NYU IT Resources        NYUHome        Main NYU Site        NYU Libraries        NYU Computer Store        NYU Mobile App        Digital Communications        Law IT Services        Stern IT Services                                Ask ITS      ITS is here to help!
