After setup, you'll be able to use NYURoam anywhere else it's offered without having to reconfigure or adjust anything.   The ITS website offers extensive information on getting going:   Computer Requirements   How to Set Things Up   Available Locations   Workshops and Other Help   Please keep in mind that the service is run and supported by ITS, not the journalism department, so if you have any issues you'll need to contact them .   Field Equipment Policy   The department's currently stated policy governing the lending of field equipment to those qualified (by virtue of course enrollment) to borrow video/audio gear. Please review this information carefully - you will be held accountable for all borrowed equipment based on the dictates of this policy.   Institute Guidelines for Field Equipment Purchases   The NYU Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute provides guidelines for students interested in purchasing their own field equipment.  All the items on this list are compatible with the equipment that the Institute currently checks out to students.  The list will be updated periodically.

Also, beware the many, many websites out there offering huge discounts on cameras. These usually offer \u201cgrey market\u201d cameras, which means they are likely bought in foreign markets (eg. Asia) and will require all kinds of adapters and most of these won\u2019t come with a U.S. warranty. Buy at your own risk.   Second: Get a lens cleaning kit (amazing how much this can help video quality!) and a tripod. A case is optional. I throw my small camcorder in my knapsack or even my purse.   Consumer Camcorders   To produce video for the web, all you will need is a consumer camcorder or handycam . Most models are extremely portable, fitting in the palm of your hand, and can capture adequate video and adequate sound\u2014the colors won\u2019t be as vibrant as you\u2019re used to seeing on TV, and most models won\u2019t have a microphone jack, so in order to record sound bites, you\u2019ll have to rely on the built-in mic, meaning your sound won\u2019t be the best. Most models, if not all, now come with built-in digital still camera for point-and-shoot pictures you can then post on the web.   Panasonic, Sony, Canon and Samsung all make suitable consumer camcorders and are readily available at BestBuy , B&amp;H or J&amp;R . As for the recording format, I would recommend mini-DV, as opposed to a DVD or the HD (hard disk) variety. The prices should all be comparable, and definitely below $400, with some exceptions. Mini-DV, which is the format we use at NY1 (mostly) and at NYU, is cheap, small, readily available (you can buy mini DV tapes at a drug store), with less risk of erasing it (unlike HD) or damaging it (like DVD), and they are very high quality.   Here are some examples of value-for-money camcorders in this category ( Note: prices fluctuate constantly\u2014these are as of June 2007 ):   Panasonic PV-GS85 Ultra Compact Mini DV ( $279.95 at B&amp;H )   Indicated for use as webcam. Can take stills. Has USB, which means simple to connect to computer. Has cool digital effects.   Canon ZR-800 Mini DV Camcorder ( $249 at B&amp;H )   Part of Canon\u2019s entry-level ZR series. Captures stills. Good images, great lens, great zoom, easy-to-use, very pretty. Bonus: has an external mic. Do not confuse with ZR-830 or ZR-850 which do not have an external mic, despite having a few other bells and whistles.   Sony DCR-HC28, DCR-HC38, DCR-HC48 Mini DV Camcorder ( $249.95 to $339 at B&amp;H )   Has advance HAD-CCD, which is one step up from CCD, providing great detail and clarity. But, still has no external mic or headphone jack.   Sony DCR-HC96 Mini DV Camcorder ( $549.95 at B&amp;H )   Has same advance HAD-CCD of earlier models, but this one also has a mic input.   Samsung SC-D6550 Mini DV Camcorder ( $299.95 at B&amp;H )   Has mic input jack. Not the prettiest of camcorders. Has two separate lenses for video and still, giving it high-quality video and still.   Prosumer Camcorders   For the super-ambitious, looking to submit stories for stations like Current TV or even those looking to do some freelancing for a news website with a video component, I would recommend taking the plunge, spending the extra cash and getting a prosumer ( professional/consumer ) camera.   Unlike consumer camcorders, or one-chip cameras, a prosumer camera or three-chip, can capture better image and color depth. These 3CCD cameras have three separate chips to capture visual data: one for red, one for green and one for blue (all the colors of the spectrum) as opposed to the consumer cameras that have to capture the data all on one chip.   Higher-quality models will also have a microphone jack in the form of a little 1/4 inch or mini plug. These still won\u2019t give you broadcast quality sound, which requires a XLR cable (three-pronged \u2013 super expensive), but the external mic will at least help you capture better sound bites than just using the camera mic. Best case scenario, you\u2019ll get a model with a headphone jack, too, so that you can monitor sound while recording and in playback, in addition to monitoring sound levels on the camera.   Once again, I would recommend the mini-DV recording format. There\u2019s plenty of options in this category. Here are some examples, below:   Panasonic PV-G320 3 CCD Mini-DV Camcorder ( $429.95 at B&amp;H )   This is on the lower-end of the 3CCD scale. Doesn\u2019t have external mic jack (boohoo), but does have stereo zoom mic with wind noise reduction.   Panasonic PV-GS500 3 CCD Mini-DV Camcorder ( $799.95 at B&amp;H )   A step up from the GS320 and worth the extra dough, because you get an external mic jack, (though no headphone jack) and this has good low-light performance and very good natural light video \u2013 plus it has a manual focus ring, which most consumer and prosumer cameras don\u2019t have anymore. The viewfinder also pulls out and flips up, which is a huge plus.   Sony HDR-HC5 HDV Camcorder ( $749.95 after rebate at B&amp;H )   No mic or headphone jack, but this has the option of shooting in high-definition video (HDV), which is where broadcasters are headed. Not worth the extra cost for the most part, but if you are crazy about HDV, then by all means, this is a great camera.   Sony HDR-HC7 HDV Camcorder ( $999.95 after rebate at B&amp;H )   Step up from HDR-HC5 \u2013 has both mic and headphone jack. If you are going to spend all that money for HDV, then you might as well blow the bank on this one.   \u2014Darragh Worland                                           Arthur L.

The studio is equipped with 4 cameras, 3 Hitachi Z4000W digital studio cameras with teleprompter system and a ceiling mounted remote camera.   The newly-designed set has a mobile news desk, an interview area for use by the many classes that invite guests to the department and a chroma key green screen for superimposition of images.   The set was designed by PDG, one of the top design firms in New York and reflects downtown Manhattan and the complex creative congestion of the city. The studio also has smaller backgrounds for interviewing individuals for documentaries.   A retractable screen and speaker system for screenings in the studio is also available.   Control Room   The spacious control room is equipped with digital switcher, a MACKIE 16-8 audio board, a COMREX phone system for on-air call-ins, a Lyric 5.24 Chyron graphics station, Scan-Do system and an EXPRESS 24/48 lighting board.   Communication between the control room crew, the studio crew and the media room is made possible by a RTS TELEX intercom system.   Media Room   The media room components are fully routable and allow playback and recording from and to 2 AVID airspeed units and various digital and analog playback and recording sources.   The media room is also equipped to receive and record the CNN Pathfire feeds and to stream the studio programs, such as TV newscasts and live guest speaker-driven events, to the Web.   Video Editing   We are running Adobe CC Suite on all our Apple computers and we also have two AVID MC stations for students who would like to learn Avid.   Field TV Production Equipment   A range of equipment is available to suit different levels of media production. For News and Documentary students, the department provides various cameras and audio recorders (Panasonic AG-AC90, JVC GYHM-100, Panasonic GH3, Canon T4i and Zoom H4N) Lectrosonics and Sony radio mics and professional Lowell lighting kits for their documentary productions.   For multimedia students, the department provides small, easy-to-use Canon Vixia cameras and microphones.   Radio Studio   The state-of-the-art radio studio can support three guests and a host for live and taped talk shows for WNYU and our website. It has an 18-input Audio Arts Digital Engineering broadcast control console, 4 Neumann microphones, a Comtrex Gentner telco system for live call-ins and three Shortcut 360 digital editing systems.   The radio studio is available to all journalism students. It is also connected to the Radio Newsroom so classes can view and listen to live and recorded productions during class   Sound Booth   Adjacent to the Radio Studio is the Sound Booth. It serves the needs of radio and video. It is wired directly into the radio board, but students working in video can use it to record narration onto CFII flash cards, SD cards and jump drives.   Radio Field Equipment   Journalism students are exposed to a variety of recording devices that are used in the industry and can check out Zoom H4N audio recorders.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

After setup, you'll be able to use NYURoam anywhere else it's offered without having to reconfigure or adjust anything.   The ITS website offers extensive information on getting going:   Computer Requirements   How to Set Things Up   Available Locations   Workshops and Other Help   Please keep in mind that the service is run and supported by ITS, not the journalism department, so if you have any issues you'll need to contact them .   Field Equipment Policy   The department's currently stated policy governing the lending of field equipment to those qualified (by virtue of course enrollment) to borrow video/audio gear. Please review this information carefully - you will be held accountable for all borrowed equipment based on the dictates of this policy.   Institute Guidelines for Field Equipment Purchases   The NYU Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute provides guidelines for students interested in purchasing their own field equipment.

Also, beware the many, many websites out there offering huge discounts on cameras. These usually offer \u201cgrey market\u201d cameras, which means they are likely bought in foreign markets (eg. Asia) and will require all kinds of adapters and most of these won\u2019t come with a U.S. warranty. Buy at your own risk.   Second: Get a lens cleaning kit (amazing how much this can help video quality!) and a tripod. A case is optional. I throw my small camcorder in my knapsack or even my purse.   Consumer Camcorders   To produce video for the web, all you will need is a consumer camcorder or handycam . Most models are extremely portable, fitting in the palm of your hand, and can capture adequate video and adequate sound\u2014the colors won\u2019t be as vibrant as you\u2019re used to seeing on TV, and most models won\u2019t have a microphone jack, so in order to record sound bites, you\u2019ll have to rely on the built-in mic, meaning your sound won\u2019t be the best. Most models, if not all, now come with built-in digital still camera for point-and-shoot pictures you can then post on the web.   Panasonic, Sony, Canon and Samsung all make suitable consumer camcorders and are readily available at BestBuy , B&amp;H or J&amp;R . As for the recording format, I would recommend mini-DV, as opposed to a DVD or the HD (hard disk) variety. The prices should all be comparable, and definitely below $400, with some exceptions. Mini-DV, which is the format we use at NY1 (mostly) and at NYU, is cheap, small, readily available (you can buy mini DV tapes at a drug store), with less risk of erasing it (unlike HD) or damaging it (like DVD), and they are very high quality.   Here are some examples of value-for-money camcorders in this category ( Note: prices fluctuate constantly\u2014these are as of June 2007 ):   Panasonic PV-GS85 Ultra Compact Mini DV ( $279.95 at B&amp;H )   Indicated for use as webcam. Can take stills. Has USB, which means simple to connect to computer. Has cool digital effects.   Canon ZR-800 Mini DV Camcorder ( $249 at B&amp;H )   Part of Canon\u2019s entry-level ZR series. Captures stills. Good images, great lens, great zoom, easy-to-use, very pretty. Bonus: has an external mic. Do not confuse with ZR-830 or ZR-850 which do not have an external mic, despite having a few other bells and whistles.   Sony DCR-HC28, DCR-HC38, DCR-HC48 Mini DV Camcorder ( $249.95 to $339 at B&amp;H )   Has advance HAD-CCD, which is one step up from CCD, providing great detail and clarity. But, still has no external mic or headphone jack.   Sony DCR-HC96 Mini DV Camcorder ( $549.95 at B&amp;H )   Has same advance HAD-CCD of earlier models, but this one also has a mic input.   Samsung SC-D6550 Mini DV Camcorder ( $299.95 at B&amp;H )   Has mic input jack. Not the prettiest of camcorders. Has two separate lenses for video and still, giving it high-quality video and still.   Prosumer Camcorders   For the super-ambitious, looking to submit stories for stations like Current TV or even those looking to do some freelancing for a news website with a video component, I would recommend taking the plunge, spending the extra cash and getting a prosumer ( professional/consumer ) camera.   Unlike consumer camcorders, or one-chip cameras, a prosumer camera or three-chip, can capture better image and color depth. These 3CCD cameras have three separate chips to capture visual data: one for red, one for green and one for blue (all the colors of the spectrum) as opposed to the consumer cameras that have to capture the data all on one chip.   Higher-quality models will also have a microphone jack in the form of a little 1/4 inch or mini plug. These still won\u2019t give you broadcast quality sound, which requires a XLR cable (three-pronged \u2013 super expensive), but the external mic will at least help you capture better sound bites than just using the camera mic. Best case scenario, you\u2019ll get a model with a headphone jack, too, so that you can monitor sound while recording and in playback, in addition to monitoring sound levels on the camera.   Once again, I would recommend the mini-DV recording format. There\u2019s plenty of options in this category. Here are some examples, below:   Panasonic PV-G320 3 CCD Mini-DV Camcorder ( $429.95 at B&amp;H )   This is on the lower-end of the 3CCD scale. Doesn\u2019t have external mic jack (boohoo), but does have stereo zoom mic with wind noise reduction.   Panasonic PV-GS500 3 CCD Mini-DV Camcorder ( $799.95 at B&amp;H )   A step up from the GS320 and worth the extra dough, because you get an external mic jack, (though no headphone jack) and this has good low-light performance and very good natural light video \u2013 plus it has a manual focus ring, which most consumer and prosumer cameras don\u2019t have anymore. The viewfinder also pulls out and flips up, which is a huge plus.   Sony HDR-HC5 HDV Camcorder ( $749.95 after rebate at B&amp;H )   No mic or headphone jack, but this has the option of shooting in high-definition video (HDV), which is where broadcasters are headed. Not worth the extra cost for the most part, but if you are crazy about HDV, then by all means, this is a great camera.   Sony HDR-HC7 HDV Camcorder ( $999.95 after rebate at B&amp;H )   Step up from HDR-HC5 \u2013 has both mic and headphone jack. If you are going to spend all that money for HDV, then you might as well blow the bank on this one.   \u2014Darragh Worland                                           Arthur L.

The studio is equipped with 4 cameras, 3 Hitachi Z4000W digital studio cameras with teleprompter system and a ceiling mounted remote camera.   The newly-designed set has a mobile news desk, an interview area for use by the many classes that invite guests to the department and a chroma key green screen for superimposition of images.   The set was designed by PDG, one of the top design firms in New York and reflects downtown Manhattan and the complex creative congestion of the city. The studio also has smaller backgrounds for interviewing individuals for documentaries.   A retractable screen and speaker system for screenings in the studio is also available.   Control Room   The spacious control room is equipped with digital switcher, a MACKIE 16-8 audio board, a COMREX phone system for on-air call-ins, a Lyric 5.24 Chyron graphics station, Scan-Do system and an EXPRESS 24/48 lighting board.   Communication between the control room crew, the studio crew and the media room is made possible by a RTS TELEX intercom system.   Media Room   The media room components are fully routable and allow playback and recording from and to 2 AVID airspeed units and various digital and analog playback and recording sources.   The media room is also equipped to receive and record the CNN Pathfire feeds and to stream the studio programs, such as TV newscasts and live guest speaker-driven events, to the Web.   Video Editing   We are running Adobe CC Suite on all our Apple computers and we also have two AVID MC stations for students who would like to learn Avid.   Field TV Production Equipment   A range of equipment is available to suit different levels of media production. For News and Documentary students, the department provides various cameras and audio recorders (Panasonic AG-AC90, JVC GYHM-100, Panasonic GH3, Canon T4i and Zoom H4N) Lectrosonics and Sony radio mics and professional Lowell lighting kits for their documentary productions.   For multimedia students, the department provides small, easy-to-use Canon Vixia cameras and microphones.   Radio Studio   The state-of-the-art radio studio can support three guests and a host for live and taped talk shows for WNYU and our website. It has an 18-input Audio Arts Digital Engineering broadcast control console, 4 Neumann microphones, a Comtrex Gentner telco system for live call-ins and three Shortcut 360 digital editing systems.   The radio studio is available to all journalism students. It is also connected to the Radio Newsroom so classes can view and listen to live and recorded productions during class   Sound Booth   Adjacent to the Radio Studio is the Sound Booth. It serves the needs of radio and video. It is wired directly into the radio board, but students working in video can use it to record narration onto CFII flash cards, SD cards and jump drives.   Radio Field Equipment   Journalism students are exposed to a variety of recording devices that are used in the industry and can check out Zoom H4N audio recorders.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.

After setup, you'll be able to use NYURoam anywhere else it's offered without having to reconfigure or adjust anything.   The ITS website offers extensive information on getting going:   Computer Requirements   How to Set Things Up   Available Locations   Workshops and Other Help   Please keep in mind that the service is run and supported by ITS, not the journalism department, so if you have any issues you'll need to contact them .   Field Equipment Policy   The department's currently stated policy governing the lending of field equipment to those qualified (by virtue of course enrollment) to borrow video/audio gear. Please review this information carefully - you will be held accountable for all borrowed equipment based on the dictates of this policy.   Institute Guidelines for Field Equipment Purchases   The NYU Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute provides guidelines for students interested in purchasing their own field equipment.  All the items on this list are compatible with the equipment that the Institute currently checks out to students.  The list will be updated periodically.

Also, beware the many, many websites out there offering huge discounts on cameras. These usually offer \u201cgrey market\u201d cameras, which means they are likely bought in foreign markets (eg. Asia) and will require all kinds of adapters and most of these won\u2019t come with a U.S. warranty. Buy at your own risk.   Second: Get a lens cleaning kit (amazing how much this can help video quality!) and a tripod. A case is optional. I throw my small camcorder in my knapsack or even my purse.   Consumer Camcorders   To produce video for the web, all you will need is a consumer camcorder or handycam . Most models are extremely portable, fitting in the palm of your hand, and can capture adequate video and adequate sound\u2014the colors won\u2019t be as vibrant as you\u2019re used to seeing on TV, and most models won\u2019t have a microphone jack, so in order to record sound bites, you\u2019ll have to rely on the built-in mic, meaning your sound won\u2019t be the best. Most models, if not all, now come with built-in digital still camera for point-and-shoot pictures you can then post on the web.   Panasonic, Sony, Canon and Samsung all make suitable consumer camcorders and are readily available at BestBuy , B&amp;H or J&amp;R . As for the recording format, I would recommend mini-DV, as opposed to a DVD or the HD (hard disk) variety. The prices should all be comparable, and definitely below $400, with some exceptions. Mini-DV, which is the format we use at NY1 (mostly) and at NYU, is cheap, small, readily available (you can buy mini DV tapes at a drug store), with less risk of erasing it (unlike HD) or damaging it (like DVD), and they are very high quality.   Here are some examples of value-for-money camcorders in this category ( Note: prices fluctuate constantly\u2014these are as of June 2007 ):   Panasonic PV-GS85 Ultra Compact Mini DV ( $279.95 at B&amp;H )   Indicated for use as webcam. Can take stills. Has USB, which means simple to connect to computer. Has cool digital effects.   Canon ZR-800 Mini DV Camcorder ( $249 at B&amp;H )   Part of Canon\u2019s entry-level ZR series. Captures stills. Good images, great lens, great zoom, easy-to-use, very pretty. Bonus: has an external mic. Do not confuse with ZR-830 or ZR-850 which do not have an external mic, despite having a few other bells and whistles.   Sony DCR-HC28, DCR-HC38, DCR-HC48 Mini DV Camcorder ( $249.95 to $339 at B&amp;H )   Has advance HAD-CCD, which is one step up from CCD, providing great detail and clarity. But, still has no external mic or headphone jack.   Sony DCR-HC96 Mini DV Camcorder ( $549.95 at B&amp;H )   Has same advance HAD-CCD of earlier models, but this one also has a mic input.   Samsung SC-D6550 Mini DV Camcorder ( $299.95 at B&amp;H )   Has mic input jack. Not the prettiest of camcorders. Has two separate lenses for video and still, giving it high-quality video and still.   Prosumer Camcorders   For the super-ambitious, looking to submit stories for stations like Current TV or even those looking to do some freelancing for a news website with a video component, I would recommend taking the plunge, spending the extra cash and getting a prosumer ( professional/consumer ) camera.   Unlike consumer camcorders, or one-chip cameras, a prosumer camera or three-chip, can capture better image and color depth. These 3CCD cameras have three separate chips to capture visual data: one for red, one for green and one for blue (all the colors of the spectrum) as opposed to the consumer cameras that have to capture the data all on one chip.   Higher-quality models will also have a microphone jack in the form of a little 1/4 inch or mini plug. These still won\u2019t give you broadcast quality sound, which requires a XLR cable (three-pronged \u2013 super expensive), but the external mic will at least help you capture better sound bites than just using the camera mic. Best case scenario, you\u2019ll get a model with a headphone jack, too, so that you can monitor sound while recording and in playback, in addition to monitoring sound levels on the camera.   Once again, I would recommend the mini-DV recording format. There\u2019s plenty of options in this category. Here are some examples, below:   Panasonic PV-G320 3 CCD Mini-DV Camcorder ( $429.95 at B&amp;H )   This is on the lower-end of the 3CCD scale. Doesn\u2019t have external mic jack (boohoo), but does have stereo zoom mic with wind noise reduction.   Panasonic PV-GS500 3 CCD Mini-DV Camcorder ( $799.95 at B&amp;H )   A step up from the GS320 and worth the extra dough, because you get an external mic jack, (though no headphone jack) and this has good low-light performance and very good natural light video \u2013 plus it has a manual focus ring, which most consumer and prosumer cameras don\u2019t have anymore. The viewfinder also pulls out and flips up, which is a huge plus.   Sony HDR-HC5 HDV Camcorder ( $749.95 after rebate at B&amp;H )   No mic or headphone jack, but this has the option of shooting in high-definition video (HDV), which is where broadcasters are headed. Not worth the extra cost for the most part, but if you are crazy about HDV, then by all means, this is a great camera.   Sony HDR-HC7 HDV Camcorder ( $999.95 after rebate at B&amp;H )   Step up from HDR-HC5 \u2013 has both mic and headphone jack. If you are going to spend all that money for HDV, then you might as well blow the bank on this one.   \u2014Darragh Worland                                           Arthur L.

The studio is equipped with 4 cameras, 3 Hitachi Z4000W digital studio cameras with teleprompter system and a ceiling mounted remote camera.   The newly-designed set has a mobile news desk, an interview area for use by the many classes that invite guests to the department and a chroma key green screen for superimposition of images.   The set was designed by PDG, one of the top design firms in New York and reflects downtown Manhattan and the complex creative congestion of the city. The studio also has smaller backgrounds for interviewing individuals for documentaries.   A retractable screen and speaker system for screenings in the studio is also available.   Control Room   The spacious control room is equipped with digital switcher, a MACKIE 16-8 audio board, a COMREX phone system for on-air call-ins, a Lyric 5.24 Chyron graphics station, Scan-Do system and an EXPRESS 24/48 lighting board.   Communication between the control room crew, the studio crew and the media room is made possible by a RTS TELEX intercom system.   Media Room   The media room components are fully routable and allow playback and recording from and to 2 AVID airspeed units and various digital and analog playback and recording sources.   The media room is also equipped to receive and record the CNN Pathfire feeds and to stream the studio programs, such as TV newscasts and live guest speaker-driven events, to the Web.   Video Editing   We are running Adobe CC Suite on all our Apple computers and we also have two AVID MC stations for students who would like to learn Avid.   Field TV Production Equipment   A range of equipment is available to suit different levels of media production. For News and Documentary students, the department provides various cameras and audio recorders (Panasonic AG-AC90, JVC GYHM-100, Panasonic GH3, Canon T4i and Zoom H4N) Lectrosonics and Sony radio mics and professional Lowell lighting kits for their documentary productions.   For multimedia students, the department provides small, easy-to-use Canon Vixia cameras and microphones.   Radio Studio   The state-of-the-art radio studio can support three guests and a host for live and taped talk shows for WNYU and our website. It has an 18-input Audio Arts Digital Engineering broadcast control console, 4 Neumann microphones, a Comtrex Gentner telco system for live call-ins and three Shortcut 360 digital editing systems.   The radio studio is available to all journalism students. It is also connected to the Radio Newsroom so classes can view and listen to live and recorded productions during class   Sound Booth   Adjacent to the Radio Studio is the Sound Booth. It serves the needs of radio and video. It is wired directly into the radio board, but students working in video can use it to record narration onto CFII flash cards, SD cards and jump drives.   Radio Field Equipment   Journalism students are exposed to a variety of recording devices that are used in the industry and can check out Zoom H4N audio recorders.   \u00a0                                               Arthur L.
