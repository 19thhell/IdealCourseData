Welcome to New York University\u2019s Social Science Study Participation Database!                Thank you for exploring the possibility of participating in paid studies at New York University New York (NYUNYC) and Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). At NYU we have a large number of faculty, students and staff conducting research with human participants. The studies they work on cover a multitude of disciplines (such as economics, linguistics, or psychology to name just a few). The success of their work depends heavily upon the involvement of interested participants. For this reason we aim to build a directory of people interested in participating in research at NYU through this database.      Please use the links above to find out more about this study participation database. If you decide that you want to register for the study participation database, click here or use the \u2018Register\u2019 tab. Please note that registering merely means that researchers from NYU (i.e., faculty, staff and students) can invite you to participate in their paid studies. You are not registering for any specific study at this time and are under no obligation to accept any of the invitations send to you after registration. Put differently, you can say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 towards participating whenever contacted to be part of a study. By signing up for this database you are NOT giving up any rights. You only provide basic demographic and contact information that can be accessed by our researchers as they aim to recruit participants for their studies.      Please also note that all researchers who have access to the database conduct their studies in compliance with either the NYUNYC Human Subjects Research Committee or the NYUAD Research Participation Protection Program. The database will not be shared with people unaffiliated with NYU unless they are on a specific project and their involvement has been approved by NYU."}]}][{"detail": [{"content": "NYU Research Studies                                                                                                             Search                NYU Psychology     Programs     Courses     Research     Faculty     People     Events     Contacts     [Internal]                                                      Opportunities     Facilities     Recruit (Getting IRB Approval)     High school     Paid studies     Required     Parental permission                        NYU Research Studies (Paid)     These studies seek participants (subjects), and pay for your    time.

Welcome to New York University\u2019s Social Science Study Participation Database!                Thank you for exploring the possibility of participating in paid studies at New York University New York (NYUNYC) and Abu Dhabi (NYUAD). At NYU we have a large number of faculty, students and staff conducting research with human participants. The studies they work on cover a multitude of disciplines (such as economics, linguistics, or psychology to name just a few). The success of their work depends heavily upon the involvement of interested participants. For this reason we aim to build a directory of people interested in participating in research at NYU through this database.      Please use the links above to find out more about this study participation database. If you decide that you want to register for the study participation database, click here or use the \u2018Register\u2019 tab. Please note that registering merely means that researchers from NYU (i.e., faculty, staff and students) can invite you to participate in their paid studies. You are not registering for any specific study at this time and are under no obligation to accept any of the invitations send to you after registration. Put differently, you can say \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 towards participating whenever contacted to be part of a study. By signing up for this database you are NOT giving up any rights. You only provide basic demographic and contact information that can be accessed by our researchers as they aim to recruit participants for their studies.      Please also note that all researchers who have access to the database conduct their studies in compliance with either the NYUNYC Human Subjects Research Committee or the NYUAD Research Participation Protection Program. The database will not be shared with people unaffiliated with NYU unless they are on a specific project and their involvement has been approved by NYU."}]}]
