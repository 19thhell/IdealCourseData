Classroom and case discussions helped us translate those perspectives, theories, and concepts into our own work environment.

work with children ages pre-school through latency. In addition to play therapy, the curriculum includes courses in child development, attachment, parenting, diagnosis of disorders of childhood, and child-focused family interventions. This course utilizes a focus on practice with children and families in a range of settings, including treatment strategies for children who have been traumatized, as well as those seen in schools and family service agencies.

The clinical population served by the FSP includes traditional as well as non-traditional families and couples. Through the FSP interns gain didactic and theoretical instruction as well as direct and indirect clinical experience in family and couples therapy. Each intern participates on a team with at least two other supervisees: another intern and, frequently, a child/adolescent psychiatry fellow. Two senior supervisors work with each team in an intensive supervisory model. Each intern will have the opportunity to be the primary therapist or co-therapist on a case, as well as a member of the observing team on their colleagues\u2019 cases. Sessions are conducted in front of a one-way mirror, and the \u2018live\u2019 supervision transpires as the session occurs, providing immediate feedback to the therapist. Such supervision typically consists of telephone call-ins during the session, inter-session conferences with supervisors and colleagues, and occasional co-therapy with a supervisor. As team members, interns actively participate in their colleagues\u2019 cases through pre- and post-session discussion and the \u2018reflecting team\u2019 process.     The theoretical orientation of the family program is systemic at base, but integrative and collaborative as it incorporates new developments in the field and the expanding resources of the Child Study Center. General orientation to family therapy theory and technique is provided to all interns through scheduled seminars early in the year.     The FSP also provides interns with training in PREP\u00ae (Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program). PREP\u00ae is a workshop-based preventive program for all couples, including non-traditional and GLBTQ couples, who are interested in enhancing the quality of their relationship and learning skills to improve communication and problem-solving. Interns who elect to receive this training will have the opportunity to serve as coaches for couples during one of the one-day PREP\u00ae workshops held over the course of the year.
