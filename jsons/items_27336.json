Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .    Intro to Writing the Half Hour Comedy    NCRD-UT 8005 This intensive scriptwriting class answers the question, \"What do I need to break into TV writing?\" The student is be guided through the step-by-step development of an episode for an ongoing TV sitcom, from premise line to one-page outline, to pages and revisions. The course requires the completion of a polished draft while introducing students to the rigors of professional standards through weekly story goals. The course is taught by a professional television writer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .    Additional Courses You May Consider to Complete Your Certificate    Please select two of the following courses to complete your certificate.    Playwriting I    NCRD-UT 30       A playwriting workshop required of all students. Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length stage play with an outline of the complete play. The first third of the course focuses on exercises to help students develop a story idea with the complexity and depth to sustain a full-length play. The reading and analysis of four to six dramatic texts is required in conjunction with the student\u2019s original work. Students must come to the first class with two ideas for a full-length play. Each idea should be described in a one page summary. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule . Screenwriting I NCRD-UT 8003          A screenwriting workshop required of all Dramatic Writing majors and designed for the beginning screenwriter. Students are required to complete 50-70 pages of a full-length screenplay with an outline of the rest. The first third of the course focuses on exercises to help students develop five story ideas with the complexity and depth to sustain a full-length screenplay. One of these ideas will serve as the basis for the required work. The reading and analysis of four to six screenplays is required in conjunction with the student\u2019s original work. Students must come to the first class with three ideas for full-length screenplays. Each idea can be described in one or two paragraphs. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .  Sketch Comedy Writing   NCRD-UT 8012    This is a sketch writing workshop class. A survey of sketch genres and approaches will be integrated with writing assignments and rewriting of one's own sketches: both privately and collaboratively. The goal is for each student to emerge from the class with several polished sketches. For this class, it helps to have a good sense of humor that you want to get even better at putting down on the page. There will be a lot of group critiquing and occasionally group rewriting. So it helps to stop thinking that your first draft is perfect. Because it isn't. This can be a pretty wild class, so it also helps to never think that comedy can go \"too far.\" The course may have a guest lecturer. Non-credit tuition: $2,683 View course schedule .
