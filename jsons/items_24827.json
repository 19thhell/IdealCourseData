phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Nursing Research at NYU Langone Medical Center is based on a philosophy that values and promotes quality patient care via excellence in clinical practice, research, and data-based decision making. As a Magnet hospital we are committed to support and integrate research and evidence-based practice activities into the quality and outcomes management initiatives. Supporting and conducting research is an integral component of the departments of nursing at NYULMC.     Nursing Research Council    Consistent with values that fuel the forces of magnetism, the Nursing Research Council guides nursing staff to use an evidence-based approach to improve patient care through critically appraising and applying research findings, evaluating practice and /or conducting research to improve care to patients.\u00a0 The Nursing Research Council provides a structure for all nurses interested and engaged in the research process to gain exposure and experience through mentoring of such skills as problem identification, computer searches, critical appraisal of the literature, research design and proposal development, the Institutional Review Board approval process, data collection, management, and analysis, presentation of results, submission of abstracts, proposals, and publications. Chaired by the Director of Nursing Research, the Council promotes an interest in research and evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes, via monthly meetings, individual consultation, research forums, written and electronic communications, collaborative projects. The Research Council identifies, evaluates and recommends nursing research projects for study at NYULMC through communication with Nursing Quality &amp; Performance Improvement (Q&amp;PI) and other Nursing Councils.     Research Dissemination    The Research Council also nurtures and supports publication and presentation of research studies and evidence-based practice projects in pertinent forums. NYU Langone Medical Center sponsors an annual Research and Evidence-Based Practice Conference that provides a forum to showcases projects initiated by staff and other investigators including faculty and students from NYU and other local colleges and universities.     The McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program    The Margaret L. McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program awards a fellowship each year to a Visiting Nurse Scholar in support of consultation with nursing staff for the purpose of stimulating clinical inquiry to enhance nursing practice. This individual also serves\u00a0 as the keynote speaker for the annual research conference.     Research Collaboration    The NYU Langone Medical Center has a long history of collaboration and clinical partnerships with the New York University College of Nursing. These efforts help to create a practice environment that promotes clinical scholarship that is mutually beneficial for students, faculty, staff, and patients. Ongoing projects advance the generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge to improve nursing practice and patient outcomes.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Nursing Research at NYU Langone Medical Center is based on a philosophy that values and promotes quality patient care via excellence in clinical practice, research, and data-based decision making. As a Magnet hospital we are committed to support and integrate research and evidence-based practice activities into the quality and outcomes management initiatives. Supporting and conducting research is an integral component of the departments of nursing at NYULMC.     Nursing Research Council    Consistent with values that fuel the forces of magnetism, the Nursing Research Council guides nursing staff to use an evidence-based approach to improve patient care through critically appraising and applying research findings, evaluating practice and /or conducting research to improve care to patients.\u00a0 The Nursing Research Council provides a structure for all nurses interested and engaged in the research process to gain exposure and experience through mentoring of such skills as problem identification, computer searches, critical appraisal of the literature, research design and proposal development, the Institutional Review Board approval process, data collection, management, and analysis, presentation of results, submission of abstracts, proposals, and publications. Chaired by the Director of Nursing Research, the Council promotes an interest in research and evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes, via monthly meetings, individual consultation, research forums, written and electronic communications, collaborative projects. The Research Council identifies, evaluates and recommends nursing research projects for study at NYULMC through communication with Nursing Quality &amp; Performance Improvement (Q&amp;PI) and other Nursing Councils.     Research Dissemination    The Research Council also nurtures and supports publication and presentation of research studies and evidence-based practice projects in pertinent forums. NYU Langone Medical Center sponsors an annual Research and Evidence-Based Practice Conference that provides a forum to showcases projects initiated by staff and other investigators including faculty and students from NYU and other local colleges and universities.     The McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program    The Margaret L. McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program awards a fellowship each year to a Visiting Nurse Scholar in support of consultation with nursing staff for the purpose of stimulating clinical inquiry to enhance nursing practice. This individual also serves\u00a0 as the keynote speaker for the annual research conference.     Research Collaboration    The NYU Langone Medical Center has a long history of collaboration and clinical partnerships with the New York University College of Nursing. These efforts help to create a practice environment that promotes clinical scholarship that is mutually beneficial for students, faculty, staff, and patients. Ongoing projects advance the generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge to improve nursing practice and patient outcomes.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Nursing Research at NYU Langone Medical Center is based on a philosophy that values and promotes quality patient care via excellence in clinical practice, research, and data-based decision making. As a Magnet hospital we are committed to support and integrate research and evidence-based practice activities into the quality and outcomes management initiatives. Supporting and conducting research is an integral component of the departments of nursing at NYULMC.     Nursing Research Council    Consistent with values that fuel the forces of magnetism, the Nursing Research Council guides nursing staff to use an evidence-based approach to improve patient care through critically appraising and applying research findings, evaluating practice and /or conducting research to improve care to patients.\u00a0 The Nursing Research Council provides a structure for all nurses interested and engaged in the research process to gain exposure and experience through mentoring of such skills as problem identification, computer searches, critical appraisal of the literature, research design and proposal development, the Institutional Review Board approval process, data collection, management, and analysis, presentation of results, submission of abstracts, proposals, and publications. Chaired by the Director of Nursing Research, the Council promotes an interest in research and evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes, via monthly meetings, individual consultation, research forums, written and electronic communications, collaborative projects. The Research Council identifies, evaluates and recommends nursing research projects for study at NYULMC through communication with Nursing Quality &amp; Performance Improvement (Q&amp;PI) and other Nursing Councils.     Research Dissemination    The Research Council also nurtures and supports publication and presentation of research studies and evidence-based practice projects in pertinent forums. NYU Langone Medical Center sponsors an annual Research and Evidence-Based Practice Conference that provides a forum to showcases projects initiated by staff and other investigators including faculty and students from NYU and other local colleges and universities.     The McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program    The Margaret L. McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program awards a fellowship each year to a Visiting Nurse Scholar in support of consultation with nursing staff for the purpose of stimulating clinical inquiry to enhance nursing practice. This individual also serves\u00a0 as the keynote speaker for the annual research conference.     Research Collaboration    The NYU Langone Medical Center has a long history of collaboration and clinical partnerships with the New York University College of Nursing. These efforts help to create a practice environment that promotes clinical scholarship that is mutually beneficial for students, faculty, staff, and patients. Ongoing projects advance the generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge to improve nursing practice and patient outcomes.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Nursing Research at NYU Langone Medical Center is based on a philosophy that values and promotes quality patient care via excellence in clinical practice, research, and data-based decision making. As a Magnet hospital we are committed to support and integrate research and evidence-based practice activities into the quality and outcomes management initiatives. Supporting and conducting research is an integral component of the departments of nursing at NYULMC.     Nursing Research Council    Consistent with values that fuel the forces of magnetism, the Nursing Research Council guides nursing staff to use an evidence-based approach to improve patient care through critically appraising and applying research findings, evaluating practice and /or conducting research to improve care to patients.\u00a0 The Nursing Research Council provides a structure for all nurses interested and engaged in the research process to gain exposure and experience through mentoring of such skills as problem identification, computer searches, critical appraisal of the literature, research design and proposal development, the Institutional Review Board approval process, data collection, management, and analysis, presentation of results, submission of abstracts, proposals, and publications. Chaired by the Director of Nursing Research, the Council promotes an interest in research and evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes, via monthly meetings, individual consultation, research forums, written and electronic communications, collaborative projects. The Research Council identifies, evaluates and recommends nursing research projects for study at NYULMC through communication with Nursing Quality &amp; Performance Improvement (Q&amp;PI) and other Nursing Councils.     Research Dissemination    The Research Council also nurtures and supports publication and presentation of research studies and evidence-based practice projects in pertinent forums. NYU Langone Medical Center sponsors an annual Research and Evidence-Based Practice Conference that provides a forum to showcases projects initiated by staff and other investigators including faculty and students from NYU and other local colleges and universities.     The McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program    The Margaret L. McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program awards a fellowship each year to a Visiting Nurse Scholar in support of consultation with nursing staff for the purpose of stimulating clinical inquiry to enhance nursing practice. This individual also serves\u00a0 as the keynote speaker for the annual research conference.     Research Collaboration    The NYU Langone Medical Center has a long history of collaboration and clinical partnerships with the New York University College of Nursing. These efforts help to create a practice environment that promotes clinical scholarship that is mutually beneficial for students, faculty, staff, and patients. Ongoing projects advance the generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge to improve nursing practice and patient outcomes.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

Nursing Research at NYU Langone Medical Center is based on a philosophy that values and promotes quality patient care via excellence in clinical practice, research, and data-based decision making. As a Magnet hospital we are committed to support and integrate research and evidence-based practice activities into the quality and outcomes management initiatives. Supporting and conducting research is an integral component of the departments of nursing at NYULMC.     Nursing Research Council    Consistent with values that fuel the forces of magnetism, the Nursing Research Council guides nursing staff to use an evidence-based approach to improve patient care through critically appraising and applying research findings, evaluating practice and /or conducting research to improve care to patients.\u00a0 The Nursing Research Council provides a structure for all nurses interested and engaged in the research process to gain exposure and experience through mentoring of such skills as problem identification, computer searches, critical appraisal of the literature, research design and proposal development, the Institutional Review Board approval process, data collection, management, and analysis, presentation of results, submission of abstracts, proposals, and publications. Chaired by the Director of Nursing Research, the Council promotes an interest in research and evidence-based nursing practice to improve patient outcomes, via monthly meetings, individual consultation, research forums, written and electronic communications, collaborative projects. The Research Council identifies, evaluates and recommends nursing research projects for study at NYULMC through communication with Nursing Quality &amp; Performance Improvement (Q&amp;PI) and other Nursing Councils.     Research Dissemination    The Research Council also nurtures and supports publication and presentation of research studies and evidence-based practice projects in pertinent forums. NYU Langone Medical Center sponsors an annual Research and Evidence-Based Practice Conference that provides a forum to showcases projects initiated by staff and other investigators including faculty and students from NYU and other local colleges and universities.     The McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program    The Margaret L. McClure Visiting Nurse Scholar Program awards a fellowship each year to a Visiting Nurse Scholar in support of consultation with nursing staff for the purpose of stimulating clinical inquiry to enhance nursing practice. This individual also serves\u00a0 as the keynote speaker for the annual research conference.     Research Collaboration    The NYU Langone Medical Center has a long history of collaboration and clinical partnerships with the New York University College of Nursing. These efforts help to create a practice environment that promotes clinical scholarship that is mutually beneficial for students, faculty, staff, and patients. Ongoing projects advance the generation, dissemination, and application of knowledge to improve nursing practice and patient outcomes.

Whether to answer a clinical question, to gather background information on a topic, to meet a grant deadline or write a research paper, nurses and nursing students need to understand how information is arranged before they can locate, appraise, and apply the knowledge gained.   Information may be found in: books, articles, pre-appraised sources, government documents, dissertations, web sites, unpublished in the \"grey\" literature, and more!

Information in popular periodicals such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal? Often articles in popular periodicals can lead you to references to the scholarly literature.   Information that has been aggregated from many sources (such as a textbook)? (Even recently published book information may be at least 3-5 years old.)   Information in scholarly journal articles? This is the place to find the most recently published research evidence. A PICO(T) question is usually answered by accessing the scholarly journal literature.   Ready reference information: a fact, a definition, a short description, drug side effect, etc.?           Are you interested in the historical, ethical, psychosocial, or policy aspects of the topic? Or are you looking for the clinical/biomedical aspects of the topic?   Decide how much you are looking for:     What is the scope of the project?   Do you want several recent articles on a topic?   Are you writing a paper and looking for both background information from textbooks plus some recent journal information?   Are you writing a dissertation?     What level of evidence do you require? Are you looking for evaluated, \"peer-reviewed,\" scholarly sources? Do you want information appropriate for clinical application? Information in a journal article may not necessarily be ready for clinical application; the critical appraisal must come first.       Click Next to go to Module 1.3.

Examples:     I need an overview of type 2 diabetes (a disease).   I need a summary of best strategies for...     infection control in inpatient settings   weight loss for obese adolescents     I need to review the history of health care reform in the U.S.   I need a definition of hirsutism.   What are the side effects of statin drugs?   I need a summary of recommendations and best practices for postop care following total knee arthroplasty (or another procedure).     Background/overview information may be found in sources such as     books, reference books, textbooks, chapters, appendices (available both in print and electronically)       drug directories, guides to diagnostic tests       overview articles (often tagged as \"review articles\" accessed via article databases; locating articles is detailed in Module 1.5 ; locating review articles is detailed in Module 2.2 )   Expert opinions, pre-synthesized and pre-appraised guidelines, summaries.     Using a library catalog like BobCat (or the catalog for your own institution; see box on the right) can be a good starting point for locating books, reference books, and electronic reference tools.   The Bobcat search below begins with natural language key words hospital infection. Notice the SUBJECT terms on the left that describe the results in the full library record. Notice the subject term: nosocomial infections . So, re-doing your initial search , using the standard terms: nosocomial infections OR cross infection might be more effective.                The full display below shows the first book on the list and its call number location:       Once you have a call number, link to a  floor map  to locate a book in Bobst Library.   _______   *Sackett, D.

Now, let's consider another type of research question: \"Foreground\" or more specific queries. Foreground (PICO T) questions seek evidence to answer a need for clinical information related to a specific problem, (or patient, or population) , and an intervention (or therapy) . Clinical questions also require that the evidence be the most recent and highly specific, which is most often found in the scholarly journal literature. Start with an article database.   What is a database? Databases are electronically searchable collections of citations to journal articles, books, dissertations, and other items, published and unpublished) . Database citations (records) are organized into searchable fields: author, title, source, date, publication type , etc. The attributes of the database records can assist searchers to locate items by using the fields to specify search terms.   Article citations are the basic building blocks of databases. Citations describe the contents of journal articles.   Databases may be interdisciplinary and cover a large scope of topic areas, for example: Proquest Central. PubMed ( MEDLINE) , CINAHLPlus , and PsycINFO are examples of specialized databases for health sciences topics. Databases provide access to citations for:     articles in newspapers, magazines, &amp; journals   chapters in books   essays in collections   government, international, &amp; other documents   dissertations   more (e.g., continuing education programs, selected websites, conference proceedings)      The BOX on the right links to full lists of health sciences databases at your library&gt;&gt;&gt;   Below are examples of database citations from CINAHLPlus and Medline/PubMed:        Anatomy of a database record: a CINAHLPlus citation   CINAHLPlus is the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, with indexing for more than 3,800 journals from the fields of nursing and allied health, with selective indexing back to 1937.  The CINAHLPlus citation below describes an article from the journal Nursing Research . Descriptive information (metadata) is arranged in searchable fields for author, title, etc. The subject headings are standardized terms drawn from a thesaurus. In the example below you can see that the term Postnatal Period is the standardized term assigned to describe the topic \"postpartum.\"           Anatomy of a database record: a Medline/Pubmed Citation   Below is a sample citation from another database: Medline.   What is Medline/PubMed? Medline is the premier biomedical database, with more than 24 million records, produced by the National Library of Medicine. The citation below describes an article from the journal BMJ. Descriptive information (metadata) is arranged in searchable fields for author, title, etc. and the MeSH terms (Medical Subject Heading) field which includes standardized terms drawn from a controlled vocabulary of terms. Notice the term Cross Infection is the standardized term to describe the topic: hospital infection.             Click Next to go to Module 1.6.

For example, CINAHLPlus (the electronic version of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health) is the first place to search for nursing literature. CINAHLPlus provides indexing for more than 3,800 journals from the fields of nursing and allied health, with indexing for selected journals back to 1937.       All searchers of nursing information should always search MEDLINE (PubMed) , the premier biomedical database, because it indexes many of the international nursing journals that are not indexed in CINAHL and contains articles of interest to nurses that are published in biomedical journals.   PsycINFO is a major database covering the scholarly literature in the psychological, social, behavioral, and health sciences, with selected coverage back to the 19th century. When your topic has any psychosocial or behavioral aspect, consider PsycINFO.   Proquest Central is multidisciplinary resource for research on contemporary topics or for the beginning stages of a research project. Offers citations from a wide range of English language academic journals, news magazines, including the New York Times and Wall Street Journal .     The above list is just a sample of health sciences databases.

A simple search on: handwashing retrieves all article citations containing that term.       A search using AND retrieves citations with BOTH terms, e.g.: handwashing AND cross infection .   OR is used to connect synonyms . A search using OR retrieves citations with ANY of search terms present, e.g.: (cross infection OR nosocomial infection OR hospital acquired infection).       Research question with a Problem AND Intervention: Does handwashing among healthcare workers reduce hospital-acquired infection ?    Combine the two terms with AND for a preliminary literature search.

By citing your sources, you are showing your reader how you came to your conclusions and acknowledging the work of others that brought you to your conclusions. Citing your sources:     Documents your research and scholarship   Acknowledges the work of others whose scholarship contributed to your work   Helps your reader understand the context of your argument   Provides information for your reader to use to locate additional information on your topic   Establishes the credibility of your scholarship   Provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your own integrity and understanding of academic ethics   Avoids plagiarism!     Habits to acquire:     Starting with the first draft of a paper, get in the habit of acknowledging where ideas and quotes came from.    Keep a paper trail of your sources. Include information about the source in your note-taking.   Enclose direct quotes with quotation marks and keep track of the original source.  Avoid copying and pasting unless using quotation marks.   As you paraphrase the words and ideas of others, keep track of the original source.    Use a citation building tool: Refworks, Endnote, EasyBib, etc.     Style Guidelines:      Your professor may suggest or require a standard style format for your work (e.g, APA Style).

Only a small percentage of the published literature contains evidence that is ready for clinical application. It is estimated that only 1 in 5000 ideas eventually makes it through all of the trials and the research stages to produce evidence with clinical outcomes ( McKibbon, Wilczynski, Eady, &amp; Marks, 2009).   A literature search for the highest level of evidence -- one that applies more rigorous criteria -- filters for articles that use higher quality methodologies.   Evidence pyramids depict the range of publication types:     Systematic reviews : (Authors of a systematic review ask a specific clinical question, perform a comprehensive literature search, eliminate the poorly done studies and attempt to make practice recommendations based on the well-done studies. A meta-analysis is a systematic review that combines all the results of all the studies into a single statistical analysis of results.)   Critically appraised topics (evidence syntheses)   Critically appraised articles (authors evaluate and synopsize individual research studies)   Randomized controlled trials: \"Experiments in which individuals are randomly allocated to an experimental or control group in order to test the value or efficiency of a treatment or intervention\" (CINAHLPlus Scope Note)   Cohort studies   Ideas, opinions, editorials, an article in a newsletter or non-peer-reviewed publication   Case reports   Background information, or any of a number of other publication types     The most clinically relevant material published is found at the top of an \"evidence pyramid.\" View the NYU evidence pyramid in the box on the right.   Models of EBP describe the evidence-based process in 5 steps:     Develop an answerable question.   Locate the best evidence.   Critically appraise the evidence.   Integrate the evidence into practice using clinical expertise with attention to patient's values and perspectives.   Evaluate outcome(s).

Secondary sources such as:     encyclopedias, textbooks, drug directories   print and online summaries   \"point of care\" summaries (such as Nursing Reference Center, see box on the right &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;)     may help with this type of question. Additionally, an up-to-date research article or a \"review\" article on a broad topic may also summarize the state of the art for a background question.      An overview or background question for an article search might be:   \"Is there recent evidence to support the effective use of therapeutic touch in the elderly?\"      Searching for Content:   First we address the content of the question: therapeutic touch. Using an article database like CINAHLPlus, the key word search therapeutic touch retrieves more than 8400 articles!      Narrowing the Content:   One way to begin to restrict results and increase relevance is to notice the CINAHLPlus Subject headings. They may be seen as descriptors for the most relevant results as you browse. Or you may search the online thesaurus \"CINAHL Headings\" at the top of the search page. The record below depicts revised search results, based on a search for the term Therapeutic Touch as a Subject Heading (not as a key word). The results are now shown with 404 results. When an index term is applied to an article citation, it indicates the term is a topic of the article, rather than just a key word(s) that might appear in the abstract.         Limiting for Article Type:   Once we have located the subject terms for content, we can use LIMITS to find a Review article, secondary source material.   In CINAHLPlus, a Review article is defined as : \"  a review of the published literature that can cover a wide range of subject matter of various levels of completeness or comprehensiveness. The presence of research findings or case reports does not preclude designation as a review.\"      Popular Limits appear in the Refine Your Results (left menu) of the CINAHLPlus screen. For more limits, choose Show More in left menu, then select an option for Publication Type:          Below is a sample search result based on the limit to Publication Type: Review       Below is an example of another CINAHLPlus search limiting by Publication Type, this time the result of limiting to Publication type: Research       In CINAHLPlus, a Research article is defined as :  \"an original (includes SECONDARY ANALYSIS), complete research study containing data collection, methodology, discussion of results, etc.\"      You have seen how to apply LIMITS to answer a background question such as the use of therapeutic touch in the elderly by locating a Review article.   And you have seen a way to raise the level of evidence in a search by limiting to a Research article.   To further limit to an age group, you could use the limit to restrict to Age Group: Aged (65 and over).   The next module will show how to apply LIMITS and raise the level of evidence for a foreground question.

Identifying the PICO (T)* elements helps to focus your question:          P  = problem/patient/population    I = intervention    C =  comparison intervention   O = outcome   (T) = time factor, type of study (optional)      Example question: Does handwashing among healthcare workers reduce hospital acquired infection?                     Example:       P (problem/patient/population)   hospital acquired infection       I (intervention/indicator)   handwashing       C (comparison)   no handwashing; other solution; masks       O (outcome of interest)   reduced infection             To begin a database search your initial strategy should begin with the P and the I only:             Viewing the initial article results, you may decide to narrow your search with terms for the C omparison and O utcome.   (Some models of EBP add in T (PICOT) for time factor or type of study. Other models add C for Context (PICOC) . You can add limits for time , type of study, or other contextual limits, later. Keep the initial search broad.   As you browse results, abstracts, and the full text of articles you will locate the narrower C omparative terms, O utcome measures and type of study elements,  but keep the initial search broad.

Below are ways to expand (broaden) your search:     \"Harvest\" terms to add to search (synonyms)  For example, a search for health care reform bill may retrieve citations described with added terms you can use for an expanded search using OR:   health care reform bill OR health care bill OR \"Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \" OR Affordable Care Act OR PPACA OR Health Care Reform/legislation &amp; jurisprudence [MeSH] OR Obamacare         Use the online thesaurus in CINAHL, PubMed or PsycINFO to locate the standard term for your topic. For example, the standard term for PPACA is: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act    Truncate one or more of your search terms using the database truncation symbol (usually * or ? )      Diab* (retrieves: diabetes, diabetic, diabetogenic)    Autis* (retrieves: autism, autistic)    Nurs* (retrieves: nurse, nurses, nursing, etc.).      Warning! Truncation may also retrieve false hits. A search on nurs* retrieves &ldquo;nursery school.&rdquo; Diab* retrieves \"diabolical.\"         \"Citation pearl growing\" uses a relevant source (like an article) to lead to more sources on a topic.        Look near the citation for a link to \"Related\" articles or &ldquo;Find Similar Results.\" Also known as \"snowballing.\"   From a relevant article, follow up on citations in the bibliography (the \"ancestry\" method)   Use the \"Cited References\" feature if available. More about \"cited reference searching\" is described here .                  Try another database. Often the scope of the database doesn't match your search needs. Review the specialized health sciences databases here .   Pre-evaluated, pre-synthesized sources (including &ldquo;systematic reviews&rdquo;) aggregate the best evidence for a given topic. They may appraise the quality of studies and often make recommendations for practice. Go on to the next module to learn about Critically Appraised sources.

And Step 3, Critically appraise the evidence, ensures that the evidence is evaluated, whether a randomized controlled trial, a systematic review, a practice guideline, or any other type of evidence.   Specialized tools are considered standard for evaluating different publication types. For example :     The PRISMA tool, specialized for evaluating systematic reviews and meta-analyses, located at the PRISMA Statement Web Site   PRISMA stands for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. It is an evidence-based minimum set of items for reporting in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram helps authors improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.      The CASP Critical Appraisal Tools, an international collaboration that supports the teaching and learning of critical appraisal skills, and in particular helps other people set up sustainable training programmes.

As you saw in modules 1 and 2, you might search a specialized biomedical database such as Medline/PubMed, or a database of psychology literature, such as PsycINFO.   No one organization owns, monitors, or controls the Internet. As a result, finding information can be challenging and requires combining search strategies.There are several ways to explore the Web. Sometimes you know the URL (uniform resource locator), much like you'd memorize someone's phone number, and you can locate a site directly.     You may find out about a specialized Web site for geriatric nursing: http://www.hartfordign.org/   or a site that has a directory of nursing blogs: http://www.mastersofnursing.org/50-best-nursing-blogs-you-arent-reading-yet.html     Often a Web site will provide a collection of preselected links in a category, also known as a \"meta site.\" Meta sites are an excellent starting point for beginning searchers. For example:     Essential Nursing Resources : published biennially by the Interagency Council on Information Resources in Nursing (ICIRN), this 36 page list includes print, electronic, and web sources to support nursing practice, education, administration, and research activities.       From a site or meta site one can link to related sites (\"surf\"). But the web is not arranged in a linear way, and this can be a very inefficient way to search for specific information.

The web search engines allow you to search the general contents of the Web in a more haphazard and incomplete way. Although you may find links to selected full-text articles free on the Web, this represents only a small portion of the literature. Comprehensive searchers cannot rely on this small fraction of what is published.   TIP: The first place to begin a literature search is to use the library licensed electronic databases such as CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index. Refer back to Module 1 for a more detailed discussion of these databases.   Scholarly literature, peer-reviewed, is expensive to produce and organize, and most bibliographic databases and full-text electronic journals are only obtained by license arrangements (e.g, NYU and Mount Sinai subscribe to a number of databases) as institutional subscriptions).   Licensed databases (\"fee-based\") are available from your library's databases page. See the box on the right.   Click on the Next button to go to Module 3.4.

Using a search engine is similar to searching the index of a book. The searcher enters a word and the engine retrieves records with key words or phrases matching the term entered. Although valuable for locating obscure information, keyword searching can result in large unwieldy lists and may retrieve terms out-of-context.   For example, a search using the term \"nursing\" may retrieve sites related to nursing as a professional discipline as well as sites that use \"nursing\" in other contexts (lactation, commercial sites selling uniforms, home health care agencies, etc.).   Each search engine has its own rules for determining how sites are collected and arranged and how search results are ranked according to relevance. Some rank based on frequency of occurrence in retrieved documents; others rank based on how frequently a site is linked from other sites. Search engines have different rules for entering a search string, using boolean connectors, use of quotation marks for phrases, truncation symbols, etc. So this means that your search statement can affect results dramatically.   Some search engines also include a subject directory of the included sites. Look for the \"help\" link on the search engine home page to determine how to enter a search.   What about Google Scholar ? You may know that scholar.google.com is a subset of the larger Google database. Generally, scholar.google.com is not helpful for conducting a literature search for articles because it lacks the filtering functionality discussed in module 2. It is a helpful tool for locating a \"known item.\" For example, if you know an author, part of a title, the journal name, or other citation information, try pasting those details into scholar.google.com and see what you retrieve.   Searchers should always consider using several search tools because no one search engine covers the entire contents of the web.   Click on the Next button to go to Module 3.5.

Google Scholar is a time-saving, scholarly search interface accessible from within the Google interface. With Google Scholar, you can access peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book sections. For literature searching, specialized databases have more functionality and access more comprehensive results, but Google Scholar is a good tool to use for a search for a known item .   You can configure Google Scholar to:     Display a link to NYU options for the full-text of an article   Export your citations to RefWorks or EndNote     Here's how to display NYU links:     Open scholar.google.com   Go to the Settings icon (upper right screen)   Click on left menu item, \"Library Links\"   Type in: NYU   From the results, put a check mark next to \"New York University Libraries-GetIt at NYU\"   Click on Save to save preferences.

Searching a web directory is similar to browsing the table of contents of a book. One tries to decide how someone else might have classified information by browsing categories.   Yahoo.com , like many specialized databases , organizes information in hierarchical categories. It is possible to locate Web sites in Yahoo by browsing (or \"drilling down\") through the hierarchies.   Links   Yahoo.com ..Yahoo/Health ...Yahoo/Health/Nursing ......Yahoo/Health/Nursing/History ......... Yahoo/Health/Nursing/History/Florence Nightingale   In the example shown above, browsing hierarchical menus in Yahoo could lead you to a list of Florence Nightingale links, including this one to a free version of Miss Nightingale's New York Times obituary on August 15, 1910: http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0512.html   Click on the Next button to go to Module 3.6.

Contents of specialized databases, whether free or fee-based, are not always located using search tools such as directories or search engines. The valuable information within these databases has been called the invisible web . Database contents are searchable only by entering the individual database or repository. Examples of some of the largest invisible or \"deep\" web sites not fully accessible by general search engines are     PubMed.gov   Amazon.com   ebay.com     Based on your use of the above sites you recognize that best and most comprehensive searching and retrieval is done from the site itself, using the full functionality of the native interface to access contents.

Nurses are \"physically present in more settings than any other health care worker\" and need to respond to more informed consumers (National League for Nursing, 1998). The proliferation of information available on the web, and healthcare consumers' need for quality information written for a lay audience, makes it critical that nurses direct consumers to quality information. Below are some suggested sites:     Medlineplus , for both consumers and health professionals, brings together authoritative information from NLM, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and other government agencies and health-related organizations.   The Medical Library Association's Top Ten Recommended Web Sites, a meta site for consumers.

The web contains documents in many nonstandard formats, contributed by non-screened sources, and unevaluated for quality (unlike the scholarly, peer reviewed literature, which is organized into journals and cited in standard records by the bibliographic databases).   As the World Wide Web evolves, steps are being taken to ensure consistency and establish standards. The Health on the Net (HON) Foundation, a not-for-profit, international collaboration, has published a Code of Conduct that suggests standards for producers of health information web sites.   There are basic, agreed-upon criteria for evaluating web sites. As health professionals interactive with patients, nurses need to be alert to the context in which information is presented. Patients reading information intended for professionals may misinterpret information. While the date a Web site was last modified may be recent, this does not ensure that the information is up-to-date. Nurses should approach all information critically.
