Please see below for information on how and when to take them.  Jump to: Foreign Language Placement and Exemption Examinations      Calculus (and Mathematics for Economics) Placement Information and Examinations    The Department of Mathematics has important information here on the prerequisites and criteria for entering Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and placing into higher levels of calculus, as well as information on how Advanced Placement and other examinations may affect placement. For a schedule of upcoming calculus placement exams, click here . Note: Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) carries the exact same prerequisites and criteria for entry as Calculus I. WINTER 2015     Incoming transfers may take an on-campus calculus placement exam on Thursday, January 22 at 2:00pm in Warren Weaver Hall, Room 101. Pre-registration is required. Click here . If students show up at the exam who haven't pre-registered using this specific online form, they will NOT be allowed to take the test. Advanced General Chemistry Placement Information Students planning a major in chemistry or biochemistry (and others with a a strong interest and background in the physical sciences and mathematics) are invited, if eligible, to register for Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) instead of General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125). There is no longer a departmental placement examination. Eligibility is based on presenting three Advanced Placement (or equivalent, such as IB) scores, as follows: Prerequisites: AP Chemistry 5 or equivalent; AP Physics 4 or equivalent; AP Calculus AB 4 or equivalent; and permission of the department. Corequisite: Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Honors Calculus II (MATH-UA 222). SUMMER 2014 Eligible incoming freshmen must (after discussing with their CAS academic adviser) contact the Department of Chemistry as soon as possible with their full name, NYU N#, and a request to be enrolled in Advanced General Chemistry for fall 2014. Requests received after August 1st will be considered if space permits. For contact information, consult the department's website here . Computer Science Placement Information and Examinations Students with little or no programming knowledge who are considering a major or minor in computer science should begin with Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2). Students with a 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science exam are expected to skip Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) and enroll in Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102). Students considering the major or minor who have no AP credit or previous coursework but have gained a good knowledge of programming on their own are strongly advised to take a placement examination in the Department of Computer Science for possible waiver from CSCI-UA 2 and admission to CSCI-UA 101. All students interested in taking Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) must take Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2) or pass the Placement Exam. Information about our Placement Exam can be found at: http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/placement Sample Placement Exam Questions: http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/freshmen.html The next exam will be held on Thursday, January 22 at 2:00pm in Warren Weaver Hall, Room 312.

Please see below for information on how and when to take them.  Jump to: Foreign Language Placement and Exemption Examinations      Calculus (and Mathematics for Economics) Placement Information and Examinations    The Department of Mathematics has important information here on the prerequisites and criteria for entering Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and placing into higher levels of calculus, as well as information on how Advanced Placement and other examinations may affect placement. For a schedule of upcoming calculus placement exams, click here . Note: Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) carries the exact same prerequisites and criteria for entry as Calculus I. WINTER 2015     Incoming transfers may take an on-campus calculus placement exam on Thursday, January 22 at 2:00pm in Warren Weaver Hall, Room 101. Pre-registration is required. Click here . If students show up at the exam who haven't pre-registered using this specific online form, they will NOT be allowed to take the test. Advanced General Chemistry Placement Information Students planning a major in chemistry or biochemistry (and others with a a strong interest and background in the physical sciences and mathematics) are invited, if eligible, to register for Advanced General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 127) instead of General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125). There is no longer a departmental placement examination. Eligibility is based on presenting three Advanced Placement (or equivalent, such as IB) scores, as follows: Prerequisites: AP Chemistry 5 or equivalent; AP Physics 4 or equivalent; AP Calculus AB 4 or equivalent; and permission of the department. Corequisite: Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Honors Calculus II (MATH-UA 222). SUMMER 2014 Eligible incoming freshmen must (after discussing with their CAS academic adviser) contact the Department of Chemistry as soon as possible with their full name, NYU N#, and a request to be enrolled in Advanced General Chemistry for fall 2014. Requests received after August 1st will be considered if space permits. For contact information, consult the department's website here . Computer Science Placement Information and Examinations Students with little or no programming knowledge who are considering a major or minor in computer science should begin with Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2). Students with a 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science exam are expected to skip Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) and enroll in Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102). Students considering the major or minor who have no AP credit or previous coursework but have gained a good knowledge of programming on their own are strongly advised to take a placement examination in the Department of Computer Science for possible waiver from CSCI-UA 2 and admission to CSCI-UA 101. All students interested in taking Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) must take Introduction to Computer Programming (CSCI-UA 2) or pass the Placement Exam.

NYU Online Placement Exam Students who do not have an SAT II, an AP or an IB placement exam, can now take NYU\u2019s own Online Placement Exam (see link below) before they can register into a language class. The same is true if they have taken university level Spanish not from an NYU-site. Please note that this exam may not be used to fulfill the CORE requirement; it is only used for placement purposes. The NYU Online Placement Exam in Spanish consists of a series of multiple-choice format questions on vocabulary, grammar and reading comprehension. You will have up to 45 minutes to take it and can only take this test once, so you must be ready to show your true current level when you take it. At the exam welcome screen students must provide their first name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students have to print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes. Students who score above the cutoff can take a written in-person exam for exemption from the CORE requirement. They must sign up in advance for the exemption exam. Information on dates and signing up can be found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams (sections IV and V). If they wish to continue their study of the language at NYU they must also take the exemption test to double-check their appropriate placement. Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of academic fraud.
