In studying interaction and conflict in specific locations, he became increasingly interested in the shifting nature of colonial thinking and practices that went into these processes. This new direction led to a book on the relationship of social change and conflict to decolonization in French and British Africa as well as a comparative project begun in the late 1980s with anthropologist Ann Stoler. Cooper and Stoler organized an international conference on colonialism in 1989 and published an edited book, Tensions of Empire, in 1997. Cooper's interest in social theory led him to write a series of articles critical of some of the key concepts widely used in the social sciences and humanities\u2013identity, modernity, and globalization. These and other essays have been collected in his book Colonialism in Question; he also edited with Randall Packard a book on development and the social sciences. Meanwhile, another track was developing, this one coming out of teaching at the University of Michigan (1982-2001) and since then at NYU. Having for many years taught courses not only on Africa, but on social theory, colonialism, and other broad topics, he began to collaborate with Jane Burbank on a graduate course that sought to counter both the national and the modern bias of most historical studies, via a study of the most durable form of political organization in world history\u2013empires. After bringing this course to NYU, Cooper and Burbank put together a lecture course on empires for beginning undergraduates through the MAP program. Teaching this course in turn encouraged Cooper and Burbank to write a book on empires in world history, published in 2010. It won the World History Association prize for 2011 and is being translated into five languages. Cooper has continued to do extensive archival research, the fruits of which are going into the book he is currently completing on citizenship in France and French Africa, 1945-1960. He has been a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1990-91, 1995-96, 2002-03), the Wilson Center (1987), the Rockefeller Study Center in Bellagio (2006), the Institut d'Etudes Avanc\u00e9es de Nantes (2009), and the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin (2010-11). He has also been a visiting professor at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, and Universit\u00e9 de Paris VII. His work has been supported by National Endowment for the Humanities, Guggenheim, ACLS, and other fellowships. His book From Slaves to Squatters won the Herskovits Prize of the African Studies Association. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. In 2011 he presented the  annual Marc Bloch lecture at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and the Thomas Hodgkin Memorial Lecture at Oxford University. In 2012 he delivered the McMillan-Stewart lectures at Harvard University.

This course will survey and critically explore an historical range of black films in relation to the modern city, as an inspiration, as a setting, and as a site of production. We will screen, discuss, read and write about a range of important black independently made, and/or black cast and narrative feature films, such as Juke Joint , Moon Over Harlem , Killer of Sheep , Bush Mama , Stormy Weather , Soul Food, Do the Right Thing .        THE SWEAT OF THY FACE: AFRICAN AMER LABOR HIST - G11.2611     Wednesday 2-4:45   4 pts  Robert Hinton     Enslaved Africans and recently emancipated African Americans, in the United States, are usually depicted working in the fields growing cotton. Folks did grow cotton but that was just one of many roles they played. This seminar looks at the variety of labor experiences of African Americans, in slavery and in freedom. Although designed for graduate students, the seminar is opened to seniors with GPA of 3.75.

Ethnic and cultural heterogeneity was further intensified by prolonged periods of colonization making Caribbean societies some of the oldest colonies in the West which because of their unusual hybrid genesis, could neither be seen as \u201cwestern\u201d or could they be considered \u201cnative\u201d, that is distinctly \u201cother\u201d. This course looks at the Caribbean archipelago in terms of its fragmented island spaces, the dominance of the sea and the influence of the Atlantic world. Theorizing Caribbean identity will be treated not in terms of an inherent wholeness or cultural unity in the region but of open-ended cultural interaction. Caribbean literary theories manifest a connectedness and cross-cultural relocation that mark all the major literary movements. Some of the central paradigms to be addressed will be nationalism, cosmopolitanism, creolization and relationality         THE BLACK BODY AND THE LENS \u2013 G11.3213     Tuesday 2-4:45 Deb Willis     This interdisciplinary seminar explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Central to our discussions will be a focus on how the display of the black body affects society; how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case studies, we will consider the construction of beauty, gendered images, sports, race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary society. The interplay between icon and iconoclastic images, the historical and the contemporary, between self-presentation and imposed representation--all fundamental to our discussions. The seminar will center the student within the contemporaneous world of image making with an emphasis on the black body.
