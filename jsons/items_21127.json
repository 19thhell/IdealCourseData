The seminar portion of the Clinic will introduce students to a range of the different legal, political, and regulatory theories informing the legal norms, practice, and policy of international organizations. It is designed to help students understand the relevance of inter-disciplinary perspectives to the practice of law in global settings, and to learn the ways in which core cognitive lawyering skills (i.e. mastering legal research tools, developing an ability to integrate factual and legal knowledge, strengthening analytical and reasoning skills, and exercising judgment based on the understanding gained) matter in the practice of international law.   \"Thinking like a lawyer\u201d may be more demanding today than it has been in the past, given how complex law and lawyering has become, but it is particularly demanding for lawyers who want to work in an international context. Given the increasing interdependence of legal and economic regimes across countries, lawyers (including domestic lawyers) need a broad set of tools to solve increasingly complex, and sometimes novel, legal problems. There is increasing demand for lawyers with a sound understanding of the institutional, socio-political and economic contexts within which domestic and international legal issues arise and are addressed: how do markets function? How do bureaucracies behave? How do technologies shape change? How do domestic laws interact with international regimes? How do international legal and regulatory regimes and institutions interact with each other?   Course Description   Seminar   Drawing on existing scholarship and ongoing research conducted by faculty and others at NYU School of Law, the seminar will focus on themes that intersect with projects in the areas of global governance, such as inter-institutional cooperation; the role of lawyers and private actors in the creation, the evolution, and interpretation of international legal norms; the relationship between branches/offices of international organizations; the diffusion of ideas and legal norms; the North-South relationship in international law, amongst others.   Students will be encouraged to think about the implications of their clinical project for the people affected by it or by broader actions or policies that relate to the project, and to consider the perspectives of under-represented or non-represented constituencies. They will also be asked to consider the role of an international lawyer in the development of international law, to discuss the professional legal responsibility of lawyers working with international or foreign laws, and to examine the ethics of international law. To this end, the seminar might also feature the occasional participation of members of the UN community and lawyers working in the international organizations.   Fieldwork   The students will work with the clinic professors on projects with international organizations on a broad range of topics related to global governance. In the Fall 2015, the projects will likely entail advisory work for an international development bank. In prior years, students worked with a UN agency on promoting a global accountability mechanism for the post-2015 sustainable development process, advised a major development bank on the need to adapt its accountability institution/complaints mechanism to the changing international development environment, and assisted an international organization to think about ways to promote and regulate the global sharing of information related to viruses with pandemic potential. Although the fieldwork is not an internship , students will have the opportunity to engage first-hand in the work of international organizations. If the organization is geographically proximate, students will have regular visits to the IO\u2019s offices; if the location of the IO makes frequent visits not possible, students will communicate with the IO officials by phone or Skype and will visit the organization at least once.   The combination of fieldwork and seminar will enable students to see the relevance of the theory learned to practice.
