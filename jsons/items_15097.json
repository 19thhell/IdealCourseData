It contains images of 50 toys belonging to 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. The objects were imaged by two cameras under 6 lighting conditions, 9 elevations (30 to 70 degrees every 5 degrees), and 18 azimuths (0 to 340  every 20 degrees).   The training set is composed of 5 instances of each category (instances 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9), and the test set of the remaining 5 instances (instances 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5).

LeCun, F.J. Huang, L. Bottou, Learning Methods for Generic Object Recognition with  Invariance to Pose and Lighting. CVPR 2004. online version    CONTENT    The files are gzipped for download purpose. After uncompressed, they are in a simple  binary matrix format, with file postfix \".mat\". The file format is explained in a  later section.   The \"-dat\" files store the image sequences. The \"-cat\" files store the corresponding  category of the images. Each \"-dat\" file stores 29,160 image pairs (6 categories, 5 instances, 6 lightings, 9 elevations, and 18 azimuths). The 6-th category is for  images without objects, which can be used to train a system to reject images as none  of the 5 object categories. Each corresponding \"-cat\" file contains 29,160 category  labels (0 for animal, 1 for human, 2 for plane, 3 for truck, 4 for car, 5 for blank).   Each \"-info\" file stores 29,160 10-dimensional vectors, which contain additional  information about the corresponding images. The first 4 elements in the vector are:   - 1. the instance in the category (0 to 9)   - 2. the elevation (0 to 8, which mean cameras are 30, 35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70    degrees from the horizontal respectively)   - 3. the azimuth (0,2,4,...,34, multiply by 10 to get the azimuth in degrees)   - 4. the lighting condition (0 to 5)  and the next 6 elements describe the peturbations added to the object when superposed  onto a cluttered background. (see next section)   For regular training and testing, \"-dat\" and \"-cat\" files are sufficient. \"-info\"  files are provided in case some other forms of classification or preprocessing are  needed.     JITTERED OBJECTS AND CLUTTERED BACKGROUND    After capturing, each image has been processed so that the object is centered in  the image (the center of mass of object pixels are in the center of the image),  scaled so that the bounding box is roughly 80x80 pixels, and placed on a uniform  background, including the cast shadow.   And then 3 sources of variations are added to the data set:  - the objects are peturbed  - the objects are superposed onto complex background  - distractor objects are added to the background   The objects are randomly peturbed in 5 ways. They are scaled by factors  between 0.78 to 1.0; in-plane rotated -5 to +5 degrees; and shifted -6 to  +6 pixels horizontally and vertically. The image intensities (in the range  of 0 to 255) are a random value between -20 to +20; image contrasts are  scaled in the range of 0.8 to 1.3. The peturbations are stored in the last 6  elements in the \"-info\" files:   - 5. horizontal shift (-6 to +6)   - 6. vertical shift (-6 to +6)   - 7. lumination change (-20 to +20)   - 8. contrast (0.8 to 1.3)   - 9. object scale (0.78 to 1.0)   - 10. rotation (-5 to +5 degrees)    The complex background images are extracted from a subset of natural scene  images from Corel image library. The images contain scenes with large region  contrasts such as lake against moutain, and irregular region boundaries.   One distractor object is added to each image. The distractor is located toward  the boundary of the image, but can clutter the main object in the center.   There are images with only background and distractor objects. These images belong  to their own category, as indicated in the category files.     FILE FORMAT    The files are stored in the so-called \"binary matrix\" file format, which  is a simple format for vectors and multidimensional matrices of various  element types. Binary matrix files begin with a file header which describes the type and size of the matrix, and then comes the binary image of the matrix.   The header is best described by a C structure:   struct header {   int magic;  // 4 bytes   int ndim;  // 4 bytes, little endian   int dim[3];  };    Note that when the matrix has less than 3 dimensions, say, it's a 1D vector,  then dim[1] and dim[2] are both 1. When the matrix has more than 3 dimensions,  the header will be followed by further dimension size information. Otherwise,  after the file header comes the matrix data, which is stored with the index  in the last dimension changes the fastest.   The magic number encodes the element type of the matrix:   - 0x1E3D4C51 for a single precision matrix   - 0x1E3D4C52 for a packed matrix   - 0x1E3D4C53 for a double precision matrix   - 0x1E3D4C54 for an integer matrix   - 0x1E3D4C55 for a byte matrix   - 0x1E3D4C56 for a short matrix    Since the files are generated on an Intel machine, they use the little-endian  scheme to encode the 4-byte integers. Pay attention when you read the files on  machines that use big-endian.   - The \"-dat\" files store a 4D tensor of dimensions 29160x2x108x108.  - The \"-cat\" files store a 1D vector of dimension 29,160.  - The \"-info\" files store a 2D matrix of dimensions 29160x10.    Here's a piece of Matlab code to show how to read some example files. (to avoid the endian confusion, we read bytes of the header):    >> fid=fopen('norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-dat.mat','r');   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [85 76 61 30], it's a byte matrix   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [4 0 0 0], ndim = 4   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [232 113 0 0], dim0 = 29160 (=113*256+232)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [2 0 0 0],  dim1 = 2   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [108 0 0 0], dim2 = 108   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [108 0 0 0], dim3 = 108   >> imshow(transpose(reshape(fread(fid,108*108),108,108)),[0 255]); % show the first image     >> fid=fopen('norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-cat.mat','r');   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [84 76 61 30], integer matrix   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] ndim = 1   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [232 113 0 0] dim0 = 29160 (=113*256+232)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] (ignore this)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] (ignore this)   >> fread(fid,10,'int'); % [0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3] (on little-endian CPU)     >> fid=fopen('norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-info.mat','r');   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [84 76 61 30], integer matrix   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [2 0 0 0] ndim = 2   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [232 113 0 0] dim0 = 29160 (=113*256+232)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [10 0 0 0] dim1 = 10   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] (ignore this)   >> fread(fid,10,'int'); % [8 5 10 4 -3 0 -6 1 0 -4] (on little-endian CPU)     Here is a screen shot of first 30 image pairs read from \"norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-dat.mat\",  arranged topdown and left-to-right (column major).

When you are writing a paper or doing research on a topic, you must cite your sources. Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list. There are many reasons why citing your sources is important, and you must cite them in order to avoid plagiarism . There are various styles for citing sources; you will most likely find that you will need to use one style if you are writing a paper for a literature course and a different style if you are working in the sciences or social sciences.   How to use this guide :   Using the tabs near the top of this page, you should select the citation style appropriate for your field of study. In each tab, there are some basic examples of items you might be citing. For further examples or more detailed assistance, you may need to refer to a complete writing and style guide. Go to the More Style and Writing Guides tab for more information.   Citation management systems, like RefWorks or Endnote, are extremely useful for keeping track of, organizing, formatting, and sharing your reference lists. Go to the Formatting Tools tab for more information.   If you have questions about how to cite your sources or what style you should use, remember that you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, advisor, or a librarian. Good luck!   What Is Plagiarism?   Why Should You Cite Your Sources?   When Should You Cite Your Sources?           Comments (0)                                         What Is Plagiarism?                  Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.            Comments (0)                                         Why Should You Cite Your Sources?                 All scholarly or academic work requires  that you cite your sources, whether you are writing a long paper or a quick report. Why is citing your research so important?   Researching and writing a paper ideally involves a process of exploring and learning. By citing your sources, you are showing your reader how you came to your conclusions and acknowledging the other people's work that brought you to your conclusions. Citing your sources      Documents your research and   scholarship    Acknowledges the work of others   whose scholarship contributed to your work    Helps your reader understand   the context of your argument    Provides information for your   reader to use to locate additional information on your topic    Establishes the credibility of   your scholarship   Provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your own integrity and understanding of academic ethics        Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Sometimes your professor or your discipline will have specific requirements about when and how to cite your sources. However, these are some guidelines that generally apply.    Always cite your sources when:       You quote verbatim from someone else's work.    You summarize or paraphrase someone else's work.    You are conveying information which may be unfamiliar to your reader (e.g. statistics or factual data).    You are not sure whether or not you need to cite. As mentioned above, when in doubt, err on the side of caution. It is better to give your reader more information rather than less .       Remember, if you have a question about whether or not you need to cite your source, you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help. Sometimes citing your sources takes a little bit of time and effort, but it is worth it to avoid plagiarism.    Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Choosing between the two often depends on subject matter and   nature of sources cited, as each system is favored by different groups   of scholars. If you are unsure what system you should use for your paper, please ask your professor, teaching assistant, or publisher which you should follow.   The humanities style is preferred by many in literature, history, and   the arts. This style presents bibliographic information in notes and,   often, a bibliography. It accommodates a variety of sources, including   esoteric ones less appropriate to the author-date system.   The more concise author-date system has long been used by those in the   physical, natural, and social sciences. In this system, sources are briefly   cited in the text, usually in parentheses, by author&rsquo;s last name   and date of publication. The short citations are amplified in a list   of references, where full bibliographic information is provided.   You must choose to use either the notes and bibliography system ([N] and [B] below) or the author-date system ([T] and [R] below). Do not mix the two systems. Again, ask your professor if you are unsure which is preferred.

Is the author or publisher associated with a special-interest group, such as Greenpeace or the National Rifle Association, that might present only one side of an issue?   Are alternative views presented and addressed? How fairly does the author treat opposing views?   Does the author&rsquo;s language show signs of bias?     Assessing an argument       What is the author&rsquo;s central claim or thesis?   How does the author support this claim&mdash;with relevant and sufficient evidence or with just a few anecdotes or emotional examples?   Are statistics consistent with those you encounter in other sources? Have they been used fairly? Does the author explain where the statistics come from? (It is possible to &ldquo;lie&rdquo; with statistics by using them selectively or by omitting mathematical details.)   Are any of the author&rsquo;s assumptions questionable?   Does the author consider opposing arguments and refute them persuasively?   Does the author fall prey to any logical fallacies?      Evaluating Web sources   Authorship       Does the Web site or document have an author? You may need to do some clicking and scrolling to find the author&rsquo;s name. If you have landed directly on an internal page of a site, for example, you may need to navigate to the home page or find an &ldquo;about this site&rdquo; link to learn the name of the author.   If there is an author, can you tell whether he or she is knowledgeable and credible? When the author&rsquo;s qualifications aren&rsquo;t listed on the site itself, look for links to the author&rsquo;s home page, which may provide evidence of his or her interests and expertise.     Sponsorship       Who, if anyone, sponsors the site? The sponsor of a site is often named and described on the home page.   What does the URL tell you? The domain name extension often indicates the type of group hosting the site: commercial (.com), educational (.edu), nonprofit (.org), governmental (.gov), military (.mil), or network (.net). URLs may also indicate a country of origin: .uk (United Kingdom) or .jp (Japan), for instance.     Purpose and audience       Why was the site created: To argue a position? To sell a product? To inform readers?   Who is the site&rsquo;s intended audience?     Currency       How current is the site? Check for the date of publication or the latest update, often located at the bottom of the home page or at the beginning or end of an internal page.   How current are the site&rsquo;s links? If many of the links no longer work, the site may be too dated for your purposes.       Hacker, Diana and Barbara Fister. Research and Documentation . Bedford / St. Martin's, 2011.

I. A COMMUNITY OF THE MIND   The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any community, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him/her of an education. Most importantly, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. Thus, when students enter the College, one of the first things that they are asked to do is to sign a community compact, recognizing these principles of academic integrity. For this reason also, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness.   \" Nothing is more basic to living and working together than trust. Without it, as Thomas Hobbes warned, humanity is reduced to a &lsquo;war of all against all.' Trust is the condition of cooperation and of social relationships themselves. We learn as children not to be naively trusting, but instead to watch to see which people and which organizations deserve to be trusted. We are disappointed all too often. Law courts and religions try to make people more trustworthy. But being the sort of person who can be trusted is still a personal achievement. Trust does not depend on people putting aside their personal benefits, but on people pursuing them in ways that make them dependable partners to others. Thus lovers try to be faithful and friends loyal. Even in competition, trustworthiness is important. Not only are there punishments for those who cheat, but today's competitor may readily become tomorrow's colleague. An institution like a college depends enormously on trust. Students rightly expect professors to teach honestly and not deceive them. Society trusts scientists not to lie about the results of their research. Neither the pursuit of new knowledge nor the effort to preserve and pass on old wisdom can flourish unless we can trust each other to be intellectually honest. \" &mdash;Craig Calhoun, University Professor of the Social Sciences   II. SOME GUIDELINES   Academic honesty means that the work you submit - in whatever form - is original. Students are expected - often required - to build their work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped you is expected; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft. Obviously, bringing answers into an examination or copying all or part of a paper straight from a book, the Internet, or a fellow student is a violation of this principle. But there are other forms of cheating or plagiarizing which are just as serious, for example:     presenting an oral report drawn without attribution from other sources (oral or written);   writing a paragraph which, despite being in different words, expresses someone else's idea without a reference to the source of the idea;   submitting essentially the same paper in two different courses (unless both instructors have given their permission in advance);   giving or receiving help on a take-home examination or quiz unless expressly permitted by the instructor (as in collaborative projects)   presenting as your own a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;   presenting as your own facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;   submitting another student's work with your name on it;   purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill;   \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.     Term paper mills (web sites and businesses set up to sell papers to students) often claim they are merely offering \"information\" or \"research\" to students and that this service is acceptable and allowed throughout the university. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. If you buy and submit \"research,\" drafts, summaries, abstracts, or final versions of a paper, you are committing plagiarism and are subject to stringent disciplinary action. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact and not intention, it is crucial that you acknowledge every source accurately and completely. If you quote anything from a source, use quotation marks and take down the page number of the quotation to use in your footnote.   When in doubt about whether your acknowledgment is proper and adequate, consult your instructor. Show the instructor your sources and a draft of the paper in which you are using them. The obligation to demonstrate that work is your own rests with you, the student. You are responsible for providing sources, copies of your work, or verification of the date work was completed. While all this looks like a lot to remember, all you need to do is to give credit where it is due, take credit only for your original ideas, and ask your instructor or adviser when in doubt.   Consult the APA, MLA, or Chicago style guides for accepted forms of documentation. You can access these resources, as well as additional information on proper citations on the NYU Libraries Citation Style Guide .   III. PROCEDURES AND SANCTIONS   The penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. The following are the procedures as approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science. See also the College Bulletin .     If a student cheats on an examination or in laboratory work or engages in plagia-rism, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken. The Department can take the following actions: a) The faculty member, with the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Director), may reduce the student's grade or give the student an F in the course.  b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the department believes a more severe penalty (i.e., probation, suspension, expulsion) is warranted, it can refer the case to the Dean or his/her representative (Associate Dean for Students) for further action.   In all cases of either (a) or (b), the Director shall inform the Department Chair of any action in writing and send copies of this letter to the Dean and to the student. The letter shall include the nature of the offense, the penalty, and the right of the student to appeal such penalty. A copy of the letter shall be kept in a confidential chairman's file and not in the student's departmental file. The Dean's office copy shall also be kept in a confidential file. (The Professor and/or the Director is encouraged to meet with the student and discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken.)   For cases involving a first offense at New York University, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semester suspension, or a more severe penalty. (The student is also called in to discuss the offense, and review the consequences of the disciplinary action.)   For cases involving a second offense, the Dean shall proceed as follows:  a) Upon receiving a second Director's letter concerning a given student, the Dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from the department involved, to examine the evidence. This ad hoc committee shall consider if there are reasonable grounds to believe that cheating/plagiarism has occurred and if so, shall affirm the suspension penalty. It shall report its conclusion to the Dean within three business days.  b) If the committee affirms the suspension, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail the suspension letter within two business days of receiving the report. The letter shall advise the student of his or her right to appeal. The student shall have two business days from the letter's delivery to request an appeal of the suspension as provided in Section 5 (below).

{"detail": [{"content": "NORB Object Recognition Dataset, Fu Jie Huang, Yann LeCun, New York University        THE NORB DATASET, V1.0       the small set (with normalized object sizes and uniform background)      Fu Jie Huang , Yann LeCun  Courant Institute, New York University  July 2004      last updated: October,2005   This database is intended for experiments in 3D object reocgnition from shape. It contains images of 50 toys belonging to 5 generic categories: four-legged animals, human figures, airplanes, trucks, and cars. The objects were imaged by two cameras under 6 lighting conditions, 9 elevations (30 to 70 degrees every 5 degrees), and 18 azimuths (0 to 340  every 20 degrees).   The training set is composed of 5 instances of each category (instances 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9), and the test set of the remaining 5 instances (instances 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5).     TERMS / COPYRIGHT    This database is provided for research purposes. It cannot be sold. Publications that include results obtained with this database should reference the following paper:    Y. LeCun, F.J. Huang, L. Bottou, Learning Methods for Generic Object Recognition with  Invariance to Pose and Lighting. CVPR 2004. online version    CONTENT    The files are gzipped for download purpose. After uncompressed, they are in a simple  binary matrix format, with file postfix \".mat\". The file format is explained in a  later section.   The \"-dat\" files store the image sequences. The \"-cat\" files store the corresponding  category of the images. Each \"-dat\" file stores 29,160 image pairs (6 categories, 5 instances, 6 lightings, 9 elevations, and 18 azimuths). The 6-th category is for  images without objects, which can be used to train a system to reject images as none  of the 5 object categories. Each corresponding \"-cat\" file contains 29,160 category  labels (0 for animal, 1 for human, 2 for plane, 3 for truck, 4 for car, 5 for blank).   Each \"-info\" file stores 29,160 10-dimensional vectors, which contain additional  information about the corresponding images. The first 4 elements in the vector are:   - 1. the instance in the category (0 to 9)   - 2. the elevation (0 to 8, which mean cameras are 30, 35,40,45,50,55,60,65,70    degrees from the horizontal respectively)   - 3. the azimuth (0,2,4,...,34, multiply by 10 to get the azimuth in degrees)   - 4. the lighting condition (0 to 5)  and the next 6 elements describe the peturbations added to the object when superposed  onto a cluttered background. (see next section)   For regular training and testing, \"-dat\" and \"-cat\" files are sufficient. \"-info\"  files are provided in case some other forms of classification or preprocessing are  needed.     JITTERED OBJECTS AND CLUTTERED BACKGROUND    After capturing, each image has been processed so that the object is centered in  the image (the center of mass of object pixels are in the center of the image),  scaled so that the bounding box is roughly 80x80 pixels, and placed on a uniform  background, including the cast shadow.   And then 3 sources of variations are added to the data set:  - the objects are peturbed  - the objects are superposed onto complex background  - distractor objects are added to the background   The objects are randomly peturbed in 5 ways. They are scaled by factors  between 0.78 to 1.0; in-plane rotated -5 to +5 degrees; and shifted -6 to  +6 pixels horizontally and vertically. The image intensities (in the range  of 0 to 255) are a random value between -20 to +20; image contrasts are  scaled in the range of 0.8 to 1.3. The peturbations are stored in the last 6  elements in the \"-info\" files:   - 5. horizontal shift (-6 to +6)   - 6. vertical shift (-6 to +6)   - 7. lumination change (-20 to +20)   - 8. contrast (0.8 to 1.3)   - 9. object scale (0.78 to 1.0)   - 10. rotation (-5 to +5 degrees)    The complex background images are extracted from a subset of natural scene  images from Corel image library. The images contain scenes with large region  contrasts such as lake against moutain, and irregular region boundaries.   One distractor object is added to each image. The distractor is located toward  the boundary of the image, but can clutter the main object in the center.   There are images with only background and distractor objects. These images belong  to their own category, as indicated in the category files.     FILE FORMAT    The files are stored in the so-called \"binary matrix\" file format, which  is a simple format for vectors and multidimensional matrices of various  element types. Binary matrix files begin with a file header which describes the type and size of the matrix, and then comes the binary image of the matrix.   The header is best described by a C structure:   struct header {   int magic;  // 4 bytes   int ndim;  // 4 bytes, little endian   int dim[3];  };    Note that when the matrix has less than 3 dimensions, say, it's a 1D vector,  then dim[1] and dim[2] are both 1. When the matrix has more than 3 dimensions,  the header will be followed by further dimension size information. Otherwise,  after the file header comes the matrix data, which is stored with the index  in the last dimension changes the fastest.   The magic number encodes the element type of the matrix:   - 0x1E3D4C51 for a single precision matrix   - 0x1E3D4C52 for a packed matrix   - 0x1E3D4C53 for a double precision matrix   - 0x1E3D4C54 for an integer matrix   - 0x1E3D4C55 for a byte matrix   - 0x1E3D4C56 for a short matrix    Since the files are generated on an Intel machine, they use the little-endian  scheme to encode the 4-byte integers. Pay attention when you read the files on  machines that use big-endian.   - The \"-dat\" files store a 4D tensor of dimensions 29160x2x108x108.  - The \"-cat\" files store a 1D vector of dimension 29,160.  - The \"-info\" files store a 2D matrix of dimensions 29160x10.    Here's a piece of Matlab code to show how to read some example files. (to avoid the endian confusion, we read bytes of the header):    >> fid=fopen('norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-dat.mat','r');   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [85 76 61 30], it's a byte matrix   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [4 0 0 0], ndim = 4   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [232 113 0 0], dim0 = 29160 (=113*256+232)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [2 0 0 0],  dim1 = 2   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [108 0 0 0], dim2 = 108   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % result = [108 0 0 0], dim3 = 108   >> imshow(transpose(reshape(fread(fid,108*108),108,108)),[0 255]); % show the first image     >> fid=fopen('norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-cat.mat','r');   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [84 76 61 30], integer matrix   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] ndim = 1   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [232 113 0 0] dim0 = 29160 (=113*256+232)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] (ignore this)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] (ignore this)   >> fread(fid,10,'int'); % [0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3] (on little-endian CPU)     >> fid=fopen('norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-info.mat','r');   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [84 76 61 30], integer matrix   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [2 0 0 0] ndim = 2   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [232 113 0 0] dim0 = 29160 (=113*256+232)   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [10 0 0 0] dim1 = 10   >> fread(fid,4,'uchar'); % [1 0 0 0] (ignore this)   >> fread(fid,10,'int'); % [8 5 10 4 -3 0 -6 1 0 -4] (on little-endian CPU)     Here is a screen shot of first 30 image pairs read from \"norb-5x46789x9x18x6x2x108x108-training-10-dat.mat\",  arranged topdown and left-to-right (column major).

When you are writing a paper or doing research on a topic, you must cite your sources. Academic or scholarly work requires a bibliography, which may also be referred to as a works cited page, a citations list, or a reference list. There are many reasons why citing your sources is important, and you must cite them in order to avoid plagiarism . There are various styles for citing sources; you will most likely find that you will need to use one style if you are writing a paper for a literature course and a different style if you are working in the sciences or social sciences.   How to use this guide :   Using the tabs near the top of this page, you should select the citation style appropriate for your field of study. In each tab, there are some basic examples of items you might be citing. For further examples or more detailed assistance, you may need to refer to a complete writing and style guide. Go to the More Style and Writing Guides tab for more information.   Citation management systems, like RefWorks or Endnote, are extremely useful for keeping track of, organizing, formatting, and sharing your reference lists. Go to the Formatting Tools tab for more information.   If you have questions about how to cite your sources or what style you should use, remember that you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, advisor, or a librarian. Good luck!   What Is Plagiarism?   Why Should You Cite Your Sources?   When Should You Cite Your Sources?           Comments (0)                                         What Is Plagiarism?                  Plagiarism (pronounced: play -juh-riz-um) is the act of taking someone else&rsquo;s words, ideas, or information and passing them off as your own. If you don&rsquo;t give credit to the author of these ideas in footnotes or endnotes and a bibliography, you are committing plagiarism, which is a serious academic offense.    Everything you find that is written, whether in print in books and journals, or on the web, should be considered copyrighted . That means that you should think of it as belonging to someone else. Information that you find on the web is not free to take or use &ndash; it is someone else&rsquo;s intellectual property . Any material lifted from an original source, including web resources, without proper acknowledgement or credit is considered plagiarized. Inadvertent or accidental plagiarism is still plagiarism. Plagiarism can inadvertently happen if you are not careful about taking notes while you research; it is sometimes difficult to remember exactly where your ideas came from when you are doing research, so remember to cite your sources while you work.   It is your responsibility to know what constitutes plagiarism. Not knowing citation standards is not an excuse. When in doubt, err on the side of over-documentation and cite the source. You can also ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help in determining what is and is not plagiarism.            Comments (0)                                         Why Should You Cite Your Sources?                 All scholarly or academic work requires  that you cite your sources, whether you are writing a long paper or a quick report. Why is citing your research so important?   Researching and writing a paper ideally involves a process of exploring and learning. By citing your sources, you are showing your reader how you came to your conclusions and acknowledging the other people's work that brought you to your conclusions. Citing your sources      Documents your research and   scholarship    Acknowledges the work of others   whose scholarship contributed to your work    Helps your reader understand   the context of your argument    Provides information for your   reader to use to locate additional information on your topic    Establishes the credibility of   your scholarship   Provides you with an opportunity to demonstrate your own integrity and understanding of academic ethics        Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Sometimes your professor or your discipline will have specific requirements about when and how to cite your sources. However, these are some guidelines that generally apply.    Always cite your sources when:       You quote verbatim from someone else's work.    You summarize or paraphrase someone else's work.    You are conveying information which may be unfamiliar to your reader (e.g. statistics or factual data).    You are not sure whether or not you need to cite. As mentioned above, when in doubt, err on the side of caution. It is better to give your reader more information rather than less .       Remember, if you have a question about whether or not you need to cite your source, you can ask your professor, teaching assistant, or a librarian for help. Sometimes citing your sources takes a little bit of time and effort, but it is worth it to avoid plagiarism.    Partially adapted from \"When and Why to Cite Sources.\" SUNY Albany. 2008.

Choosing between the two often depends on subject matter and   nature of sources cited, as each system is favored by different groups   of scholars. If you are unsure what system you should use for your paper, please ask your professor, teaching assistant, or publisher which you should follow.   The humanities style is preferred by many in literature, history, and   the arts. This style presents bibliographic information in notes and,   often, a bibliography. It accommodates a variety of sources, including   esoteric ones less appropriate to the author-date system.   The more concise author-date system has long been used by those in the   physical, natural, and social sciences. In this system, sources are briefly   cited in the text, usually in parentheses, by author&rsquo;s last name   and date of publication. The short citations are amplified in a list   of references, where full bibliographic information is provided.   You must choose to use either the notes and bibliography system ([N] and [B] below) or the author-date system ([T] and [R] below). Do not mix the two systems. Again, ask your professor if you are unsure which is preferred.

Is the author or publisher associated with a special-interest group, such as Greenpeace or the National Rifle Association, that might present only one side of an issue?   Are alternative views presented and addressed? How fairly does the author treat opposing views?   Does the author&rsquo;s language show signs of bias?     Assessing an argument       What is the author&rsquo;s central claim or thesis?   How does the author support this claim&mdash;with relevant and sufficient evidence or with just a few anecdotes or emotional examples?   Are statistics consistent with those you encounter in other sources? Have they been used fairly? Does the author explain where the statistics come from? (It is possible to &ldquo;lie&rdquo; with statistics by using them selectively or by omitting mathematical details.)   Are any of the author&rsquo;s assumptions questionable?   Does the author consider opposing arguments and refute them persuasively?   Does the author fall prey to any logical fallacies?      Evaluating Web sources   Authorship       Does the Web site or document have an author? You may need to do some clicking and scrolling to find the author&rsquo;s name. If you have landed directly on an internal page of a site, for example, you may need to navigate to the home page or find an &ldquo;about this site&rdquo; link to learn the name of the author.   If there is an author, can you tell whether he or she is knowledgeable and credible? When the author&rsquo;s qualifications aren&rsquo;t listed on the site itself, look for links to the author&rsquo;s home page, which may provide evidence of his or her interests and expertise.     Sponsorship       Who, if anyone, sponsors the site? The sponsor of a site is often named and described on the home page.   What does the URL tell you? The domain name extension often indicates the type of group hosting the site: commercial (.com), educational (.edu), nonprofit (.org), governmental (.gov), military (.mil), or network (.net). URLs may also indicate a country of origin: .uk (United Kingdom) or .jp (Japan), for instance.     Purpose and audience       Why was the site created: To argue a position? To sell a product? To inform readers?   Who is the site&rsquo;s intended audience?     Currency       How current is the site? Check for the date of publication or the latest update, often located at the bottom of the home page or at the beginning or end of an internal page.   How current are the site&rsquo;s links? If many of the links no longer work, the site may be too dated for your purposes.       Hacker, Diana and Barbara Fister. Research and Documentation . Bedford / St. Martin's, 2011.

I. A COMMUNITY OF THE MIND   The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any community, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, aptitude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him/her of an education. Most importantly, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. Thus, when students enter the College, one of the first things that they are asked to do is to sign a community compact, recognizing these principles of academic integrity. For this reason also, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness.   \" Nothing is more basic to living and working together than trust. Without it, as Thomas Hobbes warned, humanity is reduced to a &lsquo;war of all against all.' Trust is the condition of cooperation and of social relationships themselves. We learn as children not to be naively trusting, but instead to watch to see which people and which organizations deserve to be trusted. We are disappointed all too often. Law courts and religions try to make people more trustworthy. But being the sort of person who can be trusted is still a personal achievement. Trust does not depend on people putting aside their personal benefits, but on people pursuing them in ways that make them dependable partners to others. Thus lovers try to be faithful and friends loyal. Even in competition, trustworthiness is important. Not only are there punishments for those who cheat, but today's competitor may readily become tomorrow's colleague. An institution like a college depends enormously on trust. Students rightly expect professors to teach honestly and not deceive them. Society trusts scientists not to lie about the results of their research. Neither the pursuit of new knowledge nor the effort to preserve and pass on old wisdom can flourish unless we can trust each other to be intellectually honest. \" &mdash;Craig Calhoun, University Professor of the Social Sciences   II. SOME GUIDELINES   Academic honesty means that the work you submit - in whatever form - is original. Students are expected - often required - to build their work on that of other people, just as professional researchers and writers do. Giving credit to someone whose work has helped you is expected; in fact, not to give such credit is a crime. Plagiarism is the severest form of academic fraud. Plagiarism is theft. Obviously, bringing answers into an examination or copying all or part of a paper straight from a book, the Internet, or a fellow student is a violation of this principle. But there are other forms of cheating or plagiarizing which are just as serious, for example:     presenting an oral report drawn without attribution from other sources (oral or written);   writing a paragraph which, despite being in different words, expresses someone else's idea without a reference to the source of the idea;   submitting essentially the same paper in two different courses (unless both instructors have given their permission in advance);   giving or receiving help on a take-home examination or quiz unless expressly permitted by the instructor (as in collaborative projects)   presenting as your own a phrase, sentence, or passage from another writer's work without using quotation marks;   presenting as your own facts, ideas, or written text gathered or downloaded from the Internet;   submitting another student's work with your name on it;   purchasing a paper or \"research\" from a term paper mill;   \"collaborating\" between two or more students who then submit the same paper under their individual names.     Term paper mills (web sites and businesses set up to sell papers to students) often claim they are merely offering \"information\" or \"research\" to students and that this service is acceptable and allowed throughout the university. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNTRUE. If you buy and submit \"research,\" drafts, summaries, abstracts, or final versions of a paper, you are committing plagiarism and are subject to stringent disciplinary action. Since plagiarism is a matter of fact and not intention, it is crucial that you acknowledge every source accurately and completely. If you quote anything from a source, use quotation marks and take down the page number of the quotation to use in your footnote.   When in doubt about whether your acknowledgment is proper and adequate, consult your instructor. Show the instructor your sources and a draft of the paper in which you are using them. The obligation to demonstrate that work is your own rests with you, the student. You are responsible for providing sources, copies of your work, or verification of the date work was completed. While all this looks like a lot to remember, all you need to do is to give credit where it is due, take credit only for your original ideas, and ask your instructor or adviser when in doubt.   Consult the APA, MLA, or Chicago style guides for accepted forms of documentation. You can access these resources, as well as additional information on proper citations on the NYU Libraries Citation Style Guide .   III. PROCEDURES AND SANCTIONS   The penalty for academic dishonesty is severe. The following are the procedures as approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science. See also the College Bulletin .     If a student cheats on an examination or in laboratory work or engages in plagia-rism, appropriate disciplinary action should be taken. The Department can take the following actions: a) The faculty member, with the approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (Director), may reduce the student's grade or give the student an F in the course.  b) If after lowering the grade or assigning an F the department believes a more severe penalty (i.e., probation, suspension, expulsion) is warranted, it can refer the case to the Dean or his/her representative (Associate Dean for Students) for further action.   In all cases of either (a) or (b), the Director shall inform the Department Chair of any action in writing and send copies of this letter to the Dean and to the student. The letter shall include the nature of the offense, the penalty, and the right of the student to appeal such penalty. A copy of the letter shall be kept in a confidential chairman's file and not in the student's departmental file. The Dean's office copy shall also be kept in a confidential file. (The Professor and/or the Director is encouraged to meet with the student and discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken.)   For cases involving a first offense at New York University, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail a notice that a second offense will result in a one-semester suspension, or a more severe penalty. (The student is also called in to discuss the offense, and review the consequences of the disciplinary action.)   For cases involving a second offense, the Dean shall proceed as follows:  a) Upon receiving a second Director's letter concerning a given student, the Dean shall convene a three-member ad hoc committee, with no member being from the department involved, to examine the evidence. This ad hoc committee shall consider if there are reasonable grounds to believe that cheating/plagiarism has occurred and if so, shall affirm the suspension penalty. It shall report its conclusion to the Dean within three business days.  b) If the committee affirms the suspension, the Dean shall send the student by registered mail the suspension letter within two business days of receiving the report. The letter shall advise the student of his or her right to appeal. The student shall have two business days from the letter's delivery to request an appeal of the suspension as provided in Section 5 (below). The suspension shall ordinarily be stayed during the pendency of appeal.  c ) If the committee does not affirm the suspension, the report shall be kept on file for a one-year period.   The student in all cases has the right to appeal to the Dean. In the event of an appeal, the Dean shall elicit a written complaint from the faculty member and proceed as described above.

Comments (0)                                         Finding Slavic Studies Books in Bobcat and WorldCat                 BobCat follows the Library of Congress system of transliterating Cyrillic alphabets into Latin letters (see boxes to the left). Exceptions are some nineteenth-century personal names that follow widespread usage, such as Dostoyevsky (instead of Dostoevskii) and Tchaikovsky (instead of Chaikovskii).    Bear in mind that many Slavic place names changed in the course of the 20th century.
