The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

The strength of our Ph.D. program stems from the range of interests and expertise of our faculty in research, policy development and institutional leadership.    The curriculum includes an extensive and rigorous sequence of research courses that prepare students for the dissertation, which focuses on a question that requires the combined use of literature, and a research problem that is empirically investigated. The curriculum offers significant flexibility to ensure that students can construct an individualized program to support their research interests.    To be admitted to Ph.D. candidacy, students prepare and defend a candidacy paper, which is an analytical synthesis of the research and related scholarly literature on a researchable problem of significant interest to higher and postsecondary education. The Ph.D. dissertation will be an empirical study that results in the creation of new knowledge.    Although full time study is recommended, we also consider applications for part-time PhD study. Applicants are evaluated based on a number of factors, including their prior academic history; GRE scores; statements of interest, recommendations that sepak to their academic potential, and an interview with program faculty.    Program Outline    The Ph.D. program requires 54 points beyond the masters degree. Full-time students can generally complete the degree in three to five years. A limited number of Graduate Assistantships are available to support full-time study, NYU scholarships are also a possibility. More details are available in our current PhD Advising Guide.    The Curriculum    The curriculum requirements for the Program include:       Integrating Pro-Seminar (3) E98.3009    Foundations of Education (6) (Chosen from six course options in two categories)    Higher Education Specialization (18-24) 15 points core doctoral seminar plus 3-9 points chosen in consultation with advisor    Research (18) 6 points quantitative and 6 points qualitative plus 6 points advanced in dissertation focus advanced/specialized research chosen to support dissertation methodology    Cross-Disciplinary Cognate (6-9) E95.2054, Organization Theory, plus six points chosen in consultation with advisor    Dissertation Proposal Preparation (3) E98.3015                 This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

The strength of our Ph.D. program stems from the range of interests and expertise of our faculty in research, policy development and institutional leadership.    The curriculum includes an extensive and rigorous sequence of research courses that prepare students for the dissertation, which focuses on a question that requires the combined use of literature, and a research problem that is empirically investigated. The curriculum offers significant flexibility to ensure that students can construct an individualized program to support their research interests.    To be admitted to Ph.D. candidacy, students prepare and defend a candidacy paper, which is an analytical synthesis of the research and related scholarly literature on a researchable problem of significant interest to higher and postsecondary education. The Ph.D. dissertation will be an empirical study that results in the creation of new knowledge.    Although full time study is recommended, we also consider applications for part-time PhD study. Applicants are evaluated based on a number of factors, including their prior academic history; GRE scores; statements of interest, recommendations that sepak to their academic potential, and an interview with program faculty.    Program Outline    The Ph.D. program requires 54 points beyond the masters degree. Full-time students can generally complete the degree in three to five years. A limited number of Graduate Assistantships are available to support full-time study, NYU scholarships are also a possibility. More details are available in our current PhD Advising Guide.    The Curriculum    The curriculum requirements for the Program include:       Integrating Pro-Seminar (3) E98.3009    Foundations of Education (6) (Chosen from six course options in two categories)    Higher Education Specialization (18-24) 15 points core doctoral seminar plus 3-9 points chosen in consultation with advisor    Research (18) 6 points quantitative and 6 points qualitative plus 6 points advanced in dissertation focus advanced/specialized research chosen to support dissertation methodology    Cross-Disciplinary Cognate (6-9) E95.2054, Organization Theory, plus six points chosen in consultation with advisor    Dissertation Proposal Preparation (3) E98.3015                 This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
