Information on dates and signing up can be  found at http://cas.nyu.edu/page/placementexams .  If they wish to continue their study of the language at NYU they must consult  directly with the Director of the Language Program spanish.dlp@nyu.edu .

Students who have not taken a placement test and have taken Spanish before will not be allowed to stay in a course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Students with college Spanish from institutions other than NYU also need to take a placement test.

Since it is an adaptive test, the length varies from one individual to another, with an average time of 20 minutes. At the exam welcome screen students must provide their name, last name, NYU email and N number. The score and placement recommendation will be notified to the student and to the Department of Spanish and Portuguese immediately upon completion of the exam. Students must print their scores and bring them to class on the first week of classes.    Please be aware that the exam must represent each student\u2019s own work. Students are bound by New York University\u2019s College of Arts and Science Code of Academic Integrity ( http://cas.nyu.edu/page/academicintegrity ), and must abstain from activities constitutive of fraud.
