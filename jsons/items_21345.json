Home Since its establishment in 1923, the Department of Music at New York University has held a central position in American music scholarship and creativity. NYU faculty member Gustave Reese was one of the founding members of The American Musicological Society in 1934, and by mid-century the department had attracted a world-renowned group of scholars and musicians, from the pioneering musicologist Curt Sachs to composers of both concert and popular music such as Marion Bauer and Percy Grainger. Building on this legacy, the Department established its ethnomusicology sub-field in 1978, and a composition and theory sub-field in 1992. It has since grown into one of the country\u2019s most exciting, intellectually vibrant centers for the interdisciplinary study of music and sound. The NYU Department of Music offers studies in historical musicology, ethnomusicology, and composition and theory at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. With its leading research faculty, the Department grants degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy. The Department also sponsors a colloquium series, musical ensembles, graduate and undergraduate concerts, the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society concert series, and a range of interdisciplinary symposia/conferences. Our facilities include early and world music instrument collections, the Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media , and the Waverly Labs for Music and Computing , which provide faculty and students with equipment, lab and workshops spaces for research and creation in music and sound art.

Home > About Us     About Us Department Chronology                  The  Department of Music at Washington Square was established in 1923 with  Albert Stoessel as Acting Chairman, under the deanship of James Buell  Munn, then Dean of Washington Square College, to serve both the  Washington Square College and the College of Arts and Science at the  University Heights campus. Stoessel supervised the Heights music  programs and Philip James was assigned to Washington Square College.  For a period of four years between 1931 and 1935, the Music Department  at the Square was transferred to a short-lived College of Fine Arts  located in midtown. In 1935, the College was dissolved and the  Department was returned to the Washington Square College. During this  period, Alfred Greenfield was appointed Chairman at University  Heights, which continued to offer a purely undergraduate curriculum  with a B.A. in Liberal Arts. This satellite program was dissolved and  moved with the rest of the University Heights College in 1972 to the  Square.
