As a result, the short Weimar era inherited thousands of monuments, had to take care of them, deal with them, get rid of them. At the same time, the 1920s were forced to erect even more monuments, this time not to the Great Dead White Males but to a collective of three million dead white males. The period needed not only more but also different types of memorial sites. How did modernism contribute to this task? Wolfgang Kemp 's lecture How to Get Rid of a Monument and Replace It: A Contribution to the Memory Culture of Weimar Germany tries to show how Weimar Germany overcame the nineteenth-century concept of the monument stylistically as well as practically, especially in those cases where existing monuments were either added to and commented upon or replaced by new creations. The Lebensl\u00fcge , the intrinsic fallacy of the monument, is its claim to eternity. Weimar\u2019s creative contributions to memorial culture did not survive 1933. Wolfgang Kemp was born in Frankfurt/Main in 1946. He studied art history, German literature, and philosophy in T\u00fcbingen, Rome, M\u00fcnster, and Bonn. He earned his Ph.D. in 1970, his \"habilitation\" in 1978. He has been assistant professor at the University of Bonn and full professor at the universities of Kassel, Marburg, and Hamburg, and has served as Arts Council Lecturer at UCLA, as Volkswagen professor at Harvard, as Getty scholar at Santa Monica, as visiting professor at the Central European University Prag, and as fellow at the Wissenschaftskolleg Berlin. Presently he is a senior professor at the Leuphana University L\u00fcneburg. Among his numerous books on the history of photography, reception aesthetics, narratology, and the history of architecture are two publications published in English: The Desire of My Eyes: The Life and Work of John Ruskin (New York-London, 1991) and The Narratives of Gothic Stained Glass (Cambridge, 1997). His latest book is Foreign Affairs: Die Abenteuer einiger Engl\u00e4nder in Deutschland, 1900 bis 1947 , Munich 2010. Kemp is a regular contributor to newspapers and journals like Die Zeit , S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung , Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , and Merkur . Events at Deutsches Haus are free of charge.
