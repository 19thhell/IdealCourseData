The model grew out of the established elementary school model, while recognizing the unique needs of students in adolesence.    See below for tips for kids entering middle school , the Keeping it Real strengths-based project, and further video resources.          Making it in Middle School    Transitioning from elementary to middle school can be tough for any student, but particularly so for students with ASD. The ASD Nest Support Project created the following video to give fiftth graders some tips from current Nest middle schoolers.          Keeping it Real Project    Keeping it Real was a collaboration between self-advocates and the ASD Nest Support Project to develop strength-based modules&mdash;activities and curricula&mdash;for adolescent students with ASD.

The model grew out of the established elementary school model, while recognizing the unique needs of students in adolesence.    See below for tips for kids entering middle school , the Keeping it Real strengths-based project, and further video resources.          Making it in Middle School    Transitioning from elementary to middle school can be tough for any student, but particularly so for students with ASD. The ASD Nest Support Project created the following video to give fiftth graders some tips from current Nest middle schoolers.          Keeping it Real Project    Keeping it Real was a collaboration between self-advocates and the ASD Nest Support Project to develop strength-based modules&mdash;activities and curricula&mdash;for adolescent students with ASD.

It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experiments. The discoveries of physics, exemplified by the laws of physics, rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry, and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department carry out research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics. Experimental work is carried out in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at national and international facilities such as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and astronomical telescopes in space. The majority of NYU physics graduates go to graduate school in physics, and the rest pursue careers in medicine, finance, engineering and law. 27 percent of majors are women; 5% black, 16% Asian, and 8% Latino.      The NYU SPS chapter organizes a mentoring program that pairs first-year students with upper division Physics Majors, organizes lunches for students, and sponsors weekly sessions where faculty are invited to discuss their research. There are many opportunities for faculty-student interaction. These include the weekly colloquium and weekly events such as the CCPP (Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics) Brown Bag, in which faculty present talks on their research.       The educational programs of the Department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside physics there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for non-science majors there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world.      Faculty       Professors Emeriti:    Bederson, Borowitz, Brown, Glassgold, Hoffert, Levy, Lowenstein, Richardson, Robinson, Rosenberg, Sculli, Yarmus      Silver Professors; Professors of Physics:    Chaikin, Dvali, Pine      Collegiate Professors; Professors of Physics:    Farrar, Mincer      Professors:    Budick, Gabadadze, Grier, Grosberg, Hohenberg, Kent, Nemethy, Percus, Porrati, Schucking, Sokal, Stein, Stroke, Zhang, Zwanziger      Associate Professors:   Blanton, Gruzinov, Hogg, Kleban, MacFadyen, Mitra, Scoccimarro, Sleator, Weiner      Assistant Professors:    Brujic, Cranmer, Dubovsky, Gershow, Haas, Modjaz, Wyart      Clinical Associate Professor:    Adler            Program       DEPARTMENTAL OBJECTIVES       Majors: The Major programs are designed to meet a number of goals: They provide good preparation for graduate school; indeed many of the Majors go on to some of the world's best graduate programs. They develop a range of technical skills, most of which relate to the challenging intellectual problems of building quantitative theoretical models and making precise measurements of physically interesting phenomena. The Major programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire Universe.      The Major programs are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in Years 3 and 4 to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or go into greater depth in a subject or into original research.      The Department is a collegial place where the faculty and the students get to know one another well; there are regular formal and informal seminars; there is a thriving Society of Physics Students; and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many of the Majors participate in original research and co-author scientific publications. For all of these reasons, and in addition to the rigor of the courses, the Majors are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineering pursuits\u2014or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems is necessary and rewarded.      Non-majors: For non-science majors, there are non-technical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact on the contemporary world. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that bring breadth or ideas about fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The Department provides courses designed to meet the pre-professional goals of pre-health students and students in engineering disciplines.      Minors: There are Minor programs in Physics and Astrophysics for students who are interested in obtaining significant experience in the ideas of physics without committing to the Major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background.

HONORS PROGRAM       Candidates for a degree with honors in physics must complete the requirements for the B.A. Major described above. They must also complete the equivalent of a semester of experimental or theoretical research. Students who wish to fulfill this requirement should discuss possible options, such as independent study courses, with the director of undergraduate studies.
