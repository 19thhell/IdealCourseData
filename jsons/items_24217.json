Natl. Acad.

In situ atomic force microscopy of step propagation on pathologicalL-cystine crystals did indeed show spirals and islands with step heights of one lattice displacement. We show by analysis of the rates of growth of smaller steps only one molecule high that the major morphological spirals and loops are actually consequences of the bunching of the smaller steps. The morphology of the bunched steps actually inverts the predictions of the theory: Spirals arise from pairs of dislocations, loops from single dislocations. Only through numerical simulation of the growth is it revealed how normal growth of anisotropic layers of molecules within the highly symmetrical crystals can conspire to create features in apparent violation of the classic theory.

Tying the Knot -- with Computer-Generated Holograms     A computer-generated hologram projects a beam of light that focuses to interlocking inclined rings, a simple knot known as a Hopf link. Each ring acts as an optical trap that can gather and hold micrometer-scale objects. The same hologram also imposes phase gradients around the Hopf link, thereby creating a knot in the total optical force field.               Summer 2013 MRSEC REU Program     Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) fellowships are awarded to undergraduates from four-year colleges and universities for participation in a ten-week summer program.

Natl. Acad. Sci. 2013    The theory of dislocation-controlled crystal growth identifies a continuous spiral step with an emergent lattice displacement on a crystal surface; a mechanistic corollary is that closely spaced, oppositely winding spirals merge to form concentric loops. In situ atomic force microscopy of step propagation on pathologicalL-cystine crystals did indeed show spirals and islands with step heights of one lattice displacement. We show by analysis of the rates of growth of smaller steps only one molecule high that the major morphological spirals and loops are actually consequences of the bunching of the smaller steps. The morphology of the bunched steps actually inverts the predictions of the theory: Spirals arise from pairs of dislocations, loops from single dislocations. Only through numerical simulation of the growth is it revealed how normal growth of anisotropic layers of molecules within the highly symmetrical crystals can conspire to create features in apparent violation of the classic theory.
