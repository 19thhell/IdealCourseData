Conflict of Interest , as discussed in greater detail in Section IV and in the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, means any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial or other interests of an individual (including the Immediate Family Members of the individual) may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her professional obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. A Conflict of Interest may exist whenever an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions, including the ethical and objective conduct of scholarship, research or clinical care, are determined by considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise. A conflict of interest under the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects constitutes a Conflict of Interest under this policy.   Consulting refers to any remunerated Outside Activity involving an individual\u2019s professional competence.   Employment/Management/Fiduciary Role means a position involving service, in either a personal or representative capacity, as an employee, executive, manager, officer, director, trustee, or equivalent in a business, enterprise or entity other than NYU or an entity that is 50% or more owned or controlled by NYU.   Entity includes the entity itself and entities that own or control, are owned or controlled by or are under common ownership or control with the entity, with ownership and control defined as a 50% or greater direct or indirect interest.   Immediate Family Members include an individual\u2019s spouse or domestic partner or person in a civil union or similar relationship, dependent children, and any other family members residing in the same household.   Investigator means the principal investigator or program director, and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of Research and Other Sponsored Projects, or who proposes funding for the Research and Other Sponsored Projects, at or under the auspices of NYU For purposes of this policy, other than for the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, Investigator only includes members of the University Community. Most, but not all, Investigators are NYU faculty members.   NYU includes the Schools and other units of NYU, NYU\u2019s Global Network University sites, and all University Affiliates (as each term is defined in NYU\u2019s Policy on Policies, as amended from time to time).   Outside Activities include any external Consulting or other business activities and external professional or academic endeavors, such as public service or pro bono work, performed outside of the faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU or an Investigator\u2019s employment or association with NYU.   Ownership Interest means holding a financial or ownership interest in a business or entity, including stock, stock option, warrant, convertible debt, partnership interest, or LLP/LLC interest, or other ownership interest or right to obtain an ownership interest. The value of an Ownership Interest is determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value where public prices are not available.   Remuneration includes salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid editorial or authorship activities, travel reimbursement and travel paid). Honoraria paid, travel paid and travel reimbursements by a federal, state, or local government agency, or a non-profit institution of higher education, an academic teaching hospital, a medical center or a research institute, for scholarly and professional activities performed in connection with a faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU, such as lectures or seminars, editorial or authorship activities, service on advisory committees or review panels (including professional associations), are excluded from the definition of Remuneration.   Research and Other Sponsored Projects means any research project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU, whether or not externally funded, and any externally funded training or professional service project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU. Research and Other Sponsored Projects includes any systematic investigation, study or experiment designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, including basic and applied research (e.g., a published article, book or book chapter) and product development (e.g., a diagnostic test, drug or device), and non-research projects such as training, clinical services, educational conferences, exhibitions, performances, archives, workshops, and library projects for which external funding is received. Research and Other Sponsored Projects includes any such activity for which funding is available from external sources through a grant, contract or agreement, including, but not limited to, research grants, career development awards, center grants, individual fellowship awards, infrastructure awards, institutional training grants, program projects and research resources awards.   School means each NYU school, college and institute that functions similarly to a school or college (such as IFA, ISAW, Courant and CUSP), each NYU comprehensive campus (such as New York and Abu Dhabi) and also may include for purposes of this policy other global sites as designated by the Provost.   School Dean means the dean, or his or her designee, of each NYU school and college, the director or each NYU institute that functions similarly to a school or college (such as IFA, ISAW, Courant and CUSP) and the Vice Chancellor of each NYU comprehensive campus (such as New York and Abu Dhabi). In the case of other NYU global sites that have faculty and/or Investigators, the Provost may designate someone to fulfill some or all of the duties of a School Dean as described herein with respect to such global sites.   University Community means NYU faculty, including visiting faculty; researchers, including persons participating in research at or under the auspices of NYU; employees; professional staff, including medical, dental and nursing staff; volunteers; fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; students; and consultants, vendors and contractors.

Conflict of Interest , as discussed in greater detail in Section IV and in the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, means any circumstance in which the personal, professional, financial or other interests of an individual (including the Immediate Family Members of the individual) may potentially or actually diverge from, or may be reasonably perceived as potentially or actually diverging from, his or her professional obligations to NYU and the interests of NYU. A Conflict of Interest may exist whenever an independent observer might reasonably question whether the individual's professional actions or decisions, including the ethical and objective conduct of scholarship, research or clinical care, are determined by considerations of personal gain, financial or otherwise. A conflict of interest under the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects constitutes a Conflict of Interest under this policy.   Consulting refers to any remunerated Outside Activity involving an individual\u2019s professional competence.   Employment/Management/Fiduciary Role means a position involving service, in either a personal or representative capacity, as an employee, executive, manager, officer, director, trustee, or equivalent in a business, enterprise or entity other than NYU or an entity that is 50% or more owned or controlled by NYU.   Entity includes the entity itself and entities that own or control, are owned or controlled by or are under common ownership or control with the entity, with ownership and control defined as a 50% or greater direct or indirect interest.   Immediate Family Members include an individual\u2019s spouse or domestic partner or person in a civil union or similar relationship, dependent children, and any other family members residing in the same household.   Investigator means the principal investigator or program director, and any other person, regardless of title or position, who is responsible for the design, conduct or reporting of Research and Other Sponsored Projects, or who proposes funding for the Research and Other Sponsored Projects, at or under the auspices of NYU For purposes of this policy, other than for the Addendum on Conflicts of Interest in Research and Other Sponsored Projects, Investigator only includes members of the University Community. Most, but not all, Investigators are NYU faculty members.   NYU includes the Schools and other units of NYU, NYU\u2019s Global Network University sites, and all University Affiliates (as each term is defined in NYU\u2019s Policy on Policies, as amended from time to time).   Outside Activities include any external Consulting or other business activities and external professional or academic endeavors, such as public service or pro bono work, performed outside of the faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU or an Investigator\u2019s employment or association with NYU.   Ownership Interest means holding a financial or ownership interest in a business or entity, including stock, stock option, warrant, convertible debt, partnership interest, or LLP/LLC interest, or other ownership interest or right to obtain an ownership interest. The value of an Ownership Interest is determined through reference to public prices or other reasonable measures of fair market value where public prices are not available.   Remuneration includes salary and any payment for services not otherwise identified as salary (e.g., consulting fees, honoraria, paid editorial or authorship activities, travel reimbursement and travel paid). Honoraria paid, travel paid and travel reimbursements by a federal, state, or local government agency, or a non-profit institution of higher education, an academic teaching hospital, a medical center or a research institute, for scholarly and professional activities performed in connection with a faculty member\u2019s appointment to NYU, such as lectures or seminars, editorial or authorship activities, service on advisory committees or review panels (including professional associations), are excluded from the definition of Remuneration.   Research and Other Sponsored Projects means any research project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU, whether or not externally funded, and any externally funded training or professional service project conducted at or under the auspices of NYU. Research and Other Sponsored Projects includes any systematic investigation, study or experiment designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge, including basic and applied research (e.g., a published article, book or book chapter) and product development (e.g., a diagnostic test, drug or device), and non-research projects such as training, clinical services, educational conferences, exhibitions, performances, archives, workshops, and library projects for which external funding is received. Research and Other Sponsored Projects includes any such activity for which funding is available from external sources through a grant, contract or agreement, including, but not limited to, research grants, career development awards, center grants, individual fellowship awards, infrastructure awards, institutional training grants, program projects and research resources awards.   School means each NYU school, college and institute that functions similarly to a school or college (such as IFA, ISAW, Courant and CUSP), each NYU comprehensive campus (such as New York and Abu Dhabi) and also may include for purposes of this policy other global sites as designated by the Provost.   School Dean means the dean, or his or her designee, of each NYU school and college, the director or each NYU institute that functions similarly to a school or college (such as IFA, ISAW, Courant and CUSP) and the Vice Chancellor of each NYU comprehensive campus (such as New York and Abu Dhabi). In the case of other NYU global sites that have faculty and/or Investigators, the Provost may designate someone to fulfill some or all of the duties of a School Dean as described herein with respect to such global sites.   University Community means NYU faculty, including visiting faculty; researchers, including persons participating in research at or under the auspices of NYU; employees; professional staff, including medical, dental and nursing staff; volunteers; fellows, trainees and post-doctoral appointees; students; and consultants, vendors and contractors.

Semester: Spring, Summer, Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           The public/non-profit administrator, whether primarily concerned with management, policy or finance, is called upon to manage or becomes involved in a wide variety of conflicts. Conflict is ubiquitous - within and between organizations and agencies, between levels of government, between interest groups and government, between interest groups, between citizens and agencies, etc. The increasing complexity and interrelatedness of the issues that the public sector is called upon to address, and the increasing sophistication and engagement of groups representing both public and private interests, compounds the challenge. In this environment, it is essential for public and non-profit administrators to know how to manage conflict effectively.      Effective conflict management involves analyzing a conflict, understanding the dynamics between the parties, and determining the appropriate method of conflict resolution. In the absence of confidence and skill in conflict management, most public officials resort, often counterproductively, to the use of power, manipulation, and control. Possessing confidence and skill, one can exercise other options.      Through readings, discussions, and simulations you will develop an understanding of conflict dynamics and the art and science of negotiation and will be introduced to the role that can be played by conflict resolution techniques such as mediation. The course will emphasize the theoretical as well as the practical, the reflective as well as the applied. I encourage you to keep a journal, as you should learn a lot about yourself regarding your relationship to conflict and negotiation and the ways you typically deal with them; you will be asked to report on that learning during the course.
