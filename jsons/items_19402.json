The labs concentrate on research related to the development, deployment, and utilization of advanced biomimetic smart systems and materials, and electromechanical systems.   Educating Tomorrow&rsquo;s Engineers   Our programs offer students diverse and multidimensional education that addresses fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematics, sciences, and engineering; design methodologies; use of modern simulation and design tools; and extensive laboratories for undergraduate and graduate instruction and research.   Our mission is to prepare students for careers in mechanical and related engineering disciplines for professional development, life-long learning, and contributions to society.   We seek to add value to our students&rsquo; career potential by placing an emphasis on (a) understanding the physical world through project, tools, and practice; and (b) providing the foundation tools for innovation, invention and entrepreneurship.   The department offers BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering. It also offers an Minor in Aerospace Engineering and an Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear science and Engineering.   The Profession   Mechanical engineering is a dynamic and continually evolving profession and the most diverse among all engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers develop the physical systems and devices that modern society needs or wants, from automobiles to air conditioning, robots to power plants, people movers to artificial limbs and rocket engines to communications satellites.   Mechanical engineering also has a long tradition of leadership in helping to develop the natural environment by breaking new ground in such areas as resource conservation, improved efficiency of energy-consuming devices, development of codes for a safer technological environment, new energy sources and the like.   Undergraduate and graduate programs in mechanical engineering are designed primarily to develop talents in such areas as design of components, fluid and thermal systems, controls and robotic systems and computer-integrated mechanical and electromechanical systems. However, many graduating students eventually apply their training to the additional diversified fields of computer engineering, nanotechnology, software development, financial engineering, bioengineering, manufacturing, astronautics, systems engineering and corporate management and law. As students mature and realize their abilities, their professional lives may center on engineering research, government, business or education.

The main research in the department in carried out through 4 laboratories: the Applied Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory, the Mechatronics Laboratory, Composite Materials and Mechanics Laboratory, and the Dynamical Systems Laboratory . The labs concentrate on research related to the development, deployment, and utilization of advanced biomimetic smart systems and materials, and electromechanical systems.   Educating Tomorrow&rsquo;s Engineers   Our programs offer students diverse and multidimensional education that addresses fundamental understanding of the underlying mathematics, sciences, and engineering; design methodologies; use of modern simulation and design tools; and extensive laboratories for undergraduate and graduate instruction and research.   Our mission is to prepare students for careers in mechanical and related engineering disciplines for professional development, life-long learning, and contributions to society.   We seek to add value to our students&rsquo; career potential by placing an emphasis on (a) understanding the physical world through project, tools, and practice; and (b) providing the foundation tools for innovation, invention and entrepreneurship.   The department offers BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Mechanical Engineering. It also offers an Minor in Aerospace Engineering and an Interdisciplinary Minor in Nuclear science and Engineering.   The Profession   Mechanical engineering is a dynamic and continually evolving profession and the most diverse among all engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineers develop the physical systems and devices that modern society needs or wants, from automobiles to air conditioning, robots to power plants, people movers to artificial limbs and rocket engines to communications satellites.   Mechanical engineering also has a long tradition of leadership in helping to develop the natural environment by breaking new ground in such areas as resource conservation, improved efficiency of energy-consuming devices, development of codes for a safer technological environment, new energy sources and the like.   Undergraduate and graduate programs in mechanical engineering are designed primarily to develop talents in such areas as design of components, fluid and thermal systems, controls and robotic systems and computer-integrated mechanical and electromechanical systems. However, many graduating students eventually apply their training to the additional diversified fields of computer engineering, nanotechnology, software development, financial engineering, bioengineering, manufacturing, astronautics, systems engineering and corporate management and law. As students mature and realize their abilities, their professional lives may center on engineering research, government, business or education.   Department History   The history of the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department can be traced to 1899 when Polytechnic established its original Mechanical Engineering Department. In 1931, it began offering its first classes in aeronautical engineering: Airplane Designs and Aerodynamics, and Airplane Structures. And in 1941 began granting master&rsquo;s degrees in aerospace engineering.

This course introduces students to the foundations of computer science. Students learn how to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs using a high-level programming language. The course covers core programming concepts including: basic computation; data structure; control structure; iterative structures; file I/O and exception handling; recursion, sorting, searching, and functions. Students also learn the elements of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), such as objects, classes, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, and interface. OOP is a programming paradigm used to solve complex systems. Students produce programs focusing on scientific concepts, graphics, games, and web CGI implementation. Students design, test, and develop innovative software applications such as games, interactive websites, and other projects related to different fields.

This course aims to introduce the students to these laws namely&mdash;the conservation of mass, conservation of force and linear momentum, conservation of torque and angular momentum, conservation of energy, conservation of chemical species, and conservation of charge&mdash;that are derived in integral forms. Selected case studies are used to demonstrate the application of these laws for the simplification of complex engineering problems. In addition, this course also helps the students develop a deeper understanding of the concepts of work and heat.

Techniques to compare, analyze and report different measurements are studied. Students are introduced to error propagation rules, random and systematic errors and standard deviation as the uncertainty in a single measurement.

Its structure includes a process of design with measurable metrics, and incorporation of appropriate engineering standards and multiple realistic constraints. Emphasis is placed on clearly framing the design problem and following the design process to result in an optimized design solution. Students are encouraged to build prototypes of their designs and seek validation of their solutions through simulations and experiments, as appropriate.    The Capstone Project aims to be collaborative and trans-disciplinary across several engineering streams. The emphasis is on students applying the design process to solve real-world problems in a 21st century, global context. The projects address engineering and technology topics that overlap with the sciences, social sciences, liberal arts or business. The Capstone provides an opportunity to integrate technical, human, aesthetic, business and ethical concerns with engineering design. Students practice critical skills in communication, team-building, and project management. There is a mid-semester review of the projects. Students complete their design, as well as build and test their prototypes, if applicable, in spring semester. The senior year culminates in a comprehensive project report and design review by a committee of faculty and other professionals.    Capstone Seminar (ENGR-AD-400), Capstone Design Project I (ENGR-AD-401) and Capstone Design Project II (ENGR-AD-402) collectively offer the engineering capstone experience to seniors. Capstone Seminar (Fall) and Capstone Design Project I (Fall) are two credits each. Capstone seminar focuses on skill building, project management and Ethics. Capstone Design Project I focus on different aspects of the capstone project such as problem definition and creating the design solution. Capstone Design Project II in spring consists of two, seven week modules. The design solution proposed in Capstone Design Project I is implemented in the first module. It is tested and validated in Module II.    Prerequisite is Senior Standing    (2 credits Fall semester)    *Students must take ENGR-AD 400 and 401 concurrently.

While the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function, the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval. Indeed, the relationship between differentiation (finding a derivative) and integration (determining an integral) is described in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly discussion section that provides opportunities for rigorous analysis of proofs and theorems associated with the material. This course is primarily intended for students considering Mathematics as a major or for students who seek an in-depth understanding of the arguments that support calculus. Placement into Calculus is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination. With permission of the program in mathematics, Calculus with Applications may substitute for Calculus.    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017.

Applications to natural science, engineering, and the social sciences, particularly economics, are emphasized. Since the derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of a function and the definite integral measures the total accumulation of a function over an interval, these two ideas form the basis for nearly all mathematical formulas in science, engineering, economics, and other fields. This course also provides instruction in how to model situations in order to solve problems. Applications include graphing, and maximizing and minimizing functions. In addition to two weekly lectures, students attend a weekly discussion section focused on applications of calculus in science, engineering, or social science, depending on their primary interest. Placement into Calculus with Applications is decided by discussion with mentors and the results of a mathematics placement examination.    May not be taken if MATH-AD 110 Calculus is completed    This is a required course for Economics majors until the class of 2017. This course can be substituted with MATH-AD 110 Calculus.    Please note: During Summer 2014, classes will be held on Thursday May 22 and Saturday May 24, and then on Sunday through Thursday from May 28-June 19. Exams will be held on Saturday May 21.

These linear systems, which arise in elasticity, in electrical engineering, and in economics for example, involve linear equations in many unknowns. The associated matrix algebra is a rich and beautiful field of mathematics. It is also central to the analysis of linear ordinary and partial differential equations. The material in this course includes systems of linear equations, Gaussian elimination, matrices, determinants, Cramer&rsquo;s rule, vectors, vector spaces, basis and dimension, linear transformations, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and quadratic forms.

Newton&rsquo;s equations of motion, the rate equations of chemical reactions, the currents flowing in electric circuits, all can be expressed as ordinary differential equations. The solutions of these equations usually evolve a combination of analytic and numerical methods. The course studies first- and second-order equations, solutions using infinite series, Laplace transforms, linear systems, numerical methods.    MATH-AD 116 is a corequisite.

Following an introduction to the physical sciences, the course focuses on velocity, acceleration, forces, and energy, while simultaneously introducing students to atoms and molecules. Chemical reactions are examined, and the energy changes associated with them are investigated via a thorough analysis of the three laws of thermodynamics. Laboratory exercises focus on the guiding principles of the scientific method and an introduction to experimental design, and scientific presentation, including technical writing. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Concurrently, atomic theory, the theory of molecular bonding, and atomic and molecular structures and shapes, in which forces and energy play a role, are investigated. Students apply these concepts to understanding molecules related to the life sciences. Laboratory exercises focus on acquisition of data and analysis with a continued emphasis on technical presentation. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

Capacitors, current, and basic circuits are explored with an eye toward understanding their applications to chemical reactions and the behavior of living cells. The rates and directions of chemical reactions are explored as chemical kinetics and chemical equilibrium are investigated with a special focus on acid-base chemistry. These fundamental physical and chemical principles are used to describe basic cellular monomers and polymers including DNA, RNA, and protein, and the sequence of events that leads to information flow and its regulation in the cell nucleus. They are also applied to macroscopic systems found in the biosphere. Laboratory exercises focus on fundamental protocols and tools needed to sharpen basic laboratory skills. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.

This leads to another question: If a specific function is desired, can a form or shape be engineered or modified to execute or improve that function? The course examines the form/function concept in magnetic and electrical fields, the behavior and design of small molecules, and the activity of proteins as the workhorse in biological systems. Laboratory exercises require students to design experiments related to crystals and crystallography, and to examine chemical forms at the macroscopic and microscopic levels. Weekly discussion sections are designed to hone proficiency at solving problems in a collaborative, team environment.
