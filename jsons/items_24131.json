The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

Through visits to universities and public and private colleges, we will engage in discussions with rectors, faculty members, deans of students and their staffs and students themselves. Special lectures with sociologists and national officials will help us understand the goals and future aspirations of Israeli higher education and how higher education meets the social, political and cultural needs of society. In addition to preparatory meetings at NYU, students will participate in a two-week field trip to Israel that will provide an in-depth case study of its higher education system. Includes lectures from scholars and visits to eight Israeli colleges and universities to meet with faculty, administrators and students. Additional sessions will be held with directors of the national Council on Higher Education and a recent government commission on the future of higher education. Topics will include curricular opportunities; college admissions requirements; distribution of students by class and ethnicity; college climate and the student services offered.

The Master of Arts program focuses on entry- and midlevel positions in student activities, enrollment management, financial aid, housing and residence life, student life, career services, and similar opportunities in student affairs. Doctoral programs help individuals develop competencies in such areas as urban college leadership, policy analysis, student affairs, institutional research, fiscal management, and international higher education. Students benefit from strong links with two- and four-year institutions in the metropolitan New York area as well as the frequent and close interaction among students, faculty, and NYU administrators.    The Master of Arts in Business and Workplace Education, the Advanced Certificate in Workplace Learning, and the Post-Master's Certificate in Workplace Education focus on careers as teachers of business subjects in community colleges and private (for-profit) business schools and as learning and development specialists who can develop curriculum, administer instruction, and teach within business, industry, and government.    New York University&rsquo;s Program in Higher and Postsecondary Education offers two doctoral programs: the Ph.D. program in higher and postsecondary education and the Ed.D. program in higher and postsecondary education. Both programs emphasize broad knowledge of the field, including an international dimension; issues of access and equity; state and federal policy; student learning and development; workplace learning; and institutional development and assessment. While the programs share some commonalities, the goals and objectives are quite different. The Ph.D. program is a research degree designed for students who aspire to conduct research throughout their careers in roles such as faculty, researchers, government employees, policy scholars, or institutional researchers. The Ed.D. program, on the other hand, is designed for current practitioners who aspire to senior leadership positions in colleges, universities, and other public and private organizations and who may occasionally participate in designing research studies but will more frequently use their knowledge gained in the program to interpret the research of others for their own institution.

Through visits to universities and public and private colleges, we will engage in discussions with rectors, faculty members, deans of students and their staffs and students themselves. Special lectures with sociologists and national officials will help us understand the goals and future aspirations of Israeli higher education and how higher education meets the social, political and cultural needs of society. In addition to preparatory meetings at NYU, students will participate in a two-week field trip to Israel that will provide an in-depth case study of its higher education system. Includes lectures from scholars and visits to eight Israeli colleges and universities to meet with faculty, administrators and students. Additional sessions will be held with directors of the national Council on Higher Education and a recent government commission on the future of higher education. Topics will include curricular opportunities; college admissions requirements; distribution of students by class and ethnicity; college climate and the student services offered.
