Over the past 15 years, a small telescope in New Mexico has produced the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the most complete map of the observable universe ever made, yielding a three-dimensional picture of how galaxies are distributed out to eight billion light years away. In his presentation, Blanton will describe why and how astronomers have achieved this\u2014and what its plans are for the future.   Blanton, an associate professor in NYU\u2019s Department of Physics, is the director of Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, which will create the largest-ever three-dimensional map of the distant universe.   The event, part of the NYU College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 Bentson Dean\u2019s Lecture Series, is free and open to the public. Call 212.992.9817 for more information.
