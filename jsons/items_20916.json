This interest coincides with an interest in histories of mobility generated by contemporary discourses of the global. It has taken a variety of forms, from attention to the modalities and effects of circulation - the result of diplomatic exchange and gifting, long-distance trade, or looting and reuse, for example - to research on media and regions that lie on the margins of the Islamic world, or outside the traditional boundaries of the canon. Points of Contact introduces some of the exciting new scholarship generated by these developments.           2015                 April 23, 2015       Art and Architecture of the Deccan: A Conversation       Navina\u00a0Haidar ,\u00a0 Curator of Islamic Art , Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York      and           Phillip B.
