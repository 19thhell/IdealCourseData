Using the incomparable theatrical resources of New York City as well as the superb intellectual assets of New York University, the Department has created a B.F.A. (Bachelor of Fine Arts) program that aims to establish the artistic and intellectual foundations for a successful and sustained life in the professional theatre and allied disciplines. In partnership with some of the country\u2019s foremost professional theatre training institutions, we offer comprehensive conservatory training in acting, directing, musical performance, production, design and stage management. Equally emphasized is our expansive and innovative theatre studies curriculum, unparalleled in its scope. The curriculum is further enriched by required general education courses in the humanities and sciences. The program is framed by a vast and varied schedule of productions that often involve world-famous guest artists. Our faculty comprises over 270 artists and scholars. These include resident tenured academic professors, resident artistic master teachers, academic adjuncts, and full- and part-time artistic teachers in our affiliated studios. The size and range of our faculty allows us to offer the most culturally, scholarly, and artistically diverse undergraduate theatre training curricula in the country. Our core faculty is enhanced by a constant influx of prominent visiting artists and scholars. The curriculum for a Drama student is represented by four components:  Professional Training There are two phases of professional training in the Department of Drama: a primary training phase and an advanced training phase. The primary training phase occurs in your first two years and provides   students with intensive conservatory training towards a strong   foundation in technique. Upon acceptance into the Department, students   are placed into one of eight different primary training studios where   they learn the skills needed to proceed onto an advanced level of   training. Students remain in their primary training studio for four   consecutive semesters to complete a progressive curriculum. Each   semester builds upon the last. The advanced training phase begins   once primary training is completed. Students may take advantage of a   variety of additional professional training options, which include   advanced training at their own or other primary studios, more   specialized training, study abroad and internships.  Theatre Studies Theatre Studies are taught in the Department of Drama by a faculty rich with internationally recognized scholars. Courses focus on the theoretical and historical aspects of the work students are engaged in at their studios. The curriculum covers areas such as theatre history, dramatic literature, dramatic theory and criticism, and world drama. We have a series of courses in Applied Theatre, which takes theatre out of its traditional context and applies it to areas like education, therapy, community-based initiatives, political activism, and theater in prisons.  General Education General Education (or Liberal Arts) courses take our students out into the College of Arts and Science at NYU. The freedom in our General Education requirements allows students to pursue other academic interests through a double-major or minor in another subject or by following a course of study based on their own scholarly passions. In most cases, if pursued at the College of Arts and Science, a student will be able to complete a double-major or minor without requiring extra time at NYU.  Electives Electives can be fulfilled by additional courses in professional training or academic curriculum or with artistic electives offered by the department, such as: stage combat, private voice lessons, dance classes and audition technique (where industry professionals are brought in to work with students). These are but a sampling of the numerous artistic electives found in the Department of Drama. Want to know more? Click here to Visit Us!
