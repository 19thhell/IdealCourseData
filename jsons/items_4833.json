Water is a polar molecule    A water molecule is formed when two atoms of hydrogen bond covalently with an atom of oxygen. In a covalent bond electrons are shared between atoms. In water the sharing is not equal. The oxygen atom attracts the electrons more strongly than the hydrogen.This gives water an asymmetrical distribution of charge.

The positive regions in one water will attract the negatively charged regions in other waters. The dashes show the hydrogen bond. In a hydrogen bond a hydrogen atom is shared by two other atoms.

In ice Ih, each water forms four hydrogen bonds with O---O distances of 2.76 Angstroms to the nearest oxygen neighbor. The O-O-O angles are 109 degrees, typical of a tetrahedrally coordinated lattice structure. The density of ice Ih is 0.931 gm/cubic cm. This compares with a density of 1.00 gm/cubic cm. for water.    There are eleven different forms of crystalline ice that are know. The hexaganol form known as ice Ih is the only one that is found naturally. The lattice structure of ice 1h is shown here.

GRADE      States of Water  Water   exists in three states- solid, liquid, and gaseous.

You see liquid water coming out of the faucet,   when it rains, and running in a river. Pure liquid water is free of salt, rocks,   soil, and garbage.  Solid Water-    Ice,   snow, and frost are examples of water in the solid state. Liquid water freezes   at 0 degrees Celsius. Celsius is scale that measures temperature. What instrument   do you use to measure temperature? Winter is a season that you see a lot of solid   water. Other examples of solid water are ice cubes, icicles, ice on a skating   rink.  Water as a Gas - Look   at this picture of gas  You   don't see anything because gas is invisible. Water in the   liquid state may change to water in the gaseous state. Water evaporates   to turn into a gas. Gases are colorless and odorless. You cannot see gas ,but   sometimes you can hear it and smell it. What are some ways that you can hear or   smell a gas?  Water can evaporate or disappear with   the help of heat. Changes in temperature can increase the rate or how long   it takes water to evaporate . Evaporate means to disappear. Water can evaporate   from soil. It evaporates off wet clothes hanging on a clothesline. Plants release   water vapor into the air. We breathe out water vapor.  TRY   THIS!!!   1.

Do not blow. When you are done,   feel your palm. What does it feel like? Is it wet or dry? Your   palm should have felt wet to you. That moist feeling was water vapor. Remember   that we breathe out water vapor. If you have a dog or a cat, you can feel the   water vapor that they breathe out. Try this with a mirror. See the water droplets   form on the mirror.

The   changes from a solid to a liquid to a gas or from a gas to a liquid to a solid   are called a phase changes. When substances such as water change phase, its physical   properties change, but not its chemical properties. Melting, freezing, condensation,   and evaporation are examples of phase changes.The phase of a substance depends   on temperature and pressure.
