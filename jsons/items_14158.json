With a focus on both the business and content aspects of the industry, the program offers students a range of courses with practical and real-life application. Courses deal with the marketing, finance, management, accounting, legal, and economic issues facing entertainment and media firms. Industries covered include, film, home video, television, cable, music, sports, and publishing.        &#8211; Message from the Directors          EMT is a unique program that examines the business side of the entertainment industry. The program has formally been in existence for over 10 years and has grown from a few course offerings in marketing to a wide range of courses in marketing, finance, accounting, economics, law, and management at both the graduate and undergraduate level.    EMT has a broad focus on various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, home video, broadcast TV, cable networks, MSO\u2019s, DTH satellite, publishing (books, newspapers and magazines), sports, and music. Furthermore, the program looks broadly at the different business functions within the industry and how the digital revolution is dramatically challenging and changing existing business models. The MBA and B.S.B.A. curricula blend theory with practical applications. Courses are taught by regular Stern faculty as well as by adjunct professors from leading entertainment firms.    Students gain a broad understanding of the strategy and operating principles that drive the individual sectors of the entertainment industry. Classes are structured to encourage students to explore concepts, frameworks and models, and analyze industry data across multiple revenue streams. Students examine leading companies in the industry, such as Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Sony, CBS, Viacom, and Comcast/NBCU.    In a partnership with the Tisch School of the Arts Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, EMT established a dual MBA/MFA degree. This helps bridge the gap between the \u201ccreatives\u201d and the \u201csuits\" and puts NYU at the forefront of preparing the next generation of producers and studio executives.    EMT attracts truly exceptional students who have a passion for the entertainment industry. Organizations such as STEBA (Stern Tisch Entertainment Business Association) for undergraduates, and MESA (Media Entertainment and Sports Association) and TANG (Technology and New Media Group) for graduate students provide forums for networking and co-curricular activities. One such activity is the ProMotion Pictures Film Competition which brings together business and creative talent from MBAs at Stern and MFAs at Tisch to produce branded entertainment films for major companies. Past sponsors include Cisco, Volvo, Verizon, Unilever\u2019s Axe, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, I LOVE NY, and Vita Coco.    Our New York City location, combined with exceptional students, creates a vibrant and exciting learning environment. The faculty and I are committed to provide the very best educational experience to help launch students on challenging and rewarding careers in the entertainment industry.

With a focus on both the business and content aspects of the industry, the program offers students a range of courses with practical and real-life application. Courses deal with the marketing, finance, management, accounting, legal, and economic issues facing entertainment and media firms. Industries covered include, film, home video, television, cable, music, sports, and publishing.        &#8211; Message from the Directors          EMT is a unique program that examines the business side of the entertainment industry. The program has formally been in existence for over 10 years and has grown from a few course offerings in marketing to a wide range of courses in marketing, finance, accounting, economics, law, and management at both the graduate and undergraduate level.    EMT has a broad focus on various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, home video, broadcast TV, cable networks, MSO\u2019s, DTH satellite, publishing (books, newspapers and magazines), sports, and music. Furthermore, the program looks broadly at the different business functions within the industry and how the digital revolution is dramatically challenging and changing existing business models. The MBA and B.S.B.A. curricula blend theory with practical applications. Courses are taught by regular Stern faculty as well as by adjunct professors from leading entertainment firms.    Students gain a broad understanding of the strategy and operating principles that drive the individual sectors of the entertainment industry. Classes are structured to encourage students to explore concepts, frameworks and models, and analyze industry data across multiple revenue streams. Students examine leading companies in the industry, such as Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Sony, CBS, Viacom, and Comcast/NBCU.    In a partnership with the Tisch School of the Arts Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, EMT established a dual MBA/MFA degree. This helps bridge the gap between the \u201ccreatives\u201d and the \u201csuits\" and puts NYU at the forefront of preparing the next generation of producers and studio executives.    EMT attracts truly exceptional students who have a passion for the entertainment industry. Organizations such as STEBA (Stern Tisch Entertainment Business Association) for undergraduates, and MESA (Media Entertainment and Sports Association) and TANG (Technology and New Media Group) for graduate students provide forums for networking and co-curricular activities. One such activity is the ProMotion Pictures Film Competition which brings together business and creative talent from MBAs at Stern and MFAs at Tisch to produce branded entertainment films for major companies. Past sponsors include Cisco, Volvo, Verizon, Unilever\u2019s Axe, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, I LOVE NY, and Vita Coco.    Our New York City location, combined with exceptional students, creates a vibrant and exciting learning environment. The faculty and I are committed to provide the very best educational experience to help launch students on challenging and rewarding careers in the entertainment industry.

Adekola, Lara   Lara Adekola is a first year Master&rsquo;s student in the Media, Culture, and Communications program at NYU. She is originally from Minneapolis, MN and graduated from Macalester College in 2010 with a B.A. cum laude in American Studies and minor in Media Studies.    While attending Macalester, she conducted independent research as a Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellow and explored the visual representations of black women within hip &ndash;hop culture. She supplemented this research through her experience as a New Media intern for Asylum Records. Lara also studied abroad in Brazil at the Universidade Federal da Bahia and had the opportunity to investigate the country&rsquo;s racial identity politics through a global media perspective.    After graduating from Macalester she moved to New York City, and worked in the media, fashion, and beauty industries. She has maintained her passion for writing and media through blogging as a contributing writer for sites such as AOL Music. At NYU, Lara hopes to further explore the intersections of race, gender, and class in the media, primarily in television, magazines, and advertisements. More specifically, she would like to interrogate how women of color support one another and define their own ideas of beauty in spaces such as blogs, online forums, and vlogs. At large she is concerned with popular culture, global media consumption, representation, and the utilization of Internet social media as sites for resistance and agency.          Akers, Adam   Adam Akers completed his undergraduate degree from Arizona State University. There he received a business degree with an emphasis in communication. During his studies, he worked teaching private music lessons, and since graduation, Adam has founded a company in Arizona that brings after school music programs to youth in both public and private schools. He also taught kindergarten through sixth grade basic music at a charter school in Mesa, Arizona. He began his studies at NYU MCC summer of 2014. His interests include how music is a powerful tool that shapes culture. He has done some research on how music in media can shape culture. He also has interest in communication challenges found in multicultural corporations.          Al Tamimi, AlHanouf   AlHanouf was born and raised in Kuwait City, Kuwait. As a resident in the Middle East coming from a family of well-known public figures, she was exposed to various forms of media and censorship, which then influenced her to pursue a degree in communications and media. During the summer of 2014, she graduated with a B.A. in Mass Communication and Media and a minor in Social and Behavioral Sciences with a concentration in Anthropology, as she wanted to focus on media and its influence on different cultures and societies worldwide. While at the American University in Kuwait, she had various opportunities whereby she immersed herself into the world of mass communications and media from working at a popular local brand and handling their public relations, social media, and online website to handling the stay of Steve Wozniak when he was in Kuwait to talk to young entrepreneurs. Opportunities as such helped prepare her mentally to what she will be expecting in the future in terms of her career. It also opened her eyes to the role of media within society, the rapid growth of social media, how technology affects media, and how media can alter the minds of many when it comes to politics and social movements.    AlHanouf plans to pursue her MA in MCC with an interest in human rights, citizenship, political communication and media and the idea of cross-cultural communication worldwide. This will ultimately allow her to create cross-cultural and political awareness in her society, and allow for an open door to new possibilities and ways of thinking in relation to communications and media back home. She plans to pursue a number of classes to further her knowledge in the field of Media, Culture and Communication. AlHanouf plans to follow an academic career path with a PhD program in the future.          Al-Mohannadi, Hessa   Hessa graduated from Georgetown University in 2010 with bachelors in Political Science and a certificate in American Politics. During her studies in Georgetown University, she has enrolled in courses in Media and Foreign Policy which has sparked her interest in media in relation to foreign policy, public opinion and journalism.    Hessa wishes to research how media tools can be used effectively in Middle Eastern cultures. She would like to further study and reflect on the relationship between new media and politics in the Middle Eastern context, especially in light of recent political developments in the region. She is very excited to be joining the MA in Media, Culture and Communication at New York University and hope to both add to and gain from this program. She is interested to pursue a PhD degree in media after she graduates from NYU.          Bedassie, Shantae   Shantae Bedassie graduated from Rutgers with a B.A. in Journalism and Media Studies and a double minor in social justice and philosophy. During her time at Rutgers she excelled academically and was a McNair and Paul Robeson Scholar. Her senior honors thesis focused on Analyzing the Media and its Role in the Socialization of the Female Gender through Commercialization. In her thesis, she argued that we are living in a socially constructed society. Everyone goes through the process of socialization. From a young age we are taught socially appropriate gender roles. We are conditioned through this process by being rewarded when we perform our role correctly and being reprimanded when we do not.    Shantae&rsquo;s thesis reviewed scholarship on gender socialization and examined the mainstream media in an effort to shed light on the influence it has on creating and reinforcing female gender roles. Original research in her thesis included a critical analysis of contemporary mainstream songs, magazine ads, and TV shows, to show how they contribute to the socialization of females. By including data from her interviews with female university students, her research also showed how viewing these media forms affects young women.    During her time at NYU Shantae plans to further her research. She is interested in exploring whether and how deviating from socially constructed gender norms can classify someone as a social outcast. Shantae plans on examining exactly what happens when a woman does not conform to socially acceptable gender roles. She believes that stories of LGBT youth being murdered due to their non- conformity are interesting and could be correlated to the way in which the media portrays what a socially acceptable woman should be.    We live in a society that sets strict rules and reinforces norms that are designed to place us into boxes and keep us marginalized. However, we as consumers have the ability and the power to control the messages that are being forced upon us. The way to do this is to critically analyze the media and to engage with the information that is put before us because we have more power than we think. She wants her readers to understand that we do not have to be passive subjects who simply absorb the media and that we can question social norms.          Bhattad, Sahil   Born and raised in India, Sahil Bhattad earned his B.A. in Economics with Political Science and Psychology as minor subjects from Symbiosis College of Arts and Commerce. Alongside the bachelor&rsquo;s program, he pursued a diploma in Liberal Arts from Symbiosis Centre for Liberal Arts and French Language from Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise de Poona.    At NYU, Sahil aims to explore unique ways of civic engagement. His research seeks to answer the following questions: How can various art forms (performing and fine) be used to engage in the socio-political processes? How can activism benefit from the use of art? What is the role of media in affecting the public consciousness and their decision making process? How does social and political propaganda affect, create, and annihilate a culture to suit its needs?    Previously, Sahil carried out research on the politics of Indian classical music in the twentieth century and is deeply invested in furthering it at NYU. A die hard foodie, he is passionate about music, movies, reading and traveling.          Cheng, Matthew   Matthew graduated from the University of Maryland &ndash; Baltimore County with a B.A. in General Psychology and a B.A. in Media &amp; Communication. After graduating, he took a year to volunteer and joined AmeriCorps, serving as a volunteer coordinator at Our Daily Bread Soup Kitchen in Baltimore. Now that his year is up, he has decided to go back to school and pursue his M.A. at NYU. He is currently interested in continuing his research on the evolution of amateur pornography, focusing on sexual experimentation through different mediums.          Drummond, Lucy   Lucy Drummond was born and raised in Manhattan. She is a triple varsity alumnus of Deerfield Academy, and studied Mandarin Chinese at Claremont McKenna College. After taking a year off of college and backpacking in China, she transferred to NYU Gallatin. Lucy graduated as an Honors Scholar in 2013, and also played on NYU&rsquo;s Varsity Volleyball team.    Lucy&rsquo;s interests and pursuits span many areas. In addition to athletics and Chinese, she is passionate about contemporary art and literature. She has worked for Paddle8 and PULSE Contemporary Art Fair, and currently works under Gallatin Professor Emeritus Laurin Raiken as a Research Associate for the Raiken Arts Archive. Lucy reads about a book a week, and is always looking to swap books with other bibliophiles.    Designated as an &ldquo;early adopter of social media&rdquo; in 2010 by the women&rsquo;s organization 85 Broads, Lucy taught anchors on major television networks how to use Twitter, built websites, and most recently attended the ITP Camp.    Lucy is thrilled to continue to her studies at NYU, embark upon new projects, and meet motivated, intellectual students in the ever evolving MCC field.          Edel, Victoria   Victoria Edel is a first year student in MCC's Master's program from Brooklyn, New York. She graduated from Georgetown University in 2014 with a B.A. in History and Government. At Georgetown, she worked for The Hoya, the school's newspaper of record, covering pop culture and movies and serving as managing editor.    Victoria is particularly interested in narratives of good and evil in a post-9/11, post-modern world, particularly in the context of the superhero, sci-fi, and fantasy genres.    She has previously worked at the American Bar Association and the Women's Media Center, where she looked at the effects of sexist media coverage on female politicians.          Edelstein, Alex   Alex&rsquo;s research uses hip hop as a case study for investigating ways in which we can redefine the construction and articulation of categories of identity, focusing on non-normative representations of gender and sexuality. Through performative acts including dance, drug use, and intentional speech acts, individuals are able to transgress the rigidity of normative definitions of identity. Alex hopes to expand upon this phenomenon, explaining it as possible in every context, such that inherently fluid, performative acts can replace the traditionally divisive categories of identity in defining individuals.    In addition to pursuing his M.A., Alex is the Director of the Copywriting and Social Media departments at a creative advertising agency based in New York, where he incorporates theories of identity formation into the process of constructing global, multichannel advertising campaigns. Previously, Alex has conducted ethnographic research at Columbia University on a project titled &ldquo;Artist Identity Expressed Through Rap Lyrics,&rdquo; and has published extensively on hip hop, linguistics, and identity construction. He graduated cum laude with a B.A. in Hip Hop, Culture, and Identity Formation form the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University.          Elgarresta, Adriana   Adriana was born in Caracas, Venezuela but grew up in Miami, Florida. At a young age, she was exposed to various different cultures, which influenced her interest in cross-cultural communications. In 2012, she graduated from The George Washington University with a B.A. in political science and a minor in history. While studying political science, she was primarily interested in the study of culture policy. During her time at The George Washington University, Adriana also had the opportunity to do a semester abroad in Paris. While abroad, she traveled to many cities across Europe such as Venice, Berlin, Madrid, Prague, Budapest and Zurich. These travel experiences further opened her eyes to the important role visual culture and cross-cultural communication play in shaping and developing contemporary society. She interned in the communications department at Brookings Institute and spent the last year working for Art Basel Miami Beach. Adriana&rsquo;s goal as an incoming MCC MA student is to learn about new and effective ways of using old and new media technologies, specifically in the area of visual culture, to help bridge cultural differences, create cross-cultural awareness, and encourage creative expression and innovation.           Flores, Patricia Renee   Originally from Riverside, California, Patricia graduated with a double BA in Art History (with Distinction in the Major) and Art Studio from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1994. Her research interests led her to earn a MA from The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design and Material Culture in New York in 2007. She has worked and taught for such institutions as The Metropolitan Museum of Art, California College of the Arts (Oakland and San Francisco), Diablo Valley College, CA, The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, CA, and The Asian Art Museum, San Francisco.    Patricia&rsquo;s presence in NYU&rsquo;s Media, Culture and Communication program marks a distinct shift in research interests. A 9/11 survivor, Patricia is losing her hearing, which is impacting every part of her life. Patricia&rsquo;s research interests now intersect the hard-of-hearing/deaf communities, disability issues, technology, the media, and public health. She is equally fascinated by the themes of terrorism, PTSD, memorials, and memory.          Fritschner, Kristine   Kristine attended the University of San Diego, graduating in 2011 with a degree in communication studies. Afterwards, she spent time abroad with her family in Europe and in Hong Kong as a teaching assistant. Upon her return Kristine pursued opportunities at The Walt Disney Company, working with the Cable Networks Group Domestic Mastering team and, later, ABC Digital Sales. As a first year MCC Master&rsquo;s student, Kristine&rsquo;s research interests include the representation of gender, sexuality and relationships in mass media, and how the visual arts can be used to transform negative images and stereotypes. After earning her MA, she hopes to continue her studies at a PhD program.          Gilberg, Daniel   Danny graduated Vassar College in 2010 with a degree in history. After graduating, he spent a year as an AmeriCorps member at City Year, Washington DC. There, he worked as a reading and math tutor for two different first grade classrooms, and also organized after school activities. Since starting the MCC program, Danny has interned at various organizations in New York, including CBS News and the Clinton Foundation.    Danny&rsquo;s coursework and research focuses primarily on the intersection of pop culture and American politics.

Josh wishes to investigate the concept of public manipulation and its emerging relationship with social media and corporate communications. It is clear that the technology of our age allows information to spread over distances and across cultures like never before. But will we find an ideological common ground as all peoples are exposed to all ideas? Or, will we become more Balkanized as we immerse ourselves in the culture, politics, and scientific interpretations of our preferred realities? In either case, what are the styles and methodologies of communication that will remain effective, rising above the noise and breaching the walls? Are there any sophisticated universal concepts left, or will the ammunition of tomorrow's messaging wars be LOL Cats? If so, which ones? He is also interested in \"greenwashing,\" human rights violations, the rising gap between rich and poor, and similar such things that go bump in the night.

Pactua, Emmanuelle   Born and raised in Monaco, Emmanuelle graduated from City University London in 2013 with a BA in Journalism and Sociology. This educational background has trained her in how to craft news stories: from the early glimmers of an idea, into the development of a story and to its final presentation across multiple platforms. In addition, her semester at the Paris Institute of Political Science (Sciences Po) greatly sharpened her analytical skills. Now Emmanuelle is eager to learn what happens next. As platforms like Twitter and Facebook democratize the news-scape, allowing nearly anyone to become an amateur journalist or activist, what consequences and benefits will there be? Will our increasing interconnectivity improve the quality of human relationships? Does the relative ease of spreading the news diminish the impact and longevity of each individual story? Emmanuelle is eager to approach these emerging questions through critical thinking and multiple lenses, such as psychological, sociological, and geopolitical factors. As someone who has grown up in Europe, geopolitical analysis is of particular interest to her. Emmanuelle is fascinated by the varied ways in which different cultures assimilate and disseminate media. Furthermore, the MCC program aligns with Emmanuelle&rsquo;s many interests, especially her goal of harnessing the power of the media for charitable causes both locally and internationally. Last year she created an athletic fundraiser whereby people could support her Mount Kilimanjaro climb by donating to &lsquo;Casa Hogar&rsquo;, a children&rsquo;s home in Oaxaca, Mexico. In a little more than two weeks, her project raised over $16,500 by using platforms like Facebook, YouTube and Global Giving. More broadly, Emmanuelle is enthusiastic to learn how to heighten understanding of social inequities. This year she completed a Policy &amp; Communications internship at (RED), a New York-based organization that is fighting and raising awareness about AIDS/HIV in Africa through carefully selected brand placements and celebrity endorsements. Emmanuelle realizes how important it is to possess a thorough understanding of digital literacy, consumer culture and global sensitivity in order to set in motion wide-scale campaigns that inspire others to act. Distinguishing MCC courses and projects make her confident that her curriculum will not only surround her with fellow students passionate about activism, but will also render her fully prepared to work effectively in socially conscious organizations.

Ramsawak, Sara-Lee   After receiving her B.A. from the Johns Hopkins University with a major in International Studies and a minor in Africana Studies in 2012, Sara-Lee Ramsawak has become intrigued by the influence of local cultures on national policies, laws, and mentalities as well as the diverse affects globalization has on these nations. Through the MCC MA program, she wishes to expand her cultural intellect by studying concepts like these through the Global and Transcultural area of study.    Coming from a multicultural background and having the opportunity to visit many different nations through personal, academic, service, and business travel, Sara has witnessed the benefits one attains when they participate in international experiences. When she looks back on the past few years of her life, the trips she has taken and how much she has learned from them leaves the biggest impression. They have expanded her intellect and allow her to think about things with a different perspective.

Saenz, Herrero   Born and raised in Madrid, I graduated from Complutense University with a Licenciatura in Sociology in 2013. After graduating, I worked as a research assistant for the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), were I had interned in 2011.    While completing my degree I had the opportunity to explore diverse dimensions of cultural analysis, such as the creation of different collective imaginaries, the effect those imaginaries have on people&rsquo;s experiences, the influence that communication and information technologies have on social phenomena, or the reproduction of culture in everyday life. These first approaches have nourished my interest towards the theoretical aspects of Communication and Cultural Studies.    In addition, my research interests also include the study of the social and cultural dimension of mental health and illness, specifically depression, self-harm and suicidal behavior. One of my academic goals is to apply the tools that Cultural Studies have to offer to gain some understanding on how do we socially address those issues.          Sanford, Alex   Alex's childhood was spent in several rural and small town communities across the western United States. She attended the University of Kansas as a third generation Jayhawk, after her father and grandfather before her, graduating with dual majors in Geography, with a focus in the psychology of place and cultural mapping, and Humanities &amp; Western Civilization. After graduation she boarded a Greyhound bus and headed west, spending the next 8 years in urban settings.

Xia, Yuanjie   Growing up in Zhoushan, an island of China, Yuanjie is fond of meeting different people, and possesses adventurous spirits of exploration the outside world.    Since childhood, she has travelled across almost two thirds of China, and visited six countries. However, the farther places she reached, she found the stronger stereotypes about her country in the eyes of the locals. Especially in Hong Kong, a region with multi-party system, capitalist economy while under the sovereign of mainland China, most people consider Mainland Chinese as brainwashed and backward, even though they share the common culture. Such experience intrigued her to think of the hurdles making the transcultural communication difficulty.    After several internships in Chinese party-owned media, the major channel to present China to the world, and a half-year exchange experience in Hong Kong Baptist University, a good opportunity to witness the image of China in the outsiders&rsquo; eyes, Yuanjie discovered that the main obstacles lie in the distorted information, which are always caused by government intervention, media environment, cultural differences and so on. In the digital media era, the incorrect information are more easily spread through media, particularly social networks.    Since she became a journalism student, Yuanjie has formed the belief that the basic element of successful communication is the unfettered truth, and decided to pursue the truth. Yuanjie&rsquo;s current aim is to gain the knowledge and sharing of views with faculty and colleagues at NYU, which will enhance her to someday help create a public online platform where global communication is equal and free.
