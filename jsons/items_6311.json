At its heart, the class aims to pose difficult and productive questions that will help you understand your tendencies and priorities as an artist, the methods you employ, and where these are in the service of the work as opposed to where they stand in the way. The class requires rigorous and individualized research into your sources of artistic influence with an emphasis on analytical thinking about the methods and strategies employed by those artists or thinkers you consider key influences. The course includes assignments that explore your existing strategies and subject matter in order to understand what has motivated and generated the work thus far. Other assignments push students to work against the grain of their usual modes in order to discover new ways of working and to undermine default strategies. Towards the end of the term, the accumulated insights will be channeled into writing about your work that will be useful in the future context of an artist\u2019s statement or artistic aims essay. In the personal and lab-like atmosphere that this course hopes to cultivate, the class also aims to connect Gallatin graduate students to each other\u2019s work and practice, and to take advantage of the enormous importance that peer input and critique can have on work in progress. Possible side effects include: focused engagement, enhanced motivation, collaboration.

The course includes assignments that explore your existing strategies and subject matter in order to understand what has motivated and generated the work thus far. Other assignments push students to work against the grain of their usual modes in order to discover new ways of working and to undermine default strategies. Towards the end of the term, the accumulated insights will be channeled into writing about your work that will be useful in the future context of an artist\u2019s statement or artistic aims essay. In the personal and lab-like atmosphere that this course hopes to cultivate, the class also aims to connect Gallatin graduate students to each other\u2019s work and practice, and to take advantage of the enormous importance that peer input and critique can have on work in progress. Possible side effects include: focused engagement, enhanced motivation, collaboration.

Description       This course is intended for Gallatin graduate students with a production component to their creative practice. At its heart, the class aims to pose difficult and productive questions that will help you understand your tendencies and priorities as an artist, the methods you employ, and where these are in the service of the work as opposed to where they stand in the way. The course starts with a series of exercises and assignments that explore the strategies and subject matter of each student in order to understand what has motivated and generated the work you have made thus far. The next set of assignments encourage you to work against the grain of the familiar to discover other solutions than the ones that might immediately appear to be the best ones. Towards the end of the terms, these various insights will be channeled into writing about your work that will be useful in the future context of an artist\u2019s statement or project proposal essay. In the personal and lab-like atmosphere that this course hopes to cultivate, the class aims to connect Gallatin graduate students to each other\u2019s work and practice, and to take advantage of the enormous importance that peer input can have on work in progress. Possible side effects include: getting unstuck, reengagement, enhanced motivation, collaboration.
