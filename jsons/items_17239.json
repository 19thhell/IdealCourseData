Admission Requirements   Admission to this program requires an MS in Transportation Planning and Engineering or equivalent, with a GPA of 3.5 or better (on a 0-4 scale). GRE scores are required for all full-time PhD applicants. Should you decide to take the tests, you must submit the results for consideration. Foreign applicants must take the TOEFL examination and submit the results for consideration.   The &ldquo;equivalent&rdquo; of the MS degree can be achieved in several ways. For instance, you may have an MS degree with a different title that covers substantially the same material. More generally, you must demonstrate that you have the equivalent of all undergraduate and master&rsquo;s level course work in order to pursue doctoral level work in the major area. Further, &ldquo;equivalence&rdquo; is evaluated based on the totality of your undergraduate and graduate record, not course-by-course.   Because admission to this program requires a related MS (or equivalent), those of you who have not yet achieved a master&rsquo;s degree would normally be admitted as MS students. You are expected to earn an MS degree while completing your major and minor course requirements. In rare cases, an applicant with only a BS degree may be directly admitted into the PhD program with the written approval of the department head.   Transfer Credits   Transfer credits for PhD students can be awarded course by course. Alternatively, a MS degree from another institution may be accepted for transfer in toto . In the former case, a maximum of 42 credits of approved graduate work may be transferred. The latter requires a recommendation from the department&rsquo;s Graduate Committee and the approval of the department head. Transfer credits are awarded generally at the time of admission and must be approved by the academic adviser, the transportation graduate coordinator and the department head.

Engineering Category:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Transportation Planning, Civil, Traffic     Engineering Connection:\u00a0 Transportation and infrastructure are two of the most important components of a city. Traffic engineering and transportation engineering are two important fields in designing an effective system in a smart city.     Pre-Requisite Knowledge: None     Learning Objectives:   After this lesson, students will be able to:     Know design criteria that traffic engineers have to account for.   Understand the principles of transportation planning including trip generation, trip distribution, modal split, and trip assignment.   Understand the importance of transportation engineer in a world with a growing population.         Traffic Engineering   Traffic engineering is the discipline of engineering focused on roadways. The greatest consideration of traffic engineers is safety, but traffic engineers also try to design traffic facilities that function economically, efficiently, and rapidly for effective movement of people and goods.     Safety is of paramount importance in traffic engineering. Multiple factors can affect a car\u2019s ability to stop safely, such as the speed of vehicle, the time it takes for the driver to react, the friction of the road, and the grade of the road.  One design criteria used by traffic engineers is safe stopping distance. Introduce the safe stopping distance equation:       Speed = speed of vehicle in miles per hour   Reaction Time = 2.5 seconds (AASHTO standard time of reaction)   Friction Factor = 0.348 (Standard friction factor)   Grade = Slope of the road. (Uphill is positive, downhill is negative)     Have students solve an example problem, calculating the stopping distance in a highway scenario. Given:     Speed = 60 mph   Time of Reaction = 2.5 seconds   Friction Factor = 0.35   Grade = 0 (Flat Road)     What is the thinking distance? (Answer: 220.5 ft) What is the braking distance? (Answer: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 343 ft) What is the total stopping distance? (Answer: 563.5 ft)     Level of service is another design aspect of traffic engineers. Level of service describes the quality of the roadway or traffic conditions. Level of service, or LOS, is graded from A to F, describing the flow of traffic and how safe the roadway is. The Brooklyn Queens Expressway is one of the worst highways in the country &#8212; the level of service of the BQE is always either a LOS E or LOS F. LOS C is the most economical level of service that causes minimal delay of traffic, while using the most of the space and lanes provided.     Transportation Planning   Transportation planning is the design of transport infrastructure such as roads and public transportation lines. To create an effective transportation model, engineers must predict how residents travel throughout the city. There are four steps in transportation planning: trip generation (how many trips are taken), trip distribution (where people are traveling to and from), modal split (the mode of transportation used), and trip assignment (which streets or routes are used).       Procedure     Planning Your City Activity     As a class, students play the role of transportation engineers, and brainstorm their city\u2019s transportation system.     Have students discuss their city with respect to the four steps of transportation planning. They should start by determining their city\u2019s population size, and the number of private vehicles. Ask students to consider what modal split they would like their city to have, and what they will do as transportation engineers to encourage the balance of transportation modes they have decided on.

Given:     Speed = 60 mph   Time of Reaction = 2.5 seconds   Friction Factor = 0.35   Grade = 0 (Flat Road)     What is the thinking distance? (Answer: 220.5 ft) What is the braking distance? (Answer: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 343 ft) What is the total stopping distance? (Answer: 563.5 ft)     Level of service is another design aspect of traffic engineers. Level of service describes the quality of the roadway or traffic conditions. Level of service, or LOS, is graded from A to F, describing the flow of traffic and how safe the roadway is. The Brooklyn Queens Expressway is one of the worst highways in the country &#8212; the level of service of the BQE is always either a LOS E or LOS F. LOS C is the most economical level of service that causes minimal delay of traffic, while using the most of the space and lanes provided.     Transportation Planning   Transportation planning is the design of transport infrastructure such as roads and public transportation lines. To create an effective transportation model, engineers must predict how residents travel throughout the city. There are four steps in transportation planning: trip generation (how many trips are taken), trip distribution (where people are traveling to and from), modal split (the mode of transportation used), and trip assignment (which streets or routes are used).       Procedure     Planning Your City Activity     As a class, students play the role of transportation engineers, and brainstorm their city\u2019s transportation system.     Have students discuss their city with respect to the four steps of transportation planning. They should start by determining their city\u2019s population size, and the number of private vehicles. Ask students to consider what modal split they would like their city to have, and what they will do as transportation engineers to encourage the balance of transportation modes they have decided on.

Accidents paralyze long stretches of freeway, rush hour congestion slows traffic to a crawl, and crowded intersections can become an obstacle course for pedestrians. Traffic engineers understand how highly functional roads and highways ease such frustrations. It&rsquo;s their job to properly design and manage our traffic systems, to act as the caretakers of our cities&rsquo; economic and social health.   The Certificate in Traffic Engineering program trains our students to become those caretakers. As one of the world&rsquo;s busiest and most populous regions, the New York City metro area provides a natural testing ground for the study of traffic systems. Our curriculum focuses on urban freeway and intercity networks, the management of arterial and street space, and the design and control of intersections. It also introduces you to the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its increasing importance in the field of traffic engineering.   Whether you&rsquo;re a working professional or a student seeking a highly focused, part-time course of study, our certificate provides specialized knowledge that you can apply immediately in the field. You&rsquo;ll also have the foundation to pursue further studies in the future: each of our courses can be transferred to an advanced degree program.   Admission Requirements   Applicants may be students with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees seeking to specialize in an aspect of transportation or those with advanced degrees wishing additional course work in a highly focused area of the profession.   You may apply for transfer to degree programs without any loss of credits, assuming you are admitted to the degree program and that the courses are related to the degree. Admission to this certificate program does not guarantee admission to a full degree program.                                    Program Manager        Elena S.
