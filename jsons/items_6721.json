We begin with performance proper, and then narrow our focus to discuss what elements of performance are incorporated into narrative text to produce \u201cperformative writing.\u201d Does minority positioning affect the content, structure, and manner in which these artists perform or write, and in turn, how they are received? How might sexual/gender politics nuance that positioning? Rather than seeking division under the rubric of \u201cnational literature,\u201d or the multicultural versions such as \u201cAfrican-American\u201d or \u201cAsian-American\u201d writers/artists, the course will look for structural and contextual models that cross these categories - concern with oral histories and family-community genealogies, for example. We will also analyze how specific power politics inform these artists\u2019 activities across their broadly diverse sociocultural, ethnic, and geopolitical contexts. Texts may include: fiction by William Faulkner, Nakagami Kenji, Ruth Ozeki and Toni Morrison, and theoretical selections from Jacques Derrida, Antonin Artaud, Judith Butler.

We begin with performance proper, and then narrow our focus to discuss what elements of performance are incorporated into narrative text to produce \u201cperformative writing.\u201d Does minority positioning affect the content, structure, and manner in which these artists perform or write, and in turn, how they are received? How might sexual/gender politics nuance that positioning? Rather than seeking division under the rubric of \u201cnational literature,\u201d or the multicultural versions such as \u201cAfrican-American\u201d or \u201cAsian-American\u201d writers/artists, the course will look for structural and contextual models that cross these categories - concern with oral histories and family-community genealogies, for example. We will also analyze how specific power politics inform these artists\u2019 activities across their broadly diverse sociocultural, ethnic, and geopolitical contexts. Texts may include: fiction by William Faulkner, Nakagami Kenji, Ruth Ozeki and Toni Morrison, and theoretical selections from Jacques Derrida, Antonin Artaud, Judith Butler.

This 2-unit course is taken after the student has completed a Proseminar and generally during the second semester of full-time study, or after completing 12 credits. This course is only offered in the Spring semester. Full-time students admitted in the spring term will need to take the Thesis Proposal Seminar in their third semester. Section 1 is for students who intend to complete a thesis drawing largely from research in the fields of the humanities. Please note that, throughout the semester, all sections of this course will occasionally meet together at the regular class time; this includes the first day of classes, Tuesday, January 28th, in which all sections meet at 1 Washington Place, Room 527.
