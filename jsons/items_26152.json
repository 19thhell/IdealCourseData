Students will have the opportunity to explore the city and to develop multimedia projects. The program features two complementary courses: Creative Computing and Live Video Performance Art. From fine art to computer programming, from live performance to animation, this workshop has applications across disciplines. There are no prerequisites, and the program welcomes students from all areas: e.g., film, music, computer science, dance, theater, fine art, multimedia, graphic design, performance art, photography etc.  Program Curriculum Students will enroll in the following two courses for a total of 8 units.   Live Video Performance Art IOART-UT 567.001 4 units Instructor: Max Nova This course will combine a history of video art and experimental film with practical training in the use of live video performance art technology. Students will explore new ways to create and edit films and videos using VJ software, projections, and multi-channel video surfaces. Workshops will demonstrate concepts and software that can be integrated into the creative process of video performance art and video art installations. Drawing inspiration from the recent history of video and multi-media artists, students will use live VJ software to manipulate digital media in real time as well as projection mapping techniques to project video art onto 3D surfaces in order to create original video art, video installations, and other performance pieces. Creative Computing IOART-UT 200.001 4 units Instructor: Shawn Van Every What can computation add to human communication and creativity? Creating applications, instead of just using them, gives a us deeper understanding of the possibilities. Creating projects that you are excited about and invested in, whether the domain of art, design, performance, humanities, sciences, or engineering is the best way to learn the skills needed to realize those ideas. This course will begin with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we experience our physical environment. The physical computing skills learned in this portion of the course will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard, and monitor interface to build your own, perhaps more expressive interfaces. The platform for the class is a micro-controller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere to both sense and create action in the physical world. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of programming as well as more advanced techniques such as animation, image manipulation and processing, projection mapping, and computer vision. The Java-based \u2018Processing\u2019 programming environment is the primary vehicle that will be in use. Processing itself is oriented towards displays but can also connect back to the physical sensors and controllers from the first part of the class in order to create more applications with more expressive interfaces. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered nature of it allows for more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.

and other mental health and arts-related fields to explore innovative social work and multidisciplinary responses to today\u2019s practice. By sharing perspectives across disciplines we will create a new climate for interprofessional understanding and collaboration.

Study Abroad Summer High School Summer in New York City Programs for Visiting Students Open Arts Minors Blog Events Newsletters Videos Admin &amp; Faculty Alumni Contact Us  home &gt; Special Programs        Multimedia Projects Workshop   Program Overview With a young, creative population and an energetic, cosmopolitan art scene, Berlin has been enjoying a unique artistic revival that celebrates multimedia projects and unconventional spaces. Students will have the opportunity to explore the city and to develop multimedia projects. The program features two complementary courses: Creative Computing and Live Video Performance Art. From fine art to computer programming, from live performance to animation, this workshop has applications across disciplines. There are no prerequisites, and the program welcomes students from all areas: e.g., film, music, computer science, dance, theater, fine art, multimedia, graphic design, performance art, photography etc.  Program Curriculum Students will enroll in the following two courses for a total of 8 units.   Live Video Performance Art IOART-UT 567.001 4 units Instructor: Max Nova This course will combine a history of video art and experimental film with practical training in the use of live video performance art technology. Students will explore new ways to create and edit films and videos using VJ software, projections, and multi-channel video surfaces. Workshops will demonstrate concepts and software that can be integrated into the creative process of video performance art and video art installations. Drawing inspiration from the recent history of video and multi-media artists, students will use live VJ software to manipulate digital media in real time as well as projection mapping techniques to project video art onto 3D surfaces in order to create original video art, video installations, and other performance pieces. Creative Computing IOART-UT 200.001 4 units Instructor: Shawn Van Every What can computation add to human communication and creativity? Creating applications, instead of just using them, gives a us deeper understanding of the possibilities. Creating projects that you are excited about and invested in, whether the domain of art, design, performance, humanities, sciences, or engineering is the best way to learn the skills needed to realize those ideas. This course will begin with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we experience our physical environment. The physical computing skills learned in this portion of the course will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard, and monitor interface to build your own, perhaps more expressive interfaces. The platform for the class is a micro-controller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere to both sense and create action in the physical world. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of programming as well as more advanced techniques such as animation, image manipulation and processing, projection mapping, and computer vision. The Java-based \u2018Processing\u2019 programming environment is the primary vehicle that will be in use. Processing itself is oriented towards displays but can also connect back to the physical sensors and controllers from the first part of the class in order to create more applications with more expressive interfaces. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project centered nature of it allows for more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and make lots of friends by helping the other students.

Robin Glazer , MS, BA, Director, The Creative Center, University Settlement       The Creative Center offers programs in visual, performing and literary arts for people living with cancer, other chronic illnesses and across the aging spectrum. As participants struggle through the challenges and turmoil of diagnosis, treatment and survivorship, having a space to engage in creative expression - where positive distraction with a caring individual can reduce stress, alleviate anxiety and fear, decrease boredom and reduce pain- has proven to be highly therapeutic in its own right. Robin Glazer, Director of The Creative Center at University Settlement (TCC) will discuss the program's unique approach. Participants from one of the programs will describe their experiences.          4:30 - 4:55 pm     Closing Remarks          4:55 - 5:00 pm     Evaluation Collection and Continuing Education Credit Dissemination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     REGISTRATION                                                                                                   This event has reached registration capacity.

Dr. Munson\u2019s latest publication in Social Science and Medicine titled, \u201c Static, dynamic, integrated and contextualized: A framework for understanding mental health service utilization among young adults\u201d provides a springboard for examining these questions, which emerged directly from face-to-face interviews with young adults who transitioned from adolescence to adulthood with mental health challenges.    Dr. Munson has published in Psychiatric Services, Social Science and Medicine, Administration and Policy in Mental Health and Mental Health Services Research, Children and Youth Services Review, and the Journal of Behavioral Health Services and Research, among others.    Dr. Munson\u2019s research has been supported through funding mechanisms at the federal, state, and local levels.

Today artists working in the field of social practice focus on aesthetics, ethics, collaboration, media strategies, & social activism as central issues that inform their artworks & projects that are designed for public & social spaces. In the United States, visual art that engaged the public directly began in the late 1950s & coincided with the local \u201cdecentralization\u201d efforts that, in the arts, resulted in community-based art practices that envisioned the public as diverse, socially-engaged, & contributed to an expansive aesthetic consciousness. Understanding this history contextualizes social practice art & allows us to interrogate the ways artists blur the lines between object making, performance, activism, grass roots organizing & pedagogy.

Imagination is assumed to be the primary resource for artists, one that is best used by rejecting constraints through an attitude of limitlessness & radical personal freedom. It is celebrated for its ability to enable people to \u2018think outside the box,\u2019 to innovate & to surprise. Anarchy, as a social & political idea, receives a far more ambivalent welcome. From it\u2019s linguistic roots meaning \u2019without a rule,\u2019 it would seem to be a fellow traveler to the imagination, seeking to scale up the trans-formative potential of the imagination to a social & political scale. But if it is a change in scale, it is one that then challenges use to examine closely the implications of the imagination & to engage with the full complexity of anarchy. The course will explore these ideas through a range of texts by authors such as Andre Breton, Leo Tolstoy, Jean-Paul Sartre, Emma Goldman. Murray Rothbard, Murray Bookchin, David Graeber, & Hakim Bey. Finally, we will consider the questions of lawlessness, violence & insurrection by looking at the writings of Valerie Solanas, the Unibomber, Tiqqun & the Anonomous Collective.

The class will look at the content of artwork, including ideas in contemporary & traditional arts, both Chinese & international, & build various skills to translate ideas into reality. With the medium of Ink, students will use their living experience in Shanghai to integrate & create artwork, with the influences of art that they have been exposed to, personal influences they have experiences, &/or the societal landscape that they see around them. Students will work on individual projects using ink to create paintings, sculpture, or multimedia art. Class time will be devoted to individual & group critiques, lectures, class discussions, & visits to local artists, galleries, & museums. A journal will be kept to record ideas, sketches, references & future plans. By the close of the semester, each students will have a complete body of artwork & participate in an exhibition.

The goal of the course is to help the student sharpen his/her point-of-view and to develop constructive motivational tools. To aid in the process we will address the conflict between such binaries as: art and craft, art and ideas and the social and physical space of art. Our method will include individual studio meetings, group critiques, presentations and exhibitions of art. Readings and exhibitions will be assigned according to students\u2019 particular research needs. They may include; Philip Fisher, \"Making and Effacing Art\"; Craig Owens, \"Beyond Recognition: Representation, Power and Culture\u201d and James Hillman, \"The Dream and the Underworld\", as well as student suggested readings.

To that end the class will study the relevant writings of Michael Foucault, Roland Barthes and Walter Benjamin while students create a body of work over the semester. Films and artists to be viewed will include Todd Haynes, Jean Luc Godard, Nicki Lee, Vito Acconci and Federico Fellini. In this class, the presentation and discussion of readings, films, and visual art will alternate with individual studio visits and group critiques of student work. Critiques of student projects will consider the philosophical and cultural implications of artistic activity. Students will work in an interdisciplinary manner, using media of their own choosing to explore their forms and ideas within the context of the course's readings and class discussions. Student will also spend time presenting their work and that of other artists to help them develop a vocabulary for discussing and understanding their production as they move towards their thesis project. The course objective is to empower students by expanding their perspectives and skills in artmaking, discussion and critique.

Still in it's infancy - the first film was made in 1895 - it is a form that has quickly evolved from the desire to capture motion, generating almost as many uses & traditions both conceptual & material as there are makers. Through screenings, readings, lectures & discussions this course investigates the ways in which certain artists have used film and video to explore meaning, experiment with form, & reshape the way we see.

What impact can we have in our communities that supports critical dialogues within & between a broad range of political, economic, & social contexts? In this class we will explore this & other questions first through a series of exercises in the studio & then later with community partners.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.

Color as a phenomenon is one of the most powerful tools in the artist\u2019s repertoire. It\u2019s relation to perception lies at the heart of our notions of the objective & the subjective. Color will be explored in depth through a series of open-ended projects & a series of short experiment/ assignments.

The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               60    3            ART-GE 2974            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Exhibition Making           A studio course that combines multidisciplinary creative practices & scholarship through the framework of curating & exhibition making. Students will gain hands on experience through the mentorship of guest artists & curators who are presenting exhibitions, in conjunction with the course, at the Art Department\u2019s 80WSE Gallery. Additionally, students will collaborate with these guests on all aspects of production for their projects, including exhibition design, historical research, assembling an exhibition catalogue, borrowing art works from museums & private collections. The activities covered move beyond studio practice, offering primary information & unique insight into the many concerns that comprise any public presentation of artwork.

The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure will at once expose students to the ideas of limits & how the limit or horizon of the possible can be elaborated & expanded on in art. Students will engage in-group & one-on-one discussion of projects made in response to readings & assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration & consistency in a creative practice.      Course Page               45    3            ART-GE 2982            Interdisciplinary Graduate Projects in Studio Art: Visionaries and Saboteurs           This interdisciplinary course focuses on how artists engage with ?institutions? in contemporary culture. These many ?institutions?: fashion, the museum, the store, the government, the home, & music among them, are all structures, which make up the world in which we live.

What impact can we have in our communities that supports critical dialogues within & between a broad range of political, economic, & social contexts? In this class we will explore this & other questions first through a series of exercises in the studio & then later with community partners.

Color as a phenomenon is one of the most powerful tools in the artist\u2019s repertoire. It\u2019s relation to perception lies at the heart of our notions of the objective & the subjective. Color will be explored in depth through a series of open-ended projects & a series of short experiment/ assignments.

From the most ancient of civilizations to the present moment, mural works attach themselves to architecture & become statements about the function & social implications of the architectural site. This social implication, long recognized by the patrons, governments & institutions that allow them, has been of vital importance to understandings of the idea of the artist as an individual.

They should be largely self-directed & self-motivated, as there are no sophisticated research or action tools thus far available for much of the course material. Creativity will play a large role, especially when examining creative resistance actions that took place with minimal or no documentation, which is the case for most of them. Course goals are to build useful databases & acquaint students with the depth & breadth of activist practice.      Course Page               45    3            ART-UE 1983            Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Environmental Art Activism           Contemporary environmentalism is an issue dominated by scientific, technical & policy discourse. The terms of this political environmental discussion begs the questions; what role does & can art practice play in the contemporary environmental movement? What have artists contributed to contemporary urban environmentalism? To explore these questions we will use the local urban street as our site of ecological analysis, intervention & exhibition. Building on a history of ephemeral political actions of the ?Reclaim the Streets? & other political movements the focus will be on durable or sustainable interventions in urban ecosystems involving both human institutions & infrastructure, & the work of other non human organisms. Students will work on projects that re-imagine our relationship to natural systems      Course Page               45    3            ART-UE 1981            Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Projects in Studio Art: Sex and Contemporary Art           This interdisciplinary class combines studio practice & critique with slide lectures, readings, audiovisual material & visits to relevant exhibitions. The course presents an introduction to the relationship between sexual liberation movements & contemporary visual culture, with a particular focus on developments in the last thirty-five years from Womanhouse to ?post-feminism?: from bra-burning to backlash, from bad girls to victims, from gay pride to queer theory, & from theory to praxis. Special attention is given to the relationship between historical feminist work & its influence & derivation in contemporary art practice today. The articulation of the ?female subject?, & LGBT issues in art practice will also be addressed.

How the mind constructs pictures from visual data is an extremely complicated set of behaviors that are biological, psychological, social & cultural. Students will be given in-depth exposure to the conditions that are necessary for pictures to 'read' & how these conditions have a profound effect on the way people engage with art. This exposure will at once expose students to the ideas of limits & how the limit or horizon of the possible can be elaborated & expanded on in art. Students will engage in-group & one-on-one discussion of projects made in response to readings & assignments whose goal is to foster ideas of exploration & consistency in a creative practice.
