The Law and Society minor offers undergraduates a useful and meaningful cluster of courses in this area. Administered through the Department of Sociology, the minor is interdisciplinary in nature. It consists of five courses: one required \u201ccore\u201d course (Law and Society) and four electives. The electives can be taken from a list of approved courses across a range of disciplines. This allows the minor to be both substantial and coherent in its focus. The minor also provides students the opportunity to pursue advanced and specialized work through independent study projects as well as access to graduate classes (with permission of faculty). While prelaw students are welcome to take these classes, the minor is not aimed specifically at them. A list of courses that count toward the Law and Society minor is available every semester through the Sociology Department. Contact Jamie Lloyd ( jamie.lloyd@nyu.edu ) or Professor Lynne Haney ( lynne.haney@nyu.edu ) for a copy of this list or with questions about the minor. To declare a Law &amp; Society minor complete the Declaration of Minor Form .This   form should be mailed or dropped off to Jamie Lloyd at the NYU Department of   Sociology, Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street, room 4168.

The proposal will be reviewed by the program Director for approval.

Is Law for You?     As an undergraduate,   there are several ways to explore   the option of law school, both academically and through practical   experience.       Law-Oriented   Courses: As an undergraduate, you may   want to enroll in one or two law-oriented courses to test your   interest in   the study of law. Some may use as texts the same casebooks used by law   schools, but most will be taught in traditional undergraduate format.   Therefore, they do not necessarily prepare you for law school, and law   schools do not require them or similar courses. Several   courses in the College offer exposure to the law. They change   from year to year and semester to semester, so be certain to consult   the departments' websites as well as the fall and spring course schedules to familiarize   yourself   with the most current offerings. Law and Society Minor: This minor provides prelaw students with a   more integrated approach to the law and legal issues as examined   through the prism of the social sciences.  Again, these courses do not necessarily prepare you for law school, and law   schools do not require them or similar courses. It is a five-course minor that draws primarily on the CAS Departments of   Politics and Sociology. Note that courses used for this  minor may NOT be double-counted towards your major or other minor. For more   information, click here . NYU School of Law: If you want to   know what a law school course is like, you may sit in on one at our law   school. NYU   School of Law allows NYU undergraduates to visit any of the first-year   lectures. Contact the admissions office at (212) 998-6060 or stop by   110 West   3rd Street, 2nd Floor to arrange a visit. Internships: Obtaining \"hands-on\" experience through an internship in the legal field is an   excellent   way to determine if a career in law is right for you. It will also make you a   more   competitive candidate for law school admissions. Undergraduates have   served as   interns in the Courts, government agencies, non-profit organizations, legal public interest   agencies,   and law firms. NYU\u2019s Wasserman Center for Career Development    lists internships (paid, non-paid, and for-credit) on NYU   CareerNet. Internships are updated weekly with current positions for   the   fall, spring, and summer terms. To schedule an appointment with a career   counselor,   call the Wasserman Center at (212) 998-4730. Alumni Mentor Network: To learn   first-hand about a wide variety of legal areas, register for the   mentoring   program. This program, administered by the Wasserman Center for Career Development , allows   students to   benefit from the professional experiences of College alumni who are   practicing attorneys. The program offers informational interviews,   job-shadowing,   contacts, and networking opportunities. Students need to meet with a   career   counselor at the Wasserman Center in order to request a mentor. For   more   information, call (212) 998-4730 or visit their website.  Speaking of mentoring, we encourage you to learn more about Lawyer Alumni Mentoring Program (LAMP) for CAS undergraduates. Career Exploration: To   see if   \"law\" generally fits your interests, skills, career goals, and   educational path, speak with a career counselor at the Wasserman Center for Career Development . They can help you with descriptions of and other desired   information about many occupations, as well as providing information   on law   schools. Another crosscheck for your interest   in law may   be to test your tolerance for ambiguity. To the layman, law appears to   be an   extremely precise field. Something is clearly right or wrong, legal or   illegal. Yet any law student or lawyer can tell you that law is full   of   \"ifs,\" \"buts,\" and \"maybes.\" It is not a world   of black and white, but instead murky shadows and shades of gray.   Interpretation,   analysis, and even competence in the courtroom may depend upon your   ability   to stay afloat in an ocean of ambiguity. If you are the type who likes   precision and exactness, then you might think twice about a career in   law.    For students motivated by idealistic   or   humanitarian interests, the long hours and hard work devoted to   learning   legal fundamentals may seem (and sometimes are) irrelevant to long   term   goals. A law student must learn every aspect of the law, regardless of   specific career plans. If you are interested in human rights law or   civil   liberties, you must be willing to learn a great deal about contracts,   torts,   civil procedure, corporate law, and taxation.    Similarly, although many prelaw   students   embrace the idea of a legal career because of a personal antipathy   toward   such quantitative disciplines as mathematics, economics, and the   sciences,   you must keep in mind that lawyers are most often called upon to deal   with   conflict, and since most conflict is financial (even in divorce cases)   the   horror of numbers simply cannot be avoided. You must be familiar with   accounting principles and know how to read a balance sheet, even if   you are   working for the National Resources Defense Council and attempting to   save a   pristine Alaskan forest.    Law school is a long, arduous, and   sometimes   monotonously indirect route that will eventually enable you to acquire   the   tools to effectively represent any client, from the largest   corporation to a   dispossessed tenement tenant.    Waiting to Apply to Law School: Many     students do not apply to law school until years after they have   graduated   from college. Indeed, at the most competitive law schools \u2014 such as our   own   and that of Harvard \u2014 more than 50% of the first year class have been   out of   school for at least one year. Given the choice, law school admissions   committees often prefer more mature and experienced applicants. If you   have   any doubt about going to law school, wait! Do something else \u2014 work,   travel,   volunteer. There is no \"track\" from which you are going to be   derailed.
