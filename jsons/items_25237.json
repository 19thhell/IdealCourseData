Our research and curriculum emphasize the study of global media and culture, digital media and new technologies, media history, visual culture, sound studies, media infrastructures, media activism, and political communication.    Students specialize in one of five Areas of Study: Global and Transcultural Studies , Technology and Society , Visual Culture and Cultural Studies , Persuasion and Politics , Interaction and Social Processes .    Grounded in the liberal arts and social sciences, the MCC program of study trains agile researchers, able to think critically from diverse perspectives about changing industries, technologies, and cultures. Students work with faculty from a wide variety of media studies disciplines, representing some of the world&rsquo;s most renowned scholars of media, technology, and culture.    The program is flexible, allowing electives by advisement across the University: interactive technology at NYU ITP , media business at NYU Stern , media law at the NYU School of Law , and digital design at NYU Poly , are just some of the elective options made available to MCC students. We also offer graduate study abroad courses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America that examine media in comparative contexts.    Media Studies in the World's Media Capital    Situated in the heart of Greenwich Village, MCC benefits from its location in one of the world's most vibrant and diverse cities. We take our location in New York City as both an inspiration and a resource. With frequent guest lectures and public events , MCC serves as an intellectual hub for visiting scholars, artists, activists, and industry experts.    Future Careers    Graduates of MCC's media studies program build careers as astute analyzers of the global media landscape. Our MA alumni find themselves well positioned for careers in both the public and private sectors &mdash; working in traditional and new media, research and policy, at cultural institutions and media start-ups. Many pursue doctoral study.                                     This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University. All rights reserved.
