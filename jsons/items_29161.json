This is an opportunity for in-depth reflection. At this review, you will meet with a panel of full-time faculty members to discuss your progression towards degree completion, the achievements you\u2019ve made, risks you\u2019ve taken, and challenges you've faced, as well as clarify your future goals and receive constructive feedback and valuable advice from faculty in regard to your proposed or intended career path. Candid advice may be given on directions for you to follow and possible areas of specialization. Specializations are not required and are not notated on transcripts. However, they are encouraged as a pathway to a successful capstone project, and ultimately, success after graduation. At this juncture, you are strongly recommended to continue to work collaboratively with your academic advisor to develop a course of study that will help shape your area of specialization and is tailored to your interests and future career goals. Please remember that, during your junior and senior years, you will be thinking about, planning, refining, and executing your capstone project. For your capstone project, you will be asked to develop a full creative plan to launch a music business venture in the area of your specialization. To receive faculty approval for your capstone project in your junior year, you will be required to demonstrate that you have taken, or plan to take, the necessary courses in your area of specialization. FAQs Why do I need to choose an area of specialization?  To create an academic plan based around your specialization which will enable you to envision your future career goals, and develop a realistic and achievable roadmap in support of these goals. It will also ensure that you develop the knowledge, professional competencies, and skills you need to increase your chances for success upon graduation To tailor an academic plan that will better prepare you for the process of conceptualizing, developing, testing, and executing your capstone projects during your junior and senior years To receive faculty approval for your capstone project in your junior year, you must demonstrate that you have taken, or plan to take, the necessary courses in your area of specialization How do I choose an area of specialization? Review the specialization descriptions below, and determine which one best describes the type of entrepreneurial venture you would like to pursue for your capstone project. Once you identify your specialization, you should also determine - along with your academic advisor - the sequence of courses that will enable you to achieve your academic goals. This entails researching the wide selection of elective courses listed in your area of specialization. To do this, you may review course descriptions or syllabi online, and upon consultation with your academic advisor, decide which courses will help you achieve your educational and career goals. What are the areas of specialization I can choose from?      The vast majority of the students who have been accepted into and graduate from Recorded Music have fallen into the following areas:    Executive Entrepreneur   Technology Entrepreneur   Social Entrepreneur   Producer Entrepreneur   Performer Entrepreneur   Songwriter Entrepreneur   Journalist Entrepreneur Please read through the description of each specialization carefully. If the area in which you would like to specialize is not represented here, you may propose a new category to your academic advisor. Do I have to choose from this list of courses? You are more than welcome to suggest your own sequence of courses, and have it approved by your academic advisor. We strongly encourage you to take the time to do additional research about courses offered in your desired area. Will these courses count toward my general education requirements? Most of these courses will count as elective credits towards your degree, and cannot be substituted for your general education requirements.

AREA OF SPECIALIZATION -      ENTREPRENEUR WITH A JOURNALISM, HISTORY OR CURATING FOCUS Do you want to use words and images to influence the tastes of millions of fans as well as artists and important industry figures?

This is an opportunity for in-depth reflection. At this review, you will meet with a panel of full-time faculty members to discuss your progression towards degree completion, the achievements you\u2019ve made, risks you\u2019ve taken, and challenges you've faced, as well as clarify your future goals and receive constructive feedback and valuable advice from faculty in regard to your proposed or intended career path. Candid advice may be given on directions for you to follow and possible areas of specialization. Specializations are not required and are not notated on transcripts. However, they are encouraged as a pathway to a successful capstone project, and ultimately, success after graduation. At this juncture, you are strongly recommended to continue to work collaboratively with your academic advisor to develop a course of study that will help shape your area of specialization and is tailored to your interests and future career goals. Please remember that, during your junior and senior years, you will be thinking about, planning, refining, and executing your capstone project. For your capstone project, you will be asked to develop a full creative plan to launch a music business venture in the area of your specialization. To receive faculty approval for your capstone project in your junior year, you will be required to demonstrate that you have taken, or plan to take, the necessary courses in your area of specialization. FAQs Why do I need to choose an area of specialization?  To create an academic plan based around your specialization which will enable you to envision your future career goals, and develop a realistic and achievable roadmap in support of these goals. It will also ensure that you develop the knowledge, professional competencies, and skills you need to increase your chances for success upon graduation To tailor an academic plan that will better prepare you for the process of conceptualizing, developing, testing, and executing your capstone projects during your junior and senior years To receive faculty approval for your capstone project in your junior year, you must demonstrate that you have taken, or plan to take, the necessary courses in your area of specialization How do I choose an area of specialization? Review the specialization descriptions below, and determine which one best describes the type of entrepreneurial venture you would like to pursue for your capstone project. Once you identify your specialization, you should also determine - along with your academic advisor - the sequence of courses that will enable you to achieve your academic goals. This entails researching the wide selection of elective courses listed in your area of specialization. To do this, you may review course descriptions or syllabi online, and upon consultation with your academic advisor, decide which courses will help you achieve your educational and career goals. What are the areas of specialization I can choose from?      The vast majority of the students who have been accepted into and graduate from Recorded Music have fallen into the following areas:    Executive Entrepreneur   Technology Entrepreneur   Social Entrepreneur   Producer Entrepreneur   Performer Entrepreneur   Songwriter Entrepreneur   Journalist Entrepreneur Please read through the description of each specialization carefully. If the area in which you would like to specialize is not represented here, you may propose a new category to your academic advisor. Do I have to choose from this list of courses? You are more than welcome to suggest your own sequence of courses, and have it approved by your academic advisor. We strongly encourage you to take the time to do additional research about courses offered in your desired area. Will these courses count toward my general education requirements? Most of these courses will count as elective credits towards your degree, and cannot be substituted for your general education requirements.

The semester-long series is also free and open to the public. Students will receive priority. For additional information, contact Martha Diaz, director of the Hip Hop Education Center at Martha.diaz@nyu.edu.   \u201cThe Hip-Hop Education Center continues to keep us connected to the current work in the field, but this time through technology,\u201d said Pedro Noguera, Metro Center director. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to collaborating with our partners to engage our students and the public at large in this Hip-Hop conversation to illustrate how this phenomenon continues to impact education, culture, and society.\u201d    Curated by Willie Ney, director of UW-Madison\u2019s Office of Multicultural Arts Initiative (OMAI) and HHEC Director Martha Diaz, the series will be hosted by Noguera and Ernest Morrell, director of the Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME). Guest speakers will include MC Lyte on the campus of UW-Madison, Chris Walker, Marcella Runell Hall, Jen Johnson, Christopher Emdin, and Carlos \u201cMare139\u201d Rodriguez. Class topics include: Promising Practices for Utilizing a Social Justice Hip-Hop Pedagogy: Notes from the Real World; Art for the Next Century: How Graffiti Transformed Contemporary Art and Remixed History; From the Source to the Course: Issues and Strategies for Collaborative Hip-Hop Scholarship; Rhyme, Rhythm &amp; Resistance: Afro-Cosmopolitanism, Art and Public Pedagogy in South Africa\u2019s Social Justice Struggles.   \u201cUW-Madison is proud to be in partnership with the Hip-Hop Education Center and its partners for \u201cGetting Real,\u201d said UW-Madison Vice Provost Damon A. Williams. \u201cOur role as the only university campus with a spoken-word and Hip-Hop arts residential learning community is magnified and supported through these innovative approaches to teaching an emerging discipline in cutting-edge art. This cooperative venture will bring learning into a virtual forum and result in the creation of a transcendent national instruction network.\u201d    Since launching in 2010, the HHEC has cultivated Hip-Hop scholars, teaching artists, cultural workers, activists, and social entrepreneurs to utilize the Hip-Hop power to educate and transform communities. A key strategy for the HHEC is to partner with institutions of higher learning and community building organizations in order to professionalize the field of Hip-Hop education and contribute best practices to the education reform movement at-large. One of the main goals of the HHEC, OMAI and IUME collaboration is to develop a teaching certificate for teaching artists, in-service teachers, and students of education using Hip-Hop in the classroom and extended-day programs.                         About The Office of Multicultural Arts Initiative (OMAI)  The Office of Multicultural Arts Initiatives (OMAI) provides culturally relevant and transformative arts programming to promote positive social dialogue and to give cultural art forms a legitimate academic forum. By harnessing the broad cultural influence of spoken word, hip hop and emerging, as well as traditional art forms, OMAI initiatives create learning environments that improve retention and graduation success and prepares future leaders to reinvest in their communities. By continually refreshing this paradigm that integrates traditional academics and cutting edge arts activism, OMAI empowers transnational leaders with new tools for inclusive community building. Founded in 2005, OMAI is a unit of the Office of the Vice Provost for Diversity and Climate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. http://omai.wisc.edu.     About The Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME)  The Institute for Urban and Minority Education (IUME) was created in 1973 to serve the interests of those students who are often hidden, disregarded, or underestimated.
