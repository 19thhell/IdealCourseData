I was very excited to land in London on September 4. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery.                  I was very excited to land in London on September 4, 2012. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery. I flew red-eye and was greeted with a warm welcome from my host, a fellow London Business School MBA 2013 student. He gave me a tour of the school, and I got my photo taken for my ID. From the grin of my face in the photo, I was extremely happy to become a part of the LBS community.  London Business School has a small self-contained campus, but it happens to border one of London&rsquo;s largest and most beautiful parks, Regent&rsquo;s Park:  London pubs offer some of the tastiest ciders around. The cider (below) is an exotic combination of apple &amp; black current. Apparently, some ciders are seasonal, and the one pictured is a very popular summer cider:  I had about 2 weeks to spend travelling before school started, so I used this time to visit my family in Paris. Immediately after getting off the Eurostar, I was lifted into a gastronomic heaven and feasted on fois gras, escargot, steak tartare, French onion soup and a whole host of wines and cheeses during my stay:  Macarons are very popular in Paris &ndash; they are a staple on the McDonald&rsquo;s menu (below). Although these macarons may look as good as those offered in Parisian patisseries, they did not have the same consistency or taste.  From Paris, I travelled by train to Cannes, where I was greeted by fancy yachts and upscale shops. I felt a bit star-struck, and in the photo (below), I am beside Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s handprint:  Next, I travelled to Cinque Terre, &ldquo;The Five Lands,&rdquo; which comprises of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare. The beauty of Cinque Terre left me speechless.  There is an option to travel by boat, train or hike from one city to another. I travelled by boat to the furthest city, Monterroso al Mare and spent a day soaking up the sun on the beach. That evening, I walked the &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore&rdquo; (the Way of Love), a pedestrian street overlooking the sea, which links the villages of Riomaggiore and Manarola. This was an easy 25-minute walk on a paved road that offered some amazing costal views. On this route, young lovers, wanting to seal their love, write their names on the padlocks and attach them to wire mesh:  Thinking that all hikes would be as easy as the one from the day before, I decided to hike from Monterosso to Vernazza. I was not properly equipped for this hike, as it turned out to be a fairly strenuous 1.5-2 hour hike, with steep inclines. On this route, I also found some padlocks reminding me of &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore.&rdquo; As the hike drew to an end, I was greeted by Vernazza&rsquo;s colorful harbor:  I continued with my obsession of coastal towns and took the train down through southern Italy, where I explored Positano, Sorrento, Pompeii and Capri. Positano was also very beautiful; however, its landscape was marred by a recent drought, leaving much of the land arid:  I absolutely loved the coastal town of Sorrento, known for its sea cliffs and limoncello liqueur. I only had a few hours to spend here, but plan to re-visit in the near future:   Having spent several years devoted to the study of Latin scriptures, I was very excited to explore the ruins of Pompeii, a city destructed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79:  In the last leg of my journey, I took a boat to Capri, which offered spectacular views, wonderful hikes, high-end shops and delicious granite (ice-slush).   From Capri, I took a bus to Anacapri, which sits at a much higher elevation. At Anacapri, I took a chair lift, not uncommon to those offered at ski resorts, and soaked in its beauty:  I ended my trip with a glass of limoncello &ndash; it was a perfect ending to a wonderful vacation.

Specialized programs are available in Africana studies, art and architecture, business, mathematics, British literature and writing, pre-health, and psychology. Courses in math, biology, chemistry, and physics accommodate students whose schedules might not otherwise allow for a semester of global study. Additionally, NYU is the only institution in London to offer science courses approved by the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) for medical school admittance. NYU London encourages students to enroll in for-credit internships with key institutions in fields including marketing, finance, media, law, politics, health, and theatre.     Students who spend a semester at NYU London live and learn in the heart of Bloomsbury, a neighborhood that is home to the British Museum, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, and the West End (London\u2019s famous theatre district).

I was very excited to land in London on September 4. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery.                  I was very excited to land in London on September 4, 2012. It marked the beginning of new friendships, exploration and self-discovery. I flew red-eye and was greeted with a warm welcome from my host, a fellow London Business School MBA 2013 student. He gave me a tour of the school, and I got my photo taken for my ID. From the grin of my face in the photo, I was extremely happy to become a part of the LBS community.  London Business School has a small self-contained campus, but it happens to border one of London&rsquo;s largest and most beautiful parks, Regent&rsquo;s Park:  London pubs offer some of the tastiest ciders around. The cider (below) is an exotic combination of apple &amp; black current. Apparently, some ciders are seasonal, and the one pictured is a very popular summer cider:  I had about 2 weeks to spend travelling before school started, so I used this time to visit my family in Paris. Immediately after getting off the Eurostar, I was lifted into a gastronomic heaven and feasted on fois gras, escargot, steak tartare, French onion soup and a whole host of wines and cheeses during my stay:  Macarons are very popular in Paris &ndash; they are a staple on the McDonald&rsquo;s menu (below). Although these macarons may look as good as those offered in Parisian patisseries, they did not have the same consistency or taste.  From Paris, I travelled by train to Cannes, where I was greeted by fancy yachts and upscale shops. I felt a bit star-struck, and in the photo (below), I am beside Angelina Jolie&rsquo;s handprint:  Next, I travelled to Cinque Terre, &ldquo;The Five Lands,&rdquo; which comprises of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare. The beauty of Cinque Terre left me speechless.  There is an option to travel by boat, train or hike from one city to another. I travelled by boat to the furthest city, Monterroso al Mare and spent a day soaking up the sun on the beach. That evening, I walked the &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore&rdquo; (the Way of Love), a pedestrian street overlooking the sea, which links the villages of Riomaggiore and Manarola. This was an easy 25-minute walk on a paved road that offered some amazing costal views. On this route, young lovers, wanting to seal their love, write their names on the padlocks and attach them to wire mesh:  Thinking that all hikes would be as easy as the one from the day before, I decided to hike from Monterosso to Vernazza. I was not properly equipped for this hike, as it turned out to be a fairly strenuous 1.5-2 hour hike, with steep inclines. On this route, I also found some padlocks reminding me of &ldquo;Via Dell&rsquo;Amore.&rdquo; As the hike drew to an end, I was greeted by Vernazza&rsquo;s colorful harbor:  I continued with my obsession of coastal towns and took the train down through southern Italy, where I explored Positano, Sorrento, Pompeii and Capri. Positano was also very beautiful; however, its landscape was marred by a recent drought, leaving much of the land arid:  I absolutely loved the coastal town of Sorrento, known for its sea cliffs and limoncello liqueur. I only had a few hours to spend here, but plan to re-visit in the near future:   Having spent several years devoted to the study of Latin scriptures, I was very excited to explore the ruins of Pompeii, a city destructed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79:  In the last leg of my journey, I took a boat to Capri, which offered spectacular views, wonderful hikes, high-end shops and delicious granite (ice-slush).   From Capri, I took a bus to Anacapri, which sits at a much higher elevation. At Anacapri, I took a chair lift, not uncommon to those offered at ski resorts, and soaked in its beauty:  I ended my trip with a glass of limoncello &ndash; it was a perfect ending to a wonderful vacation. I am looking forward to my semester at LBS!

As someone interested in the intersection of business and society, this is a great chance to gain international experience, develop a global business perspective, and expand my network on and off campus, all while getting a world-class education!                  Hi, my name is Rosie, and I am a second-year MBA student spending my Spring semester at London Business School (LBS). I came to Stern to transform my career by taking advantage of all the opportunities to immerse myself in global business. The highly international nature of the LBS program is greatly enhancing my MBA experience. It complements my professional and personal interest in international development. So as someone interested in the intersection of business and society, this is a great chance to gain international experience, develop a global business perspective, and expand my network on and off campus, all while getting a world-class education! Much like Stern, the people are what make LBS and London great. It is such a treat to connect with Sternies, fellow exchange students, and of course our classmates from LBS. The last four weeks were jam packed with adventures in London and beyond. At the start of the semester, Zach Erdmann and I organized a group lunch and visit to The National Gallery so that we could get to know our new friends in the program.  Almost every class at LBS includes a presentation from really engaging business leaders. Speakers have joined us from Arsenal Football Club, AB InBev, Expedia, The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Jarin Capital, and many more.  On Thursday nights everyone heads over to Sundowners, which is the LBS community&rsquo;s weekly get together. As the unofficial start to the weekend, this is a great chance to catch up with new and old friends over a few pints.  A big group of Sternies caught the Eurostar over to Paris for a long weekend. We had a great time exploring the city and enjoyed some amazing French cuisine.   I am a huge fan of the English Premier League. As an Arsenal supporter it was amazing to snag a ticket to see the Gooners 2-0 defeat of Fulham at Emirates Stadium.  Outside of LBS, I joined Run Dem Crew, a collective of creative types with a passion for running and the exchange of ideas. We meet every Tuesday night to run and explore the streets of London.  Cheers!
