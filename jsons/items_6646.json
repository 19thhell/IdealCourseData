Description       What does it mean to understand certain forms of violence as gendered violence? This course will explore this question in the context of international human rights. It may seem obvious that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights,\u201d and that personal and collective violence targeting women and girls (but also men and boys) on account of their gender must be addressed. And yet, competing gender norms raise highly contested questions about human rights with respect to gender, especially: When do human rights apply to acts of gender violence? Precisely who and what should human rights protect, and how are those rights best secured? The course will introduce students to contemporary feminist human rights movements, engage key debates in the field, and critically examine cases studies, such as: sexual violence as a war crime, sex trafficking, female genital cutting, and gender and poverty. The theme will also provide the basis for class discussions and writing assignments, culminating in a final research paper. Readings may include works by: Uma Narayan, Kelly D.

Description       What does it mean to understand certain forms of violence as gendered violence? This course will explore this question in the context of international human rights. It may seem obvious that \u201cwomen\u2019s rights are human rights,\u201d and that personal and collective violence targeting women and girls (but also men and boys) on account of their gender must be addressed. And yet, competing gender norms raise highly contested questions about human rights with respect to gender, especially: When do human rights apply to acts of gender violence? Precisely who and what should human rights protect, and how are those rights best secured? The course will introduce students to contemporary feminist human rights movements, engage key debates in the field, and critically examine cases studies, such as: sexual violence as a war crime, sex trafficking, female genital cutting, and gender and poverty. The theme will also provide the basis for class discussions and writing assignments, culminating in a final research paper. Readings may include works by: Uma Narayan, Kelly D. Askin, Catherine MacKinnon, Vasuki Nesiah, Karen Engle, Rutvica Andrijasevic, Sally Engle Merry, Susan Moller Okin, and Chandra Mohanty.
