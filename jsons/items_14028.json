Samsung says it has developed commercially viable 60 GHz millimeter-wave band Wi-Fi technology using the 802.11ad standard that enables data transmission speeds up to 4.6 Gbps. At these speeds, a 1 GB movie will take less than three seconds to transfer between devices and uncompressed HD videos can be streamed directly from mobile devices to TVs in real-time.   Wireless communications at 60 GHz are challenging because of the path loss caused by walls, trees and even the atmosphere. Samsung was able to meet these challenges through its millimeter-wave circuit designs, high-performance modem technologies, and its wide-coverage-beam-forming antenna. Its micro beam-forming control technology can optimize a communications module in less than 333 microseconds to respond to any changes in the communications environment.

Extensive help resources about connecting to NYU wireless can be found at http://www.nyu.edu/its/wireless/ .\u00a0There are multiple wireless networks available at ITP. As of Spring 2014, the most commonly used wireless networks are nyu , nyuguest , and itpsandbox . If you need help connecting a device to wireless, contact itp.helpdesk@nyu.edu or visit the ITP tech staff.    The itpsandbox wireless network   For most purposes, the nyu and nyuguest networks will be the only wireless networks you need. However, there is also a special wireless network available on the ITP floor named itpsandbox . This network has been created to allow students and faculty to experiment with networked devices, especially consumer devices that have no graphical interface or cannot perform the WPA2 Enterprise authentication required by the regular nyu \u00a0wireless network. Aside from just providing access to the Internet, itpsandbox is special for two reasons:  devices on itpsandbox can accept connections from the Internet (i.e. outside of NYU) devices on itpsandbox can communicate peer-to-peer with other devices on itpsandbox The itpsandbox  network is password protected with a specific password that you need to get from ITP Tech Staff . You can register up to two devices to use on itpsandbox . If you need to\u00a0 register more than two devices, or a\u00a0 device requires a statically-assigned IP address, you\u00a0 will \u00a0need to contact ITP Tech Staff for assistance.      Connection details     wireless network SSID (name): itpsandbox   encryption: WPA Personal   password: must be obtained from ITP Tech Staff network configuration: DHCP     Connecting to itpsandbox from a device that has a graphical interface   If your device has a graphical interface that allows you to browse available wifi networks and open a web browser on the device itself (e.g. Raspberry Pi), you can connect to the itpsandbox network by following these instructions:     Browse for the wireless network itpsandbox and connect to it   Enter the password for the itpsandbox \u00a0network (which you must get from the ITP Tech Staff)   Open a web browser on your device and go to this site: http://computer.registration.nyu.edu   Follow the instructions on that page to register your device to use the network   Shortly after you have completed the registration, your device should be able to connect to the Internet   For more information, you can read about this self-registration procedure here     Connecting to itpsandbox from a device that has no graphical interface     If your device has no graphical interface, you won't be able to use the instructions above. You can connect to the itpsandbox network by following these instructions:     You will first need to determine the hardware address of the device's wireless Ethernet adapter. Instructions for this procedure vary by device, so you will have to refer to your device documentation to find out how to find your device's wireless hardware address (also called a \"MAC address\") Go to a computer that already has Internet access   Open\u00a0a web browser on that computer and go to this site: http://computer.registration.nyu.edu   Select the option \"register some other device\" and enter the hardware address of your device   Using the connection details above, configure your device to connect to the itpsandbox network. This procedure also varies by device, so you will have to refer to your device documentation Shortly after you have completed the registration, and configured your device to connect, your device should be able to connect to the Internet For more information, you can read about this\u00a0 self-registration procedure \u00a0here (following the instructions for \"Registering and removing a game console or digital media device\")                                                    Sign in | Recent Site Activity | Report Abuse | Print Page | Powered By Google Sites"}]}]
