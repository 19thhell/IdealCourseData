Professor Emily Apter and Professor Jacques Lezra's translation of Barbara Cassin's Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon is out now from Princeton University Press! This is an encyclopedic dictionary of close to 400 important philosophical, literary, and political terms and concepts that defy easy--or any--translation from one language and culture to another. Drawn from more than a dozen languages, terms such as Dasein (German), pravda (Russian), saudade (Portuguese), and stato (Italian) are thoroughly examined in all their cross-linguistic and cross-cultural complexities. Spanning the classical, medieval, early modern, modern, and contemporary periods, these are terms that influence thinking across the humanities.

Rimbaud, la commune de Paris et l'invention de l'histoire spatiale is published by Les Prairies Ordinaires.

Professor Cristina Vatulescu was promoted to the position of associate professor with tenure, effective 9/1/2013. Congratulations, Cristina!     Emily Apter 's Book Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability is out now from Verso Books! The book argues for a rethinking of comparative literature focusing on the problems that emerge when large-scale paradigms of literary studies ignore the politics of the \u201cUntranslatable\u201d\u2014the realm of those words that are continually retranslated, mistranslated, transferred from language to language, or especially resistant to substitution.      Hala Halim 's Book Alexandrian Cosmopolitanism: An Archive is forthcoming from Fordham University Press. Interrogating how Alexandria became enshrined as the exemplary cosmopolitan space in the Middle East, this book mounts a radical critique of Eurocentric conceptions of cosmopolitanism. The dominant account of Alexandrian cosmopolitanism elevates things European in the city's culture and simultaneously places things Egyptian under the sign of decline. The book goes beyond this civilization/barbarism binary to trace other modes of intercultural solidarity.      Visiting Scholars for 2013-2014 :  Alice Blackhurst is   in the second year of her PhD in the French department at the University   of Cambridge. Her dissertation centers around ideas of luxury in   contemporary French thought, art and film.

Sagi Cohen is a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of   Ottawa, supervised by Dr. Dalie Giroux. His Dissertation - Homo   Perfidus: An Antipathology - tries to construct a \"responsible\" concept   of betrayal; a methodology. His guide through this Inferno is an   appropriately unholy matrimony between Nietzsche and Levinas, which   helps approach the accusation of 'traitor' in a   trans-valuative/affirmative manner; not a persecution of prejudgment,   but a phenomenological erring toward its trace(s) (as an ethics, as   philosophia prima).    News for 2012-2013 Professors Kamau  Brathwaite, John Chioles, Daniel Javitch , and Timothy Reiss have recently retired and been named Professor  Emeriti of Comparative Literature.

New Faculty Members       We're happy to announce six(!) new faculty members.  Having long been \"associated faculty\" and valuable contributors to  the department and discipline of comparative literature, Professors Emily  Apter , Gabriela Basterra , Ulrich Baer , and Avital Ronell became  voting joint faculty in January, 2006. With one foot in their original  departments and one in Comp Lit, they now join fully in our comparative mix.  The exciting results of last year's faculty searches, Assistant Professors Cristina  Vatulescu and Hala Halim also join our department in 2006-07.  Professor Vatulescu's research interest include aesthetics and politics;  artistic and extra-artistic genres, in particular the novel, autobiography, and  the police file; Russian and Eastern European twentieth century culture; cinema  and visual culture.

Translated from the French, these two pieces are poetic explorations of  animals, humans and the origins of language. In addition, Sieburth has included  Michaux's ideogrammic ink drawings to illustrate the explosive and  contemplative nature of the writer's verbal and pictorial gestures.      Professor Mark Sanders 's book Gayatri Chakravorty  Spivak: Live Theory has recently been published by Continuum International  Publishing Group. Concentrating on the thought of one of the world's most  provocative and original theorists, this book delves into Spivak's theories on  deconstruction, Marxisim, feminism and issues of postcoloniality and  globalization.

Kamau Brathwaite Wins Griffin Poetry Prize!       At a gala event in Toronto, Ontario ,  Professor Kamau Brathwaite was awarded the prestigious Griffen Poetry Prize  for his new volume of widely-acclaimed poetry Born to Slow Horses . The  Canadian-based Griffin Prize is the world's most valuable prize for poetry. In  the course of his career as a major contemporary poet and voice of the  Caribbean, Professor Brathwaite has also been awarded the Neustadt  International Prize for Literature,   Cuba's Casa de  las Americas Premio, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Fulbright Fellowship.       We are pleased to announce the promotion of Professor Ana  Maria Dopico to Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and Associate  Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; of Professor Mikhail Iampolski to  Professor of Comparative Literature and Professor of Russian and Slavic  Studies; and of Professor Xudong Zhang to Professor of Comparative  Literature and Professor of East Asian Studies.

A collection of Professor Zhang's  essays since 1985, Traces of Criticism: Essays in Cultural Theory and  Cultural Criticism , has recently appeared, as has his Cultural Identity  in the Age of Globalization .           Professor Kamau Brathwaite 's latest book of poetry,  from Wesleyan University Press, Born to Slow Horses, is a collection of  poetic meditations on islands and exile, language and ritual, and the force of  personal and historical passion and grief. In addition to unearthing the roots  of the Carribean culture, Brathwaite's experiences with New York City and 9/11 provide a modern  influence on his work. The subject of Brathwaite's poems run the gamut from the  slave children to BMW luxury cars. This eclectic mix provides insight into the  author's experiences with the history of the Carribean and the modern western  world.          CHINA TRIP! Professor Xudong Zhang organized and led  a delegaton of ten NYU graduate students to Shenzhen, Shanghai,  and Beijing to  participate in Sino-US symposia on comparative literature.

Weaving philosophy and humanity, its twelve whimsical stories bring the likes  of Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer, Heliodorus, and Shakespeare into the lives of  street urchins, displaced persons, and haunted students. As the Kastaniotis  description of Romeo the Pothead and Juliet the Snitch notes, \"A  burning fire hovers over these short stories. The conflagration is both real  and figurative, as deportation, immigration, exile....\" The Department of English at Morehouse College  in Atlanta is  sponsoring a Caribbean Literary Studies Symposium , to be held April  13-14, whose focus, and one of whose participants, will be Professor Kamau  Brathwaite .

Professor   Richard Sieburth 's new translation of Georg B\u00fcchner's Lenz has  just been published, in a lovely edition, by Archipelago Books. Harold Bloom  has called the volume \"both a superb version and a startling  interpretation of a great and vital work\"; Michael Palmer writes that,  \"for the first time, thanks to Richard Sieburth's astonishing skills, we  have a version in English that respects and communicates the radical  inventiveness and stylistic singularity of the original.\"      Professor   Nancy Ruttenburg has been invited to deliver the prestigious Ian Watt  Lecture on the History and Theory of the Novel at Stanford University.  The lecture, entitled \"Simplifying the Novel,\" will be given on  January 18th at the Center for the Study of the Novel, which has recently  fallen under the direction of Professor Margaret Cohen.

King , both of whom received their Ph.D.s from  the Department, are participants in a conference entitled \"Yari Yari  Pamberi: Black Women Writers Dissecting Globalization\" to be held October  12-16. \"The goal of this conference,\" its organizers state,  \"is to expand and intensify debates around globalization, explore  possibilities and contradictions, continue strengthening ties among women of  African descent, promote their literature, create a platform for young emerging  writers and raise public awareness about global developments.\" Fulani will  be among those addressing the question of \"the impact of new technologies  and globalization on Literature, Publishing and Distribution\"; King will  take part in a reading and discussion at the Poets' House. Other speakers  include Professor Manthia Diawara , Maya Angelou, Lucille Clifton,  Octavia Butler, Gloria Naylor, Alice Walker, and Edwidge Danticat.      Professors   Andrew Ross and Kristin Ross are the editors of Anti-Americanism ,  a collection of essays published in October by NYU Press. The volume, whose  contributors include, in addition to its editors, Professor Ana Maria Dopico   and CompLit associated faculty member Mary Louise Pratt , offers  considerations of anti-American opinion and sentiment in Latin America, the  Middle East, Europe, East Asia, and the United States, and provides what Neil  Smith calls \"the best, most comprehensive and most critical survey of  anti-Americanism available.\"                                                                             Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

New Faculty Members       We're happy to announce six(!) new faculty members.  Having long been \"associated faculty\" and valuable contributors to  the department and discipline of comparative literature, Professors Emily  Apter , Gabriela Basterra , Ulrich Baer , and Avital Ronell became  voting joint faculty in January, 2006. With one foot in their original  departments and one in Comp Lit, they now join fully in our comparative mix.  The exciting results of last year's faculty searches, Assistant Professors Cristina  Vatulescu and Hala Halim also join our department in 2006-07.  Professor Vatulescu's research interest include aesthetics and politics;  artistic and extra-artistic genres, in particular the novel, autobiography, and  the police file; Russian and Eastern European twentieth century culture; cinema  and visual culture. A joint appointment with Middle Eastern and Islamic  Studies, Professor Halim will begin in January 2007. Her first Comp Lit course  will be a graduate seminar \"Postcoloniality and Translation\" and her  cross-listed undergraduate course from MEIS will be \"Topics in Modern  Arabic Culture: Globalization and the Middle East.\"            New Faculty Books       Professor Richard Sieburth 's latest book from Archipelago Books, Stroke  by Stroke, is a pairing of two of Henri Michaux's most suggestive texts.  Translated from the French, these two pieces are poetic explorations of  animals, humans and the origins of language. In addition, Sieburth has included  Michaux's ideogrammic ink drawings to illustrate the explosive and  contemplative nature of the writer's verbal and pictorial gestures.      Professor Mark Sanders 's book Gayatri Chakravorty  Spivak: Live Theory has recently been published by Continuum International  Publishing Group. Concentrating on the thought of one of the world's most  provocative and original theorists, this book delves into Spivak's theories on  deconstruction, Marxisim, feminism and issues of postcoloniality and  globalization. A concise, comprehensive and accessible text, Sanders's latest work  explores Spivak's own questions about literacy and intellectual responsibility,  and also includes a new interview with Spivak herself.          Kamau Brathwaite Wins Griffin Poetry Prize!       At a gala event in Toronto, Ontario ,  Professor Kamau Brathwaite was awarded the prestigious Griffen Poetry Prize  for his new volume of widely-acclaimed poetry Born to Slow Horses . The  Canadian-based Griffin Prize is the world's most valuable prize for poetry. In  the course of his career as a major contemporary poet and voice of the  Caribbean, Professor Brathwaite has also been awarded the Neustadt  International Prize for Literature,   Cuba's Casa de  las Americas Premio, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Fulbright Fellowship.       We are pleased to announce the promotion of Professor Ana  Maria Dopico to Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and Associate  Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; of Professor Mikhail Iampolski to  Professor of Comparative Literature and Professor of Russian and Slavic  Studies; and of Professor Xudong Zhang to Professor of Comparative  Literature and Professor of East Asian Studies. Professor Dopico's new book, Houses  Divided: Genealogical Imaginaries and Political Visions in the Americas , is  forthcoming from Duke University Press, and she is editing a two volume  selection of Jose Marti's prose works for the Library of Latin America.  Professor Iampolski received the Andrei Bely Prize in Literature for his Physiology  of the Symbolic , released last year. A collection of Professor Zhang's  essays since 1985, Traces of Criticism: Essays in Cultural Theory and  Cultural Criticism , has recently appeared, as has his Cultural Identity  in the Age of Globalization .           Professor Kamau Brathwaite 's latest book of poetry,  from Wesleyan University Press, Born to Slow Horses, is a collection of  poetic meditations on islands and exile, language and ritual, and the force of  personal and historical passion and grief. In addition to unearthing the roots  of the Carribean culture, Brathwaite's experiences with New York City and 9/11 provide a modern  influence on his work. The subject of Brathwaite's poems run the gamut from the  slave children to BMW luxury cars. This eclectic mix provides insight into the  author's experiences with the history of the Carribean and the modern western  world.          CHINA TRIP! Professor Xudong Zhang organized and led  a delegaton of ten NYU graduate students to Shenzhen, Shanghai,  and Beijing to  participate in Sino-US symposia on comparative literature.  Professor John Chioles 's book Romeo  the Pothead and Juliet the Snitch has recently been published (2004, in  Greek) by Kastaniotis Editions in Athens.  Weaving philosophy and humanity, its twelve whimsical stories bring the likes  of Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer, Heliodorus, and Shakespeare into the lives of  street urchins, displaced persons, and haunted students. As the Kastaniotis  description of Romeo the Pothead and Juliet the Snitch notes, \"A  burning fire hovers over these short stories. The conflagration is both real  and figurative, as deportation, immigration, exile....\" The Department of English at Morehouse College  in Atlanta is  sponsoring a Caribbean Literary Studies Symposium , to be held April  13-14, whose focus, and one of whose participants, will be Professor Kamau  Brathwaite .

Professor Emily Apter and Professor Jacques Lezra's translation of Barbara Cassin's Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon is out now from Princeton University Press! This is an encyclopedic dictionary of close to 400 important philosophical, literary, and political terms and concepts that defy easy--or any--translation from one language and culture to another. Drawn from more than a dozen languages, terms such as Dasein (German), pravda (Russian), saudade (Portuguese), and stato (Italian) are thoroughly examined in all their cross-linguistic and cross-cultural complexities. Spanning the classical, medieval, early modern, modern, and contemporary periods, these are terms that influence thinking across the humanities. Professor Richard Sieburth's translation of Nostradamus' Prophecies is out now from Penguin! Professor Kristin Ross' book was translated into French. Rimbaud, la commune de Paris et l'invention de l'histoire spatiale is published by Les Prairies Ordinaires. Professor Hala Halim was promoted to the position of associate professor with tenure, effective 1/15/2014. Congratulations, Hala! Professor Cristina Vatulescu was promoted to the position of associate professor with tenure, effective 9/1/2013. Congratulations, Cristina!     Emily Apter 's Book Against World Literature: On the Politics of Untranslatability is out now from Verso Books! The book argues for a rethinking of comparative literature focusing on the problems that emerge when large-scale paradigms of literary studies ignore the politics of the \u201cUntranslatable\u201d\u2014the realm of those words that are continually retranslated, mistranslated, transferred from language to language, or especially resistant to substitution.      Hala Halim 's Book Alexandrian Cosmopolitanism: An Archive is forthcoming from Fordham University Press. Interrogating how Alexandria became enshrined as the exemplary cosmopolitan space in the Middle East, this book mounts a radical critique of Eurocentric conceptions of cosmopolitanism. The dominant account of Alexandrian cosmopolitanism elevates things European in the city's culture and simultaneously places things Egyptian under the sign of decline. The book goes beyond this civilization/barbarism binary to trace other modes of intercultural solidarity.      Visiting Scholars for 2013-2014 :  Alice Blackhurst is   in the second year of her PhD in the French department at the University   of Cambridge. Her dissertation centers around ideas of luxury in   contemporary French thought, art and film.

Sagi Cohen is a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of   Ottawa, supervised by Dr. Dalie Giroux. His Dissertation - Homo   Perfidus: An Antipathology - tries to construct a \"responsible\" concept   of betrayal; a methodology. His guide through this Inferno is an   appropriately unholy matrimony between Nietzsche and Levinas, which   helps approach the accusation of 'traitor' in a   trans-valuative/affirmative manner; not a persecution of prejudgment,   but a phenomenological erring toward its trace(s) (as an ethics, as   philosophia prima).    News for 2012-2013 Professors Kamau  Brathwaite, John Chioles, Daniel Javitch , and Timothy Reiss have recently retired and been named Professor  Emeriti of Comparative Literature.    Kamau, John, Daniel &amp; Tim: We can\u2019t thank you enough for your valued  years of service and the honor their scholarship has brought to the  Department.

Translated from the French, these two pieces are poetic explorations of  animals, humans and the origins of language. In addition, Sieburth has included  Michaux's ideogrammic ink drawings to illustrate the explosive and  contemplative nature of the writer's verbal and pictorial gestures.      Professor Mark Sanders 's book Gayatri Chakravorty  Spivak: Live Theory has recently been published by Continuum International  Publishing Group.

Kamau Brathwaite Wins Griffin Poetry Prize!       At a gala event in Toronto, Ontario ,  Professor Kamau Brathwaite was awarded the prestigious Griffen Poetry Prize  for his new volume of widely-acclaimed poetry Born to Slow Horses . The  Canadian-based Griffin Prize is the world's most valuable prize for poetry. In  the course of his career as a major contemporary poet and voice of the  Caribbean, Professor Brathwaite has also been awarded the Neustadt  International Prize for Literature,   Cuba's Casa de  las Americas Premio, the Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Fulbright Fellowship.       We are pleased to announce the promotion of Professor Ana  Maria Dopico to Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and Associate  Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; of Professor Mikhail Iampolski to  Professor of Comparative Literature and Professor of Russian and Slavic  Studies; and of Professor Xudong Zhang to Professor of Comparative  Literature and Professor of East Asian Studies. Professor Dopico's new book, Houses  Divided: Genealogical Imaginaries and Political Visions in the Americas , is  forthcoming from Duke University Press, and she is editing a two volume  selection of Jose Marti's prose works for the Library of Latin America.  Professor Iampolski received the Andrei Bely Prize in Literature for his Physiology  of the Symbolic , released last year. A collection of Professor Zhang's  essays since 1985, Traces of Criticism: Essays in Cultural Theory and  Cultural Criticism , has recently appeared, as has his Cultural Identity  in the Age of Globalization .           Professor Kamau Brathwaite 's latest book of poetry,  from Wesleyan University Press, Born to Slow Horses, is a collection of  poetic meditations on islands and exile, language and ritual, and the force of  personal and historical passion and grief. In addition to unearthing the roots  of the Carribean culture, Brathwaite's experiences with New York City and 9/11 provide a modern  influence on his work. The subject of Brathwaite's poems run the gamut from the  slave children to BMW luxury cars. This eclectic mix provides insight into the  author's experiences with the history of the Carribean and the modern western  world.          CHINA TRIP! Professor Xudong Zhang organized and led  a delegaton of ten NYU graduate students to Shenzhen, Shanghai,  and Beijing to  participate in Sino-US symposia on comparative literature.

Weaving philosophy and humanity, its twelve whimsical stories bring the likes  of Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer, Heliodorus, and Shakespeare into the lives of  street urchins, displaced persons, and haunted students. As the Kastaniotis  description of Romeo the Pothead and Juliet the Snitch notes, \"A  burning fire hovers over these short stories. The conflagration is both real  and figurative, as deportation, immigration, exile....\" The Department of English at Morehouse College  in Atlanta is  sponsoring a Caribbean Literary Studies Symposium , to be held April  13-14, whose focus, and one of whose participants, will be Professor Kamau  Brathwaite .

Professor   Richard Sieburth 's new translation of Georg B\u00fcchner's Lenz has  just been published, in a lovely edition, by Archipelago Books. Harold Bloom  has called the volume \"both a superb version and a startling  interpretation of a great and vital work\"; Michael Palmer writes that,  \"for the first time, thanks to Richard Sieburth's astonishing skills, we  have a version in English that respects and communicates the radical  inventiveness and stylistic singularity of the original.\"      Professor   Nancy Ruttenburg has been invited to deliver the prestigious Ian Watt  Lecture on the History and Theory of the Novel at Stanford University.  The lecture, entitled \"Simplifying the Novel,\" will be given on  January 18th at the Center for the Study of the Novel, which has recently  fallen under the direction of Professor Margaret Cohen.       Professor   Nancy Ruttenburg will deliver one of two keynote addresses at a  reception for the Fales Library Graduate Student Exhibit \"Circles and  Circulations in the Revolutionary Atlantic World.\" Professor Ruttenburg's  lecture, entitled \"Carwin the Inalienable Alien,\" will be followed by  another, \"Fever,\" given by Professor Samuel Otter of the English  Department at Berkeley; the two lectures will be followed in turn by the  reception. The event, to be held in the Fales Library Reading Room, begins at  4:00 on Friday, October 22.      Ifeona  Fulani and Rosamond S. King , both of whom received their Ph.D.s from  the Department, are participants in a conference entitled \"Yari Yari  Pamberi: Black Women Writers Dissecting Globalization\" to be held October  12-16. \"The goal of this conference,\" its organizers state,  \"is to expand and intensify debates around globalization, explore  possibilities and contradictions, continue strengthening ties among women of  African descent, promote their literature, create a platform for young emerging  writers and raise public awareness about global developments.\" Fulani will  be among those addressing the question of \"the impact of new technologies  and globalization on Literature, Publishing and Distribution\"; King will  take part in a reading and discussion at the Poets' House. Other speakers  include Professor Manthia Diawara , Maya Angelou, Lucille Clifton,  Octavia Butler, Gloria Naylor, Alice Walker, and Edwidge Danticat.      Professors   Andrew Ross and Kristin Ross are the editors of Anti-Americanism ,  a collection of essays published in October by NYU Press. The volume, whose  contributors include, in addition to its editors, Professor Ana Maria Dopico   and CompLit associated faculty member Mary Louise Pratt , offers  considerations of anti-American opinion and sentiment in Latin America, the  Middle East, Europe, East Asia, and the United States, and provides what Neil  Smith calls \"the best, most comprehensive and most critical survey of  anti-Americanism available.\"                                                                             Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "Literature Faculty, Department of English | NYU                                      NEW YORK UNIVERSITY       ARTS AND SCIENCE       COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE       GRADUATE SCHOOL OF ARTS AND SCIENCE                                                                                       Home     People     Undergraduate Program       Graduate Programs       Leaves and Committees       Events       Newsletter       Employment       Donate to the English Department       Faculty Only               Home &gt; People       Literature Faculty         John M.
