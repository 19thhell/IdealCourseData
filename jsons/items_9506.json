Even casual observers of film history are aware of the Third Reich\u2019s relationship with the German film industry\u2014but what about its Axis ally Italy? How did it develop under fascism? How did it serve the interests of the regime? Few people know that many of Italian cinema's leading lights, from Federico Fellini to Roberto Rossellini to Michelangelo Antonioni, got their start in the Fascist film industry.   In the award-winning Italian Fascism\u2019s Empire Cinema , Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of Italian Studies and history at NYU, offers the first in-depth examination of the feature and documentary films made by Rossellini and others about Italy\u2019s African and Balkan occupations during Mussolini\u2019s dictatorship.   At the event, Ben-Ghiat, along with Richard Pe\u00f1a, former director of the New York Film Festival and a professor at Columbia University, Joseph Luzzi of Bard College, and Stanislao Pugliese of Hofstra University will discuss the link between Mussolini\u2019s regime and the Italian film industry.

In this class our aim is to read a range of difficult texts from both antiquity and modernity slowly and carefully, examining closely a series of important philosophical conjunctions. By examining these scenes of reception, both the ancient text and the modern shed light upon one another \u2013why do certain ancient texts come to illustrate and illuminate modern philosophy, and how do modern concerns come to re-animate the ancient texts? The conjunctions will include Sophocles\u2019 Antigone and Hegel; Presocratic philosophy and Nietzsche; Sophocles\u2019 Oedipus Tyrannos and Freud; Plato\u2019s Phaedrus and Derrida; Plato\u2019s Republic and Irigaray; Antigone and Judith Butler. This class recommended for students with some experience with theory and continental philosophy who wish to deepen their understanding of these difficult thinkers. Topics: Lyric Subjectivity and Transculturation Duffy This course will explore the development of lyric poetry from the troubadours to the European metaphysicals, exploring imitation, competition, and anxiety as driving forces of lyric production within a transcultural framework. Primary Texts will include works by Arnaut Daniel, Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Garcilaso de la Vega, Lu\u00eds Vas de Cam\u00f5es, Joachim du Bellay, Pierre de Ronsard, Jan Van der Noot, Sir Philip Sidney, Edmund Spenser, John Donne, Jean de Sponde, Francisco de Quevedo, Fernando Herrera, Giambattista Marino, George Herbert, and Richard Crashaw. Critical works will include those by Thomas Greene, Leonard Forster, Teodolinda Barolini, Roland Greene, Terence Cave, Maria Rosa Menocal, Ignacio Navarette, Mario Praz, Gilles Deleuze, Heather DuBrow, and others.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Enlightenment Evil Gadberry This semester, we will investigate a series of attempts to justify the existence of evil in the world \u2013 and in us. As we read poems, novels, letters, and works of philosophy of the long eighteenth century, we will study the complaints hurled at an incomprehensibly unjust universe in a moment known for its confidence in the powers of the understanding. Our inquiry will take us from texts that try to justify a system that makes us rotten from the very beginning, to works that suggest we live in the best of possible worlds, to scathing satires of these defenses, and \u2013 most scandalously of all \u2013 to outright celebrations of wickedness. We will look at the impersonal evil of natural calamities (in the writings that emerged around the devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755) to the carefully wrought cruelties of sadism (in the Marquis deSade\u2019s Justine, for instance). As we do so, we\u2019ll think about how Enlightenment reason grapples with problems that seem to resist reason, how Enlightenment optimism stands up to critique, and how some instrumentalize (and even eroticize!) reason in pursuit of amoral pleasures. Required works will include the following primary works, many of which will be available in a coursepack: Kant, \u201cOn the Miscarriage of All Philosophical Trials in Theodicy\u201d; Kleist, \u201cThe Earthquake in Chile\u201d; Laclos, Dangerous Liaisons; Leibniz, Theodicy (selections); John Milton, Paradise Lost (selections); Pope, \u201cAn Essay on Man\u201d; Rousseau, letter to Voltaire defending Pope and Leibniz and selections from the Confessions and Social Contract; Sade, Justine; Voltaire, Candide and \u201cPoem on the Lisbon Disaster.\u201d The coursepack will also include secondary readings by Bakunin, Foucault, Lacan, and others.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Cosmopolitanism and Urban Spaces Halim The notion of cosmopolitanism has been associated, traditionally, with the city, the cosmopolite being conceived of as a privileged urbanite. Although much has changed in the way we have come to think of cosmopolitanism in recent years, we still need to ask: to what extent is everyone potentially a cosmopolite nowadays? Are there good and bad candidates for that status, and if so, what are the criteria, and who gets to decide? Are all the world\u2019s cities global cities? And what of \u201cvillage\u201d in \u201cglobal village\u201d? If we bear in mind that a substantial portion of the world\u2019s population still lives in relatively deprived semi-rural areas, how would that alter our understanding of this new cosmopolitanism, or propose other forms? In what way does the city-bred cosmopolite\u2019s thirst for pastoral images and idyllic vistas impact peasants and the countryside? What, if any, are the tactics to which rural migrants in big urban centers resort to rework old patterns of belonging and forge new attachments? In this course, we will attend to these and other questions of cosmopolitanism and globalization in rural and urban spaces through theory, literary texts and films from the Middle East, Europe and the USA.    Topics in 20th Century Literature: Violence and Technology Kaffen Frequently characterized as an aberration within modernity, pervasive violence in its various forms (war, terror, crime, culture) has proven disastrously resistant to the ideals of the enlightenment, throwing them into question if not crisis. More, its relationship to technology in particular remains among the most fraught legacies of modernity. Indeed, the intersections of technology and violence have engendered the most profound critical debates and contentious cultural and artistic works of the twentieth century. In the interest of grappling with the ever increasing complexity of this relationship, we will read a broad array of critical writings on violence and technology, as they intersect with questions of politics, security, and sovereignty. At the same time, we will pay attention to the cultural and artistic expressions that critically engage with these issues from literature, music, architecture, painting, photography, cinema, video games, and assorted new media. Readings will include Eyal Weizman, George Bataille, Paul Virilio, Sasaki Ataru, TJ Clark, Walter Benjamin, Adriana Caverero, Hannah Arendt, Carl von Clausewitz, Ariella Azoulay, Jean Genet, Michel Foucault, Carl Schmitt, George Didi- Huberman, W.G. Sebald, Ernst Junger.  Topics: Fascism/Violence/Memory: The Case of the Spanish Civil War Matos-Martin The Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) is the defining event in Spanish modern history as well as widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those three years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of the course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice.  Topics in 19th Century History: Century Literary History: Arthur Rimbaud Ross A seminar devoted to the poetry, cultural, and political context of Arthur Rimbaud.   Students must have some reading knowledge of French (there will surely be differing   levels of familiarity with French in the group) and a good French dictionary. Discussion conducted in English.  Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.
