[ Direct link ]   These pages provide guidance on forwarding your official NYU E-mail address (NetID@nyu.edu) and resetting your NYU password.       Appropriate Use of E-mail at New York University Policy    http://www.nyu.edu/its/policies/email.html    Summary: This University policy explains that E-mail is considered an official means of communication at New York University. Forwarding e-mail does not absolve an individual of the responsibilities associated with communication sent to his or her official NYU E-mail address (NetID@nyu.edu).      Your NetID &amp; Password(s)    http://www.nyu.edu/its/netid/    Summary: This page explains how to activate your NYU NetID and set your password(s).      Forward mail to another account    https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957    Summary: This Google page explains how to setup email forwarding from your NYU email account ( http://email.nyu.edu ).      NYU Email: Automatically forwarding messages to another email account    http://www.nyu.edu/servicelink/041124216573816 Summary: This NYU ITS page explains how to setup email forwarding from your NYU email account ( http://email.nyu.edu ).            How do I get an NYU ID if I am not an NYU student or employee?       [ Direct link ]   Affiliate ID cards are available to interns or volunteers working in research labs in the Biology Department. ID cards are necessary in order to gain swipe access to restricted lab areas. These requests must be processed through NYU\u2019s legal channels and the entire process takes about a week to complete if the steps are followed closely and quickly. Affiliate completes the \u201cResearch Affiliate ID\u201d questionnaire with their PI (faculty sponsor). The PI forwards the questionnaire to their Department Administrator (Julie Kim, Silver Complex or Carrie Nygard, CGSB) who will initiate the process with the legal office. The Department Administrator will contact the affiliate and PI once the legal department sends the Volunteer Agreement Form and the Release Form for the affiliate to complete and sign. If the affiliate is a minor then a parent or guardian will also have to sign. Bring the original hard copies to the Department Administrator for processing. Once Legal and HR have approved the request, the Department Administrator notifies the affiliate that the ID Authorization Form is ready for pick up. The form is taken to an NYU Card Center located at 383 Lafayette Street. Hours of operation can be found on their website . Once the affiliate has their ID card, they can request access. See the FAQ on how to request lab access.  NOTES ON RENEWALS: The legal department determines how long Affiliate IDs are active. Right now they have set a 3 month limit. This means that the PI, Affiliate, and Administrator will have to repeat this process every 3 months for the duration that the affiliate is at NYU. If you need to renew a Research Affiliate ID card, please initiate the process with your Department Administrator at least 2 weeks prior to the current card\u2019s expiration date. You will have to get a new ID card with each extension. Be sure to surrender your old ID or you will be charged a $15 replacement fee.       How do I get swipe access? Change my access? Or fix my access?       [ Direct link ]   To request access for the first time: Complete the Building Access Application form on our forms page . The form must be signed by your PI or your labs designee. Submit the completed form to the Administrative Aide in the Biology Department Office located on the 10th floor of the Silver Building, room 1009. Alternately you can deliver your form to the 8th floor of the CGSB if you are located in that building. It can take up to 72 hours for security to make our requested changes.  To change my swipe access: If you already have a Building Access Application form on file, you may email a requested change or addition to biology@nyu.edu. You must cc your PI for approval. Again, allow 72 hours for the change to go into effect. My card stopped working, what do I do?: Send an email to biology@nyu.edu. In the email include your name, N#, net ID, and the location where your access did not work (building, floor, room). The administrator will contact the card Center on your behalf to resolve the problem. If you recently graduated then your student ID card has probably been deactivated. In order to continue working in your PIs lab (unpaid), they will need to request a Research Affiliate ID Card for you. Please see the FAQ on \u201cHow do I get an NYU ID if I am not an NYU student or employee\u201d here . If you have a Research Affiliate ID, please make sure your card is not expired. You may need to renew it. See the FAQ on \u201cHow do I get an NYU ID if I am not an NYU student or employee\u201d here .       How do I register my computer/laptop on the Department's network?       [ Direct link ]   Fill out the Computer Registration Request Form found on our forms page . Email your completed form to fas.bio.computing@nyu.edu . Allow up to 24 hours for activation. If you are a visitor, a secure network password can be provided to you by a faculty or staff member. The weekly password is available to them under the \"Faculty Handbook and Forms\" link on our forms page .       How do I renew my Research Affiliate ID?       [ Direct link ]   The legal department determines how long Affiliate IDs are active. Right now Legal has set a 3 month limit. This means that the PI, Affiliate, and Administrator will have to repeat this application process every 3 months for the duration that the affiliate is at NYU. If you need to renew a Research Affiliate ID Card, please initiate the process with your Department Administrator at least 2 weeks prior to the current card\u2019s expiration date. You will have to get a new ID card with each extension. Be sure to surrender your old ID or you will be charged a $15 replacement fee. See the FAQ on how to request an Affiliate ID for the full protocol and questionnaire here.       How do I reserve the auditorium or a classroom in the CGSB (Center for Genomics & Systems Biology, 12 Waverly Place)?       [ Direct link ]   The auditorium and classrooms in the Genome Center (12 Waverly Place) do not belong exclusively to the Biology Department. They are considered general use classrooms and are therefore managed by Classroom Assignments. Please work with them to secure the room for your event by emailing classroom.scheduling@nyu.edu. Because these rooms are used for classes, scheduling meetings during the academic year can be difficult and often Classroom Assignments can not confirm space requests until the semester is underway and classes are all assigned rooms (since priority is given to using these rooms as classrooms). If you are a member of NYU Biology, an administrator from the department will work with Classroom Assignments on your behalf. Contact Carrie Nygard (cen249@nyu.edu, x88341) and cc Michelle Devol (mrd3@nyu.edu, x88209) with the date, time and a brief description of your meeting/event. We will do our best to help you gain access to the space you need. If you are interested in scheduling your course into the Genome Center please be aware of a few things. While Biology does not manage these rooms directly, the Department gets priority booking for its courses (other Science Departments get priority after Biology and before non-science departments). When requesting a classroom in the Genome Center, you increase your chances of getting space if you qualify for priority.      The course enrollment should be at least 80% of the room\u2019s capacity (see chart below).    The enrollment cap of the course (as listed in Albert) can not be greater than the room\u2019s capacity.    The course needs to follow a traditional NYU course schedule. For example; a course that meets on Mon and Wed from 11am-12:15pm is a traditional schedule. A course that only meets once a week for a longer period of time is not a traditional schedule.      A course which does not meet criteria 1&amp;3 may still receive a room in the Genome Center, however without priority the chances are not as good. There is no guarantee that a request will be granted even with priority since NYU has an overall classroom shortage.             12 Waverly Classroom Information       Room Number    Location    Capacity    Style    80% Capacity       108  Ground Floor 138 Auditorium 110    L1 11 Cellar    22 Computer Lab 17    L1 13 Cellar    20 Recitation Style 16    L1 14 Cellar    20 Recitation Style 16    L1 20 Cellar    69 Lecture Hall 55                   Undergraduate       As a Biology major, can I get help finding a lab in which to do research?       [ Direct link ]   Yes. General advice about finding a research opportunity is available on the BioDUGS blog . You may also speak with a faculty member in your field of interest to get advice on which labs do research in this field and on how to contact a professor about joining his or her lab. To do this, send an email to biology.dugs@nyu.edu with \"finding a lab\" as the subject line, and be sure to specify what areas of biology you are interested in.       How can I find out what courses may be offered this year?       [ Direct link ]   The best place to check for course information is always on ALBERT. However we have a PDF course offering sheet that you can use to help with planning. It is on the Undergraduate Program page under useful links. It is subject to change but we attempt to keep it as up to date as possible.       How do I declare Biology as my major or minor?       [ Direct link ]   Declaring Biology as your major or minor is easy. Visit the forms page of our website and fill out the majors or minors declaration form. Submit it to the Undergraduate Administrative Aide in the Biology Department located on the 10th floor of the Silver Center, room 1009. Students who declare Biology as their major will be assigned a faculty adviser and will be invited to join our listserv for majors called BioNews. This is the main form of communication between the Department and majors for announcements and reminders. As a Sophomore or Junior can I become a Biology major? If you are a current Sophomore, yes you can still be a Biology major,   provided that you have completed both (a) Principles of Biology-I, -II   and (b) General Chemistry-I, -II. The courses you will need to register   for as a Junior are: Molecular and Cell Biology, Organic Chemistry, and   possibly an upper-level Biology course if you feel you can handle three   science courses in a semester. Otherwise you can complete the five   upper-level Biology courses in your Senior year. Please keep in mind   that this option limits what Biology electives you can complete. You   will need to complete the required Physics courses in your senior year,   so you must consider possible course conflicts. If you are a   current Junior, you will probably need an extra year to complete the   Biology requirements, depending on the Placement/Transfer credits you   have. How do I undeclare Biology as my major or minor? To undeclare download the undeclare major or minor forms on our forms page and submit them to the same person listed above.       How do I get my poster printed in the Biology office?       [ Direct link ]   Email your poster to fas.bio.computing@nyu.edu in one of the following formats: PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Adobe Illustrator. We stock 36 inch wide HP Semi-Gloss paper and recommend setting the document dimensions to 36 x 48 inches with 0 inch margins when creating your poster. Borderless prints are only available for 36 x 48 inch documents. Keep important text or images at least 6 millimeters from the poster's edge since the printer automatically enlarges the poster slightly in order to print over the edges of the paper. Posters are not waterproof. We recommend bringing a poster tube or plastic bag when rain is expected. Printing of draft copies and reprints is strongly discouraged. If you are participating in the annual Undergraduate Research Conference, MS poster session or the annual Non-retreating Retreat, please allow plenty of time to print your poster. The printer gets backlogged before these events.          How do I transfer credits to my biology major or minor?       [ Direct link ]   If you are trying to transfer credits you previously earned before entering NYU (from a different school), NYU admissions has to first accept the credits. Next you will need to obtain a syllabus that includes information about the textbook used in the course, the   topics covered week-by-week, and how the course grade was generated (a   course description is NOT a syllabus!) for the course you are trying to apply to your Biology major or minor. The Assistant Director of the Biology undergraduate program will review the syllabus and determine if the course can be applied to the major or minor. You can arrange for the Assistant Director review through the Undergraduate Administrative Aide. Why don't my transfer credits appear on Albert showing that I have fulfilled a specific Biology course? Transfer credits are not automatically applied toward a specific Biology course, but are applied toward the science MAP requirement or applied as general elective toward the 128 credits needed to graduate from CAS. Can I take a Biology course outside NYU? Yes, as long as the biology department has approved the course as being equivalent through a review of the course syllabus, and you have received the approval from the Dean's office. You MUST seek the approval from both the department and the Dean's office before you register into the non-NYU course. Retroactive approval will not be given .       How do undergraduate research credits work?       [ Direct link ]   There are two types of research credits that you can earn. Independent Study is for those doing research with a faculty member in the Biology department. Internship is for those doing research outside the department. Both types of research will require that you complete the appropriate application form (which you can get from the Undergraduate Administrative Aide in the Biology Department office on the 10th floor of the Silver Center, Room 1009), and submit the requested information to the department for approval. When can I register for research credits? Registering for research credits can only be for the Fall and/or Spring semester. You are responsible for submitting all requested supporting material several weeks before the beginning of the semester or during registration week. Can I use the research credits in place of the Lab Skills (At the Bench) requirement for the major? Yes, both Independent Study and Internship credits can be used to fulfill the Lab Skills course requirement for the major. The requirements for doing so are listed on the respective application form. Can I get research credits for research that I have already done? No, you cannot. Research credits cannot be approved retroactively for past research experience. You must be working on a research project when you apply for the research credits.       How does registration work for Biology majors and minors?       [ Direct link ]   Majors: Biology majors receive an email via BioNews, our listserv for majors, from the Undergraduate Administrative Aide which will indicate the dates and instructions for making appointments with your faculty adviser. Make sure to reach out as soon as possible to your advisor since many of them are very busy with teaching and research. Come to your meeting prepared. It is helpful to have a copy of your degree progress report and your unofficial transcript as well as a plan for the semester to discuss. You will also need to bring along a registration form found on our forms page . After your discussion with your adviser you will fill out the form and have your adviser sign it. Bring your completed and signed form to the Undergraduate Administrative Aide located in the Biology Department office on the 10th floor of the Silver Center, room 1009. She will see to it that you are cleared to register in Albert within 24 hours of receiving your form.  Minors: Biology minors all see the Assistant Director for Undergraduate Studies, Dr. Ignatius Tan, for advising except for Environmental Biology minors who all see Dr. Mary Killilea for advising.       I\u2019m graduating, what do I need to do?       [ Direct link ]   Biology majors in their Junior or Senior year should make sure all biology requirements have been meet ( checklist ). Majors should meet with their faculty adviser to finalize any courses or address concerns. We ask that all graduating seniors fill out the Exit Interview Form found on our forms page and submit to the Undergraduate Administrative Aide in the Biology Department office located on the 10th floor of the Silver Center before leaving NYU. Congratulations on your achievement!       What are the admissions requirements for attending NYU as a Biology major?       [ Direct link ]   All questions about admissions should be directed to the Admissions Office . The Biology department is not involved in admissions decisions. If you are a prospective student and seek information about the Biology major, most of your questions should be answered by looking under Undergraduate Program on this website.       What are the requirements for Honors in Biology?       [ Direct link ]   The requirements for Honors in Biology are the same as those for the Bachelor of Arts degree, plus: (a) a GPA of at least 3.65 overall and at least 3.65 in all science and math courses required for the major, (b) an additional Honors-level seminar in Biology, (c) at least one semester of 4-credit Independent Study or Internship that is a laboratory-based research project, (d) an additional 2-credit thesis-writing course (BIOL-UA 999) and (e) a written thesis and oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee. The application form , available at the Biology department office and on this website ( under Forms ), must be submitted by the beginning of the final semester.       Where can I get advice on being a pre-health student?       [ Direct link ]   The Biology Major Check Sheet (found under Forms on this website) outlines the standard four-year course plan for pre-med Biology majors. All pre-health students should discuss their plans with their Biology advisers, and should seek advising from the CAS Preprofessional Advising office .       Who can I contact if I have questions about the undergraduate program in Biology?       [ Direct link ]   Be sure to look through all the FAQs and the Undergraduate Program pages. If you still have questions about the Biology major and Biology undergraduate curriculum you should contact the Director of Undergradate Studies at biology.dugs@nyu.edu or see the Undergraduate Administrative Aide Biology department office. The office is located on the 10th Floor of the Silver Center in room 1009.       Why should I become a Biology major at NYU?       [ Direct link ]   The NYU Biology Department is vibrant, interactive and collegial, with unusually strong interactions between faculty and students. Our faculty members lead cutting-edge research programs and teach students from the introductory to the advanced level. Our courses guide students in developing a firm foundation of biological knowledge, as well as skills in critical reasoning, quantitative analysis and experimental methods. Introductory courses include labs and/or recitations, for a more personal experience that complements lectures. Upper-level courses are generally small and interactive. Students are exposed to the breadth of biological inquiry, from molecules to organisms to populations to ecosystems, and are encouraged to gain laboratory research experience through independent study or internship. Each Biology major is advised by a faculty member, who provides guidance on course selection and career preparation. Biology majors go on to pursue careers in the health professions, in scientific research, in teaching, in journalism and in a variety of other fields. Any student seeking a strong education in the life sciences will find a home in the NYU Biology Department.       Graduate       Do I need to obtain a Full-time Equivalency if I am taking less than 12 points in a specific semester?       [ Direct link ]   Masters students who are receiving certain kinds of loans or fellowships, as well as international students who are on an F-1 or J-1 visas need to be certified as a full-time student each semester. You are certified as full-time by either registering for 12 points or by obtaining a Full-time Equivalency when registered for less than 12 points but doing an activity such as working on a Masters qualifying paper/thesis or having a Teaching Adjunct position. You can contact the Graduate Coordinator to request that a Full-time Equivalency be posted.       General PhD Program Admissions Questions       [ Direct link ]   How do I apply for the Biology PhD program? Visit the graduate schools NYU GSAS Application Resource Center . Scroll down for more FAQ's. The Biology Department's deadline is December 1st. That includes letters of recommendation so please encourage your letter writers to send in their recommendations by the deadline. Should I call the Department to see if you received everything? No, instead please refer to the Supporting Materials Tracking System (SMTS) to see if GSAS has received and recorded the supporting materials for your application. If you are having technical issues, email gsas.admissions@nyu.edu and they will reply within 24-48 hours. Will my application be considered if my GRE or TOEFL scores are received after the deadline? Yes, all applications will be considered although complete applications are easier for us to evaluate. Then what happens? The Admissions Committee reviews applications in late December and students to be interviewed are notified at the end of December. We have 2, two-day Recruitment &amp; Interview events in January and February, where applicants get a chance to meet the faculty and our current PhD students, tour our newly-renovated Department, see the amazing facilities and experience downtown life in Greenwich Village. We also conduct interviews with students from overseas by phone or via an NYU faculty member traveling to that area. Applicants not selected for an interview will be reviewed for the M.S. in Biology Program. How do I apply to a lab? You apply to our program, not to a specific lab. You may have a specific lab or a few labs in mind when you apply, but all applications are read by the Admissions Committee to decide who to interview. It is a good idea to have several possible mentors in mind when you apply since all students spend 8-9 weeks in 3 different labs (rotations) during their first year before picking a mentor for their PhD studies. Are there minimum GPA, GRE and GRE TOEFL scores? We do not have specific cut-offs \u2013 instead we look at your whole application, including GPA, GREs, your personal statement, research experience and recommendation letters. The Graduate School recommends a minimum of 100 on the TOEFL Internet test or 600 for the paper-based test and we like this score to be considerably higher. What do you look for in an applicant? Many things! A good fit: Are you interested in the Biology that we study here? Commitment to research: Do you have research experience? A PhD requires commitment, patience and hard work \u2013 do you know what you are getting into? A strong academic background: Do you have good GPAs, GREs and are you well- grounded in Biology? Do you fund international students? All of our PhD students (domestic and international) receive a stipend. They are supported by a combination of MacCracken fellowship funds and research funds from their mentor for a five year award term. Awards also include full tuition and fees for the Ph.D. program, student health insurance, and a one-time $1,000 stipend for start-up expenses. How many students apply and how many do you admit? How many are international students? We receive about 250 applications each year and we have been aiming for a class of 12 students. Each year the number of international students varies, but sometimes as many as half of our students are from overseas. Do you admit in Spring? No. Our deadline is December 1st to start in the program the following Fall. What are the differences between the Center for Genomics &amp; Systems Biology, the Center for Developmental Genetics and the Biology Department? Where should I apply? These are two of the major areas of concentration within the Biology Department and many faculty are in both Centers. All students apply to the Biology Department. What is the difference between the Biology Department and the Center for Neural Science? These are 2 separate Departments at NYU with separate PhD programs. Although some faculty have joint appointments in both Departments, you should look carefully to see which Professors you are likely to want to work with and where they have their primary appointment. Some of the Biology Department Professors with strong interests in Neurobiology are Justin Blau , Richard Borowsky , Claude Desplan , Esteban Mazzoni , and Dan Tranchina . Should I apply to NYU Biology or the Sackler program? Again these are separate PhD programs \u2013 Biology is at the downtown campus, while the Sackler program is based at NYU\u2019s School of Medicine. Many Biology and Medical School faculty are in the Developmental Genetics (DG) program, co-teach a course together to students from both locations and run an NIH Training grant together. Students entering this track in Biology can spend 1 rotation at the Medical School, but we find it usually works best if students from Biology stay in Biology for their PhD. So which program should you choose? The program where the faculty\u2019s interests are closest to your own interests. Where should I look for financial aid information, including GSAS tuition and fees? The GSAS website has a Financial Aid section, http://gsas.nyu.edu/page.financialaid, which provides helpful information including a Financing Graduate Education (PDF) and Tuition &amp; Fees page. Always check your Spam or Junk folder for correspondence from the schools you have applied to: an important email may accidentally be identified as \"unsolicited email\" by your spam filter.        How do grades below a B affect my GPA?       [ Direct link ]   GSAS requires students to maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher and successfully complete 66 percent of points attempted at NYU. A grade below a B, but not a failing grade, may lower a GPA to below a 3.0, depending on the other grades a student has received. A letter grade of \u201dF\u201d damages the GPA considerably since a 0 is factored into the GPA; however, a grade of \u201cW\u201d (Withdraw) does not affect the GPA. Withdrawal from a course is possible up to 24 hours before the final exam. If the student\u2019s GPA falls below a 3.0, the Department is required to prepare an Academic Probation letter which will be given to the student; the letter will provide details regarding the length of time the student has to raise his/her GPA to a 3.0. A copy of the letter must be provided by the Department to the GSAS Office of Academic and Student Affairs.       How do I apply for a grad student Biology travel grant?       [ Direct link ]   A significant component of the professional development of graduate students is attendance at and participation in major scientific meetings in their fields. The department strongly encourages students to report their findings at such meetings and offers travel funds to help defray the cost of attendance. GSAS also provides travel funds, as well as travel grants to support longer visits to other institutions to carry out collaborative research or to learn new techniques. Many of the professional scientific organizations also offer travel fellowships for students. Applications for any of these travel grants should be made as early as possible, generally at the beginning of the academic year but no later than 2 months in advance, as funds are often limited and awards are made competitively. To apply for a Student Travel Grant from the Department of Biology, make sure you meet the eligibility requirements. Eligibility  Must be a PhD or MS student in good standing in the Department of Biology. Must be presenting a poster or giving a talk at the meeting. Travel grants are limited to $500 maximum. You must have funds to cover any remaining expenses (either PI funds or personal funds). Must present you poster at the annual Non-Retreating Retreat (PhD students) or annual MS Poster Session (MS students).  Procedure  Fill out the application form .   Send the completed application via email to the Director of   Graduate Studies, either for the PhD Program (justin.blau@nyu.edu) or the MS   Program (chris.rushlow@nyu.edu), for approval. Approval is subject to available funds. You will be notified if your application has been approved. The award is reimbursement based, so once you have attended the meeting you must retain all your receipts/boarding passes and will submit up to $500 worth of reimbursement requests. This can include airfare or train tickets, hotel or accommodation costs, and registration fees. Reimbursements are submitted via AP Workflow. If you do not have access to AP Workflow, please contact the Budget Assistant to set up your account in the system. If your PI has agreed to cover any additional costs you can request them at the same time in the same AP Workflow transaction (you will need to ask your PI for a chartfield number).        How do I apply for a Master\u2019s Research Grant?       [ Direct link ]   The Biology Department has a program that provides research grants to Master's students doing research with Biology faculty. This program aims to provide opportunities for the professional development of Master\u2019s students seeking careers in biomedical research through successful experiments and mentoring in the lab by Biology Department faculty. Students interested in applying for a Biology Masters Research Grant, who meet the eligibility requirements, should discuss the application with their faculty mentor prior to the application due date. Eligibility :   The applicant must be an active student in good standing taking Lab Molecular III or IV   (BIOL-GA.1124, 1125) or Research (BIOL-GA.3303, 3304) in order to apply.   The student must have successfully completed 1 semester of coursework.   The student must be conducting their research with a faculty member in the Department of Biology.  Process: All application materials are submitted to the Graduate Administrative Aide by the first week of January for a spring semester grant, the first week of June for a summer semester grant, or the last week of September for a fall semester grant. A committee will review all applications and award the grants. The Graduate Administrative Aide will notify the faculty member and the MS student if they have won an award and an official award letter will be issued to the MS student. The funds are transferred directly to the faculty sponsor in support of the project. No funds are paid directly to the student. Application Materials:  1 page project proposal (include specific aims). This is to be written by the student with help from the faculty sponsor.   An unofficial transcript   A budget not exceeding $1,500   A letter of support from the faculty mentor clearly state that   they recommend the student receive the grant and that you are prepared   to supervise and mentor the student throughout the project. Limitations : About 10 grants are award each year. Each MS student is limited to two Biology Masters Research Grant during the course of their study.       How do I apply for graduation?       [ Direct link ]   You apply for graduation on ALBERT; Graduation information is available on the Registrar's website . Please keep in mind that you must apply for graduation about three months before you expect to graduate (see the Graduation Deadlines chart for graduation application periods). After you have applied for graduation, the Office of the University Registrar, Graduation Services, will mail a Check Sheet to your mailing address (please be sure that your address is up to date on ALBERT) approximately one month before graduation. The Check Sheet is only for your information; the Department will inform Graduation Services by the deadline on the Check Sheet that you are either \u201celigible to graduate\u201d (you have completed the 36 points and research paper/thesis for your degree) or \u201cnot ready to graduate.\u201d       How do I apply for transfer credit?       [ Direct link ]   Transfer credit should be requested within the first academic year of attendance as a matriculant. Students requesting transfer credit should send an email to the Director of Graduate Studies (for the MS Program, chris.rushlow@nyu.edu, or for the PhD Program, justin.blau@nyu.edu); a transcript and course description should be attached to the request (note: a grade below B is not eligible for transfer).       How do I find a research opportunity? (Masters Student)       [ Direct link ]   Research is an important part of your Master\u2019s education at New York University and as such you are probably very interested in finding a good lab to complete the research portion of your degree. The Biology Department faculty (as well as other faculty around NYU and outside) are very much interested in accepting qualified MS students in their labs. However, they receive many emails each day asking for research positions. Below are some suggestions that may help you be more effective as you inquire about research opportunities. The most important tip we can give it to treat this process professionally! Being offered a research position is indeed a privilege not a guarantee. Send the faculty member an original email (no form letters please) explaining who you are. Let them know you are a Master\u2019s student in the Department of Biology and that you are interested in working on a research project in their lab, and would like to meet with them to discuss this prospect. Next outline WHY are you are interested in their particular lab and their particular research. Don\u2019t simply say that you want to do research! Do a little background work. Look at the faculty member\u2019s webpage (http://biology.as.nyu.edu/page/faculty). Read their research statement, and possibly some of their recent publications. Talk to other MS students in their lab if you can. Explain in the email why you want to do research with them. You could mention that you found a certain pub very interesting, and that is why you would like to work on a project in their lab. Then cover some logistics. Mention that you plan to take Research credits, and that you would like to write your MS thesis on your laboratory results under his/her mentorship. If you have had previous research experience, mention the specific type of projects and/or techniques you have performed. You may also want to indicate your current NYU GPA and your undergrad GPA. Always attach a copy of your master\u2019s program transcript (an unofficial copy is fine) or your undergrad transcript if you are a new MS student. Always attach a resume to the email as well and be sure it includes any past research experience. Follow up might include a phone call, or a phone message indicating that you recently sent an email to inquire about the possibility of a research position as a Master\u2019s student in the Biology department, and were following up on that email. If in the event that there are no available positions in the labs you contacted, please see the Director of Graduate Studies, Master Program about other possibilities.       How do I find financial aid information, including GSAS tuition and fees, for this year?       [ Direct link ]   The GSAS website has a Financial Aid section, http://gsas.nyu.edu/page.financialaid , which provides helpful information including a Financing Graduate Education (PDF) and Tuition &amp; Fees page.       How do I format my Masters Thesis/Qualifying Research Paper?       [ Direct link ]   Please refer to our guidelines on writing your Masters Qualifying Research Paper (commonly called a Thesis) located here .       How do I get a Teaching Adjunct (TA) position in Biology?       [ Direct link ]   Masters Students: There are a limited number of Teaching Adjunct (TA) positions available each semester in the Department of Biology and in the Morris Academic Plan (MAP). Students are contacted 3 times a year with an invitation to apply. May for assignments in the coming fall and spring and April for assignments in the coming summer session. For full information please see our Teaching Adjunct information page . PhD Students: There are also teaching opportunities available to 1st through 5th year students with an emphasis on teaching in the first two years of study. The details of assignments available and the recruitment process are presented at a PhD student town hall meeting each spring.       How do I get my poster printed in the Biology office?       [ Direct link ]   Email your poster to fas.bio.computing@nyu.edu in one of the following formats: PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Adobe Illustrator. We stock 36 inch wide HP Semi-Gloss paper and recommend setting the document dimensions to 36 x 48 inches with 0 inch margins when creating your poster. Borderless prints are only available for 36 x 48 inch documents. Keep important text or images at least 6 millimeters from the poster's edge since the printer automatically enlarges the poster slightly in order to print over the edges of the paper. Posters are not waterproof. We recommend bringing a poster tube or plastic bag when rain is expected. Printing of draft copies and reprints is strongly discouraged. If you are participating in the annual Undergraduate Research Conference, MS poster session or the annual Non-retreating Retreat, please allow plenty of time to print your poster. The printer gets backlogged before these events.          How do I maintain my matriculation each Fall and Spring semester?       [ Direct link ]   GSAS students must maintain continuous enrollment each fall and spring semester in their programs from the time of matriculation until the degree is awarded, even if they are not planning to take a course during a specific semester or have completed their degree requirements and are working on their MS research paper/thesis. There are three ways to maintain enrollment in a degree program: Registering for at least one credit; Enrolling in Maintenance of Matriculation (MAINT-GA 4747), if the points for the degree have been completed and you are working on your MS research paper/thesis (see 5.2 of the GSAS Manual ); Taking an approved leave of absence (see 5.4 of the GSAS Manual ).       How do I prepare to register for classes?       [ Direct link ]   Before you register for your classes on ALBERT, you should check the semester course offerings to be sure you have the course prerequisites; if a course requires Permission of the Instructor, you must obtain the instructor\u2019s permission before registering. All graduate biology (BIOL-GA) courses require use of a permission code. Students should contact the Coordinator of Student Advisement for permission codes, either via email or in-person; a permission code is to be used only by the person requesting the code and can only be used once.       How do I submit a reimbursement or advance?       [ Direct link ]   If you have paid out-of-pocket for business related expenses such as supplies or travel you can seek reimbursement. All faculty, grad students and researchers are required to process their own reimbursement requests through AP workflow. New employees are added to the system as a part of the on-boarding process. However if you find you do not have access, please contact biology.orders@nyu.edu to be added to the system. To learn how to use AP Workflow , look in the iLearn channel of NYU Home (under the work tab). We have also created a quick guide to help you with the process. If you run into trouble please contact the Budget Assistant for help. All expenses, regardless of the manner of purchase, must support the missions of the university in addition to all externally funded project policies used to cover the costs.         Please consider the following unallowable reimbursement claims before purchasing a business expense out of pocket:       Any one item claimed for reimbursement, deemed as non-travel and non-meal, cannot exceed $1,000. Items that are $1000 or over must have pre-approved by the department before purchase and must be processed through the Purchasing Department. Have your lab designee place the order or submit an order request form through the dept.      Third party reimbursements are not allowable. Under no circumstances can a person claim reimbursement for an expense paid out-of-pocket by another person. The original payee of the expense must file for reimbursement directly to the university. This policy includes non-university affiliates. This means PIs can't buy plane tickets for their whole lab to go to a conference and get reimbursed for everyone's expenses. Each person must make their own purchases and seek their own reimbursement.      Office Supplies cannot be claimed as a reimbursement. These orders must be routed through the dept for prior approval and purchase unless you are using faculty unrestricted funds.      For business travel that requires air travel, flights must be performed by a US flag carrier in compliance with the Fly America Act. If you qualify for an exemption it must be well documented at the time of purchase. Contact the Budget Assistant for more details.         Submitting Your Reimbursement through AP Workflow       Select the correct approval path. If you are unsure which path to use please contact the Budget Assistant, or the Financial Analyst.      Indicate yourself as the contact.      Double check that the home address selected is current as the system does not purge outdated addresses and new addresses populate the bottom of the list and not the top.      These are the most common account codes you will encounter. Insert into the first 5 digits of the chartfield section:            Travel \u2013 Domestic 65510    Travel \u2013 Foreign 65520    Travel \u2013 Local (no overnight stay) 65550    Dinner/Food (include tax &amp; tip) 65182    Alcohol (must ALWAYS be separated out from any food charge) 65183    Lab Supplies/Small lab equipment &lt;$3,000 63210    Equipment costing &gt;$3,000 62100    Office Supplies 63110    Property or Equipment Repair 64305          Notes:      Alcohol must always be separated out of a meal/food receipt and charged to its own line under account code 65183. If no alcohol was charged during a meal, it is helpful to write \"No alcohol purchased\" on your receipt.      If you are unsure about what chartfield to use, first talk to your PI. Then contact the Budget Assistant or the Financial Analyst for help.      *Remember that alcohol, office supplies, membership fees (even when it makes meeting registration cheaper), journal subscriptions or grant writing costs are never allowed on federal projects.          You will attach an electronic copy of all supporting documentation on the preview page. As a general rule of thumb, all receipts must be itemized, show the total cost of purchase, and proof of payment. If any information is missing, then the documentation is considered insufficient and you will need to include a signed \u201c missing/inadequate doc report \u201d. You will need a missing/inadequate doc report to accompany each insufficient document. The form must be included along with the insufficient documentation, it cannot replace it.      Your reimbursement request will get routed to the Budget Assistant for review before it is sent to the next level of approval. If there are any issues, he/she will contact you with the necessary corrections.         Additional Instructions for Travel Reimbursements       Register your travel through NYU Traveler whenever possible. If you are traveling with undergraduate students, using NYU Traveler is required.      You must include your boarding passes for reimbursement so be sure to retain them during your travel.    The business purpose of your trip must be explicitly stated. If it is not clear from your documentation you must upload a statement that explains the reason you took the trip and how it related to working at NYU. Additionally, you must include proof that you attended the business reason for the travel (i.e. meeting program, name tag, letter of attendance from the organization, etc.).      Meals can be submitted as one of two methods (but cannot be a combination).      Submit as Receipts: There is no maximum amount on daily claims if submitting receipts. Each meal receipt must be itemized.      Submit as Per Diem: You can claim up to $50/day for domestic travel. The first and last days of travel must be prorated . Foreign travel has different per diem rates depending on the site. Refer to Office of Allowances site for rates under the \u201cM &amp; IE Rate\u201d column.               Travel Advances:      Travel reimbursements can only be submitted within 30 days once you have returned and the trip is completed. You may request an advance beforehand, which will require an extra reconciliation step, which falls under the responsibility of the requester to do, once the trip is completed. Any un-reconciled advances will be considered taxable income as the university will assume that the travel was never executed. If advances are left outstanding, then AP will reject any future advance requests. To close out an advance, you will create a reimbursement request. The reimbursement will follow the same guidelines explained above, which will include the details and amounts of the charges claimed in the advance and you may include any other expenses that were incurred during the travel. On the main page you will indicate the advance amount in the \u201cInvoices Information\u201d section. Find the correct advance in the drop down labeled, \u201cOutstanding Advances\u201d. Once you have selected the advance, the advance amount will automatically deduct from the \u201cGrand Total\u201d line in the \u201cExpense/Account Detail Information\u201d section. The grand total will be $0, unless you included expenses that were not included in the advance, then the grand total will reflect the total amount of the additional expenses. Notes : For reimbursements for departmental expenses (anything covered by department funds instead of lab funds) you must first contact one of the Department Administrators who will review the expense and either provide you with a chartfield, or handle the reimbursement for you, whichever is appropriate for the situation.

[ Direct link ]   The Department of Biology has an orientation for new students during the first week of the Fall semester; incoming MS students will be sent an invitation via email in August. The Director of the MS Biology program will provide information regarding the MS program and answer questions at this event. GSAS also has a New Student Orientation, for students accepted for the Fall and Spring semesters; GSAS New Student Orientation Series information is available here . The GSAS New Student Checklist provides helpful information, specifically #2, Contact Your Academic Department, and #9, Register for Classes.       I'm applying for or have a pre or postdoctoral fellowship. What do I need to know?       [ Direct link ]   Fellowship proposals require the same internal approvals as faculty proposals. Getting institutional signatures take time so please notify the Grants Administrator as soon as possible once you have decided to apply for a fellowship. Please review the NYU Office of Sponsored Program\u2019s proposal submission policies. When you email the Grants Administrator please include a link to the funding opportunity in the email and   prepare the following for the a brief meeting: Project Title Project Start and End Dates Budget: amount to request and preliminary budget breakdown ideas: Personnel (Co-Investigators, postdocs, graduate students, consultants, subcontractors) Equipment Supplies Travel Other Letters of Support or Collaboration Human or animal subject approvals, if applicable Please note that most proposals are now submitted electronically. You may need to register for a username prior to submission. NYU uses Cayuse 424 and Cayuse SP for submission and administration of proposals and awards, which also requires user registration. Details on how to   register for each of these user profiles can be founds here .   Please do not wait until the last minute to register. If you are   registered already but with a previous institution you must change your   affiliate to NYU. Does a fellowship affect my NYU benefits as a postdoc? When you are awarded a fellowship, your NYU payroll code will change from 103 (Post Doctoral Associate) to 542/103 (Post Doctoral Fellow). Depending on the funding agency, your mentor/sponsor (lab PI) may be required to re-appoint you for a minimum amount that must be charged to his or her unrestricted account. Typically, this is not required for NIH fellowships (internal) but is required for NSF, HFSP &amp; EMBO (external). Regardless of the agency providing the stipend, please note that the only benefits you will continue to receive are employee medical and dental . Vision, tuition remission, commuter benefits, retirement, vacation and sick time accruals etc. no longer apply. Please also note that to receive paid bonding leave you must be an employee for 2 consecutive years and time as a fellow will not be counted and may reset your 2 year clock. The department strongly advises you to consult with the Benefits Office regarding the most current policy for a code 103 employee converting to a code 542/103 employee. The Benefits office can be reached at benefits@nyu.edu or 212-998-1270. It can take a month for your payroll code to change within University payroll systems. Please contact the Financial Analyst as soon as you receive the award to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. When you become a code 542/103 your tax status may also change. Please contact NYU payroll at AskPeopleLink@nyu.edu or 212-992-5465 for the most up to date information. What forms or trainings do I need?  FORMS 1.

[ Direct link ]   The GSAS Convocation and the All-University Commencement are held once each year, in May. September and January degree recipients and May degree candidates are sent a GSAS Convocation email invitation from the Graduate School and an All-University Commencement invitation by mail from the Commencement Office by the third week in March.  Please refer to the GSAS Convocation Frequently Asked Questions at http://convocation.gsas.nyu.edu/page/faq for additional information.       What is Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training? Do I have to attend?       [ Direct link ]   According to NIH notice NOT-OD-10-019, the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is defined as the practice of scientific investigation with integrity. It involves the awareness and application of established professional norms and ethical principles in the performance of all activities related to scientific research. Therefore, instruction in responsible conduct of research is an integral part of all research training programs. NSF considers education in RCR essential in the preparation of future scientists and engineers. You may be required to have RCR certification, depending on which agency funds the research project you work on. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training is required for:    Any undergraduate student, graduate student, or postdoctoral researcher supported by NSF to conduct research on a project whose proposal was submitted on or after January 4, 2010 Any NIH T, F or K awardee All first or second year PhD candidate in the Biology Department   Categories (A) and (B) is required under the terms of your PI's/your grant agreement. Category (C) is recommended as part of your PhD training. Attendance records must be kept for departmental, University, and Federal compliance. Please send a copy of your certificate to the Biology Grants admin so it can be added to your file. Currently for Biology, this training is achieved through a combination of the three lecture series below:  1. Center for Neural Science (CNS)  7 sessions held once a year in the Spring semester Historically Thursdays 6:30pm-8:30pm (Feb \u2013 May), Meyer Building http://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/emergsci/ 2. Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA)  2 sessions in the Fall semester which are repeated in the Spring semester historically Fridays 9:00am-11:00am , Kimmel Center http://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/training-and-certification/rcrtraining.html 3. University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (UCAIHS) 1 session offered twice in the Fall semester which is repeated in the Spring historically Thursdays 4:00pm-6:00pm, 665 Broadway http://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/getting-started-withyourresearch/human-subjects-research/ucaihs-trainings.html The seven (7) CNS sessions are enough to fulfill the RCR requirement. You DO NOT have to take the two (2) OPA sessions and one (1) UCAIHS session in addition to the CNS sessions. However, if you miss one of the CNS sessions you can make it up with the corresponding OPA or UCAIHS course and still fulfill the requirement (see below). Questions? email sr147@nyu.edu (Suzan Runko, Biology Grants Administrator). CNS sessions: Research Misconduct and Conflict of Interest (equivalent to OPA #1) Ethical Considerations in Research with Human Subjects (equivalent to UCAIHS #1) Publication practice (equivalent to OPA #2) Ethical considerations animal Data acquisition, Management, Sharing &amp; Ownership Survival skills for a career in research Mentor/Trainee Responsibilities, and Collaboration in Science OPA sessions: Research Misconduct/Conflict of Interest (equivalent to CNS #1) Introduction to Responsible Conduct of Research; Publication &amp; Authorship (equivalent to CNS #3) UCAIHS session: IRB Made Easy (equivalent to CNS #2)       Where should I look for graduate academic policies and procedures information?       [ Direct link ]   The Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) has an Academic Policies and Procedures Manual on their web site . Graduate students should be familiar with the academic policies and procedures and consult the manual as needed throughout their graduate career for rules regarding, for example, academic standing and grades, transfer credit, and maintaining matriculation.       Faculty       How do I get my grant proposal submitted?       [ Direct link ]   Every proposal application requires institutional approval (Department Head, Dean, and Office of Sponsored Programs). The Grants Administrator is here to assist in developing your proposal from start to finish. Institutional approval forms should be submitted at least 10 days prior to proposal deadline. Please review the NYU Office of Sponsored Program\u2019s proposal submission policies. To begin the process please email the Grants Administrator as soon as you have decided to apply for a funding opportunity and schedule a time to meet. Please include a link to the funding opportunity in the email and prepare the following for the meeting: Project Title Project Start and End Dates Budget: amount to request and preliminary budget breakdown ideas: Personnel (Co-Investigators, postdocs, graduate students, consultants, subcontractors) Equipment Supplies Travel Other Letters of Support or Collaboration Human or animal subject approvals, if applicable Please note that most proposals are now submitted electronically. NIH and NSF require PIs to register for a username prior to submission. NYU uses Cayuse 424 and Cayuse SP for submission and administration of proposals and awards, which also requires user registration. Details on how to register for each of these user profiles can be founds here . Please do not wait until the last minute to register. If you are registered already but with a previous institution you must change your affiliate to NYU.       How do I get my MTA (Materials Transfer Agreement) processed and signed by NYU?       [ Direct link ]   Many times when requesting research materials from another educational institution or company you will be asked to sign a Material Transfer Agreement or MTA. All MTAs, no matter how simple, have to be processed through NYU\u2019s legal channels. Fill out the MTA as best you can. Please make sure to list the PI as the user since the MTA will stay with the lab no matter how long a particular researcher will be at NYU. Fill out the required internal MRD form . Submit MTA and MRD as a signed hard copy and an unsigned electronic form to the Department Administrator who will maintain a copy in the Biology office and forward to our contacts in the Office of the Industrial Liaison. The Office of the Industrial Liaison does any negotiating with the supplier and will be in contact with you if they have additional questions. They will send you and the supplier a fully executed copy of the MTA. Note: The best way to expedite the process is make sure the MRD form is filled out quickly and forwarded along with the MTA. Many companies automatically send the MTA to the Office of the Industrial Liaison, but without the internal MRD form nothing will happen and the process will be delayed.       How do I get my poster printed in the Biology office?       [ Direct link ]   Email your poster to fas.bio.computing@nyu.edu in one of the following formats: PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Adobe Illustrator. We stock 36 inch wide HP Semi-Gloss paper and recommend setting the document dimensions to 36 x 48 inches with 0 inch margins when creating your poster. Borderless prints are only available for 36 x 48 inch documents. Keep important text or images at least 6 millimeters from the poster's edge since the printer automatically enlarges the poster slightly in order to print over the edges of the paper. Posters are not waterproof. We recommend bringing a poster tube or plastic bag when rain is expected. Printing of draft copies and reprints is strongly discouraged. If you are participating in the annual Undergraduate Research Conference, MS poster session or the annual Non-retreating Retreat, please allow plenty of time to print your poster. The printer gets backlogged before these events.          How do I get news/events onto the Department plasma screens or website?       [ Direct link ]   The department maintains plasma screen displays on almost every floor of the department to display news and information. We also maintain news and events features on our website. We encourage faculty to share their news and events with the Biology community. Please send your Department Administrator an email with the following information: A title for the news or event. Required. At least 1 relevant image. Required. A 1-3 sentence teaser or summary describing the news or event. Required. A longer abstract or paragraph. This will display under the \"read more\" link for web spotlights. Optional. In general news and events will be displayed on both the plasma screens and the website. You can indicate in your email if you would like something different.  NOTES:  Feel free to alert us to the news of your fellow faculty members. We will reach out to them for the needed information. Keep in mind that several of the plasma screen displays are in public places so please do not include any information that should be kept internal. Event announcements are only permitted for those events sponsored by the Department or those where a faculty member is heavily involved (i.e. an organizer). Plasma screen information must be submitted by noon the Friday before you would like for the slide to go live. If your news warrants a legitimate press release, James Devitt covers press releases for the Department of Biology. You can request a press release using the following steps: Contact James as soon as the paper or grant is accepted and send him a copy (even a draft is fine) as an MSWord .doc file. Make sure to include your contact information. Be prepared to speak to James by phone for 15-20 minutes to discuss your findings. He will send you a draft of the release for your edits and/or approval. The release goes out at or around the embargo date. You may be reluctant to send James the information before there is an embargo date established or before you have a final proof of your paper but this is a mistake.

[ Direct link ]   If you have paid out-of-pocket for business related expenses such as supplies or travel you can seek reimbursement. All faculty, grad students and researchers are required to process their own reimbursement requests through AP workflow. New employees are added to the system as a part of the on-boarding process. However if you find you do not have access, please contact biology.orders@nyu.edu to be added to the system. To learn how to use AP Workflow , look in the iLearn channel of NYU Home (under the work tab). We have also created a quick guide to help you with the process. If you run into trouble please contact the Budget Assistant for help. All expenses, regardless of the manner of purchase, must support the missions of the university in addition to all externally funded project policies used to cover the costs.         Please consider the following unallowable reimbursement claims before purchasing a business expense out of pocket:       Any one item claimed for reimbursement, deemed as non-travel and non-meal, cannot exceed $1,000. Items that are $1000 or over must have pre-approved by the department before purchase and must be processed through the Purchasing Department. Have your lab designee place the order or submit an order request form through the dept.      Third party reimbursements are not allowable. Under no circumstances can a person claim reimbursement for an expense paid out-of-pocket by another person. The original payee of the expense must file for reimbursement directly to the university. This policy includes non-university affiliates. This means PIs can't buy plane tickets for their whole lab to go to a conference and get reimbursed for everyone's expenses. Each person must make their own purchases and seek their own reimbursement.      Office Supplies cannot be claimed as a reimbursement. These orders must be routed through the dept for prior approval and purchase unless you are using faculty unrestricted funds.      For business travel that requires air travel, flights must be performed by a US flag carrier in compliance with the Fly America Act. If you qualify for an exemption it must be well documented at the time of purchase. Contact the Budget Assistant for more details.         Submitting Your Reimbursement through AP Workflow       Select the correct approval path. If you are unsure which path to use please contact the Budget Assistant, or the Financial Analyst.      Indicate yourself as the contact.      Double check that the home address selected is current as the system does not purge outdated addresses and new addresses populate the bottom of the list and not the top.      These are the most common account codes you will encounter. Insert into the first 5 digits of the chartfield section:            Travel \u2013 Domestic 65510    Travel \u2013 Foreign 65520    Travel \u2013 Local (no overnight stay) 65550    Dinner/Food (include tax &amp; tip) 65182    Alcohol (must ALWAYS be separated out from any food charge) 65183    Lab Supplies/Small lab equipment &lt;$3,000 63210    Equipment costing &gt;$3,000 62100    Office Supplies 63110    Property or Equipment Repair 64305          Notes:      Alcohol must always be separated out of a meal/food receipt and charged to its own line under account code 65183. If no alcohol was charged during a meal, it is helpful to write \"No alcohol purchased\" on your receipt.      If you are unsure about what chartfield to use, first talk to your PI. Then contact the Budget Assistant or the Financial Analyst for help.      *Remember that alcohol, office supplies, membership fees (even when it makes meeting registration cheaper), journal subscriptions or grant writing costs are never allowed on federal projects.          You will attach an electronic copy of all supporting documentation on the preview page. As a general rule of thumb, all receipts must be itemized, show the total cost of purchase, and proof of payment. If any information is missing, then the documentation is considered insufficient and you will need to include a signed \u201c missing/inadequate doc report \u201d. You will need a missing/inadequate doc report to accompany each insufficient document. The form must be included along with the insufficient documentation, it cannot replace it.      Your reimbursement request will get routed to the Budget Assistant for review before it is sent to the next level of approval. If there are any issues, he/she will contact you with the necessary corrections.         Additional Instructions for Travel Reimbursements       Register your travel through NYU Traveler whenever possible. If you are traveling with undergraduate students, using NYU Traveler is required.      You must include your boarding passes for reimbursement so be sure to retain them during your travel.    The business purpose of your trip must be explicitly stated. If it is not clear from your documentation you must upload a statement that explains the reason you took the trip and how it related to working at NYU. Additionally, you must include proof that you attended the business reason for the travel (i.e. meeting program, name tag, letter of attendance from the organization, etc.).      Meals can be submitted as one of two methods (but cannot be a combination).      Submit as Receipts: There is no maximum amount on daily claims if submitting receipts. Each meal receipt must be itemized.      Submit as Per Diem: You can claim up to $50/day for domestic travel. The first and last days of travel must be prorated . Foreign travel has different per diem rates depending on the site. Refer to Office of Allowances site for rates under the \u201cM &amp; IE Rate\u201d column.               Travel Advances:      Travel reimbursements can only be submitted within 30 days once you have returned and the trip is completed. You may request an advance beforehand, which will require an extra reconciliation step, which falls under the responsibility of the requester to do, once the trip is completed. Any un-reconciled advances will be considered taxable income as the university will assume that the travel was never executed. If advances are left outstanding, then AP will reject any future advance requests. To close out an advance, you will create a reimbursement request. The reimbursement will follow the same guidelines explained above, which will include the details and amounts of the charges claimed in the advance and you may include any other expenses that were incurred during the travel. On the main page you will indicate the advance amount in the \u201cInvoices Information\u201d section. Find the correct advance in the drop down labeled, \u201cOutstanding Advances\u201d. Once you have selected the advance, the advance amount will automatically deduct from the \u201cGrand Total\u201d line in the \u201cExpense/Account Detail Information\u201d section. The grand total will be $0, unless you included expenses that were not included in the advance, then the grand total will reflect the total amount of the additional expenses. Notes : For reimbursements for departmental expenses (anything covered by department funds instead of lab funds) you must first contact one of the Department Administrators who will review the expense and either provide you with a chartfield, or handle the reimbursement for you, whichever is appropriate for the situation.

Resources for New Faculty       [ Direct link ]   How to relocate yourself and your lab to NYU Personal Belongings/Residence: The Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS) covers personal relocation costs for all new tenured and tenure track faculty. This includes the move of your personal residence/belongings. 1. Review the FAS moving policy found here: http://as.nyu.edu/object/aboutas.pp.assocdean.recuitment.html#movingpolicy 2. Contact a vendor on the NYU approved moving company list and request an estimate. The list is found here: http://www.purch.nyu.edu/sjkweb/suppliers.cfm?MasterID=22 Note: The Department of Biology has had great service on lab moves from Ace moving and HERS (Higher Education Relocations Services). Their coordinator Helen McNeece is truly excellent. Their website to initiate a move: http://higheredrelo.com/customers/nyu.htm 3. Once you have an estimate forward it to The Coordinator of Faculty Advancement, Rafael Acevedo Jr, 212-998-8067, rafael.acevedo@nyu.edu. He will make sure the vendor is approved by the purchasing department and put in the purchase order requisition request. This office will also cover your personal relocation costs such as plane tickets or train tickets. Lab Moves: Laboratory moves are not generally covered by FAS and instead must be funded through your start-up package. 1. Contact a vendor on the approved moving company list and request and estimate. The list is found here: http://www.purch.nyu.edu/sjkweb/suppliers.cfm?MasterID=22 . Since your lab move will be handled separately from your personal belongings, please request a separate estimate for each portion. Note: The Department of Biology has had great service on lab moves from Ace moving and HERS (Higher Education Relocations Services). Their coordinator Helen McNeece is truly excellent. Their website to initiate a move: http://higheredrelo.com/customers/nyu.htm 2. Once you have an estimate forward it to the Department Budget Assistant who will make sure the vendor is approved by the purchasing department and put in the purchase order requisition request. 3. If your move is minor and can be accomplished through shipping a few boxes via UPS or FedEx, please cover this cost out of pocket, obtain an invoice or receipt and submit it to the Budget Assistant for reimbursement from your start-up account. Lab Personnel: FAS does not cover moving costs for your lab personnel. If you would like to cover their moves using your start-up funds you are welcome to do so. Follow the steps above for lab moves as this will be handled through the Department.

[ Direct link ]   The Biology finance team is here to assist you in managing your grant. The Grants Administrator (GA) helps you prepare your grant proposal and once it is awarded will setup the award and any subcontracts in the NYU system. This includes the generation of a chartfield, initial budget upload, subaward agreement and purchase order. The GA also coordinates all annual progress reports and prior approval request. This includes NIH eSNAPs, no cost extensions and changes in committed effort. The GA will also help with the closure of the grant when it ends. The Financial Analyst (FA) will is your post award manager performing regular cost analysis, budget projections, personnel management and will coordinate financial reports with Sponsored Programs Administration (SPA) including helping you with any audits. The FA will also coordinate time and effort reporting for the Fall, Spring and Summer time periods and provide you with any training you need. The FA also manages your summer salary paperwork and ensures you are not overcommitted. The Budget Assistant (BA) will process non iBuy orders and reconcile your OTPS (other than personnel costs) while assisting the FA. The Chair and the Director of Administration are also available to help you troubleshoot or navigate unforseen issues with your awards. It is important that you familiarize yourself with grant spending restrictions. Visit the SPA handbook site (coming soon) and read the Biology faculty handbook for tips on managing your award and avoiding unallowable charges. The handbook can be found the Department server in the Faculty folder or in the secure part of our forms page .       Research Staff       Does a fellowship affect my NYU benefits as a postdoc?       [ Direct link ]   When   you are awarded a fellowship, your NYU payroll code will change from   103 (Post Doctoral Associate) to 542/103 (Post Doctoral Fellow).   Depending on the funding agency, your mentor/sponsor (lab PI) may be   required to re-appoint you for a minimum amount that must be charged to   his or her unrestricted account. Typically, this is not required for NIH   fellowships (internal) but is required for NSF, HFSP &amp; EMBO   (external). Regardless of the agency providing the stipend, please note that the only benefits you will continue to receive are employee medical and dental .   Vision, tuition remission, commuter benefits, retirement, vacation and   sick time accruals etc. no longer apply. Please also note that to   receive paid bonding leave you must be an employee for 2 consecutive    years and time as a fellow will not be counted and may reset your 2   year clock. The department strongly advises you to consult with the   Benefits Office regarding the most current policy for a code 103   employee converting to a code 542/103 employee. The Benefits office can   be reached at benefits@nyu.edu or 212-998-1270. It can take a   month for your payroll code to change within University payroll   systems. Please contact the Financial Analyst as soon as you receive   the award to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. When you become a code 542/103 your tax status may also change. Please contact NYU payroll at AskPeopleLink@nyu.edu or 212-992-5465 for the most up to date information.       How do I extend my current visa?       [ Direct link ]   Your PI must request an extension on your behalf by contacting the Department Administrator to initiate the process. If you are asking for an extension on a J-1 Visa, please initiate the process at least 2-3 months in advance. If the extension is for an H1B Visa, please initiate the process at least 6 months in advance.       How do I get my MTA (Materials Transfer Agreement) processed and signed by NYU?       [ Direct link ]   Many times when requesting research materials from another educational institution or company you will be asked to sign a Material Transfer Agreement or MTA. All MTAs, no matter how simple, have to be processed through NYU\u2019s legal channels. Fill out the MTA as best you can. Please make sure to list the PI as the user since the MTA will stay with the lab no matter how long a particular researcher will be at NYU. Fill out the required internal MRD form . Submit MTA and MRD as a signed hard copy and an unsigned electronic form to the Department Administrator who will maintain a copy in the Biology office and forward to our contacts in the Office of the Industrial Liaison. The Office of the Industrial Liaison does any negotiating with the supplier and will be in contact with you if they have additional questions. They will send you and the supplier a fully executed copy of the MTA. Note: The best way to expedite the process is make sure the MRD form is filled out quickly and forwarded along with the MTA. Many companies automatically send the MTA to the Office of the Industrial Liaison, but without the internal MRD form nothing will happen and the process will be delayed.       How do I get my poster printed in the Biology office?       [ Direct link ]   Email your poster to fas.bio.computing@nyu.edu in one of the following formats: PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Adobe Illustrator. We stock 36 inch wide HP Semi-Gloss paper and recommend setting the document dimensions to 36 x 48 inches with 0 inch margins when creating your poster. Borderless prints are only available for 36 x 48 inch documents. Keep important text or images at least 6 millimeters from the poster's edge since the printer automatically enlarges the poster slightly in order to print over the edges of the paper. Posters are not waterproof. We recommend bringing a poster tube or plastic bag when rain is expected. Printing of draft copies and reprints is strongly discouraged. If you are participating in the annual Undergraduate Research Conference, MS poster session or the annual Non-retreating Retreat, please allow plenty of time to print your poster. The printer gets backlogged before these events.          How do I get swipe access? Change my access? Or fix my access?       [ Direct link ]   To request access for the first time: Complete the Building Access Application form on our forms page . The form must be signed by your PI or your labs designee. Submit the completed form to the Administrative Aide in the Biology Department Office located on the 10th floor of the Silver Building, room 1009. Alternately you can deliver your form to the 8th floor of the CGSB if you are located in that building. It can take up to 72 hours for security to make our requested changes.  To change my swipe access: If you already have a Building Access Application form on file, you may email a requested change or addition to biology@nyu.edu. You must cc your PI for approval.

[ Direct link ]   A limited supply of postdoctoral apartments are available to the science departments. To be eligible for a postdoc apartment you must meet the following requirements: You hold the title of Postdoctoral Associate (Payroll Code 103) or Postdoctoral Fellow (Payroll Code 103/542) You are no more than 5 years out from receiving your PhD You have never held a tenure-track position You work in the lab of an investigator whose primary appointment is in one of the five FAS science departments If you meet these requirements, complete the Postdoctoral Housing Application . Submit the application along with a signed copy of your offer or appointment letter to your PI. Your PI has to be the one to make the official request by sending your materials to the Administrator in their building (Julie Kim, Silver Complex or Carrie Nygard, CGSB). The administrator will submit your materials to the Housing Department and they will contact you when housing becomes available.  Notes:  PLAN AHEAD! There is a wait list for post doc housing! Ideally this process is started during the recruitment phase of employment. Applicants are usually on the list for more than one month and housing is never guaranteed to be available by a certain date. The wait has been as long as 6-12 months in past years. If the applicant is still on the wait list by the time they start working, they will be responsible for finding their own housing. NYU DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY TEMPORARY PLACEMENT OR HELP! Postdocs are assigned studio apartments unless they have a child in which case they can request a 1 bedroom apartment. There are very few 1 bedrooms available. Housing extensions are only granted in extreme cases when there is a waitlist and only at the discretion of the Chair.       How do I reserve a Biology conference room?

If you qualify for an exemption it must be well documented at the time of purchase. Contact the Budget Assistant for more details.         Submitting Your Reimbursement through AP Workflow       Select the correct approval path. If you are unsure which path to use please contact the Budget Assistant, or the Financial Analyst.      Indicate yourself as the contact.      Double check that the home address selected is current as the system does not purge outdated addresses and new addresses populate the bottom of the list and not the top.      These are the most common account codes you will encounter. Insert into the first 5 digits of the chartfield section:            Travel \u2013 Domestic 65510    Travel \u2013 Foreign 65520    Travel \u2013 Local (no overnight stay) 65550    Dinner/Food (include tax &amp; tip) 65182    Alcohol (must ALWAYS be separated out from any food charge) 65183    Lab Supplies/Small lab equipment &lt;$3,000 63210    Equipment costing &gt;$3,000 62100    Office Supplies 63110    Property or Equipment Repair 64305          Notes:      Alcohol must always be separated out of a meal/food receipt and charged to its own line under account code 65183. If no alcohol was charged during a meal, it is helpful to write \"No alcohol purchased\" on your receipt.      If you are unsure about what chartfield to use, first talk to your PI. Then contact the Budget Assistant or the Financial Analyst for help.      *Remember that alcohol, office supplies, membership fees (even when it makes meeting registration cheaper), journal subscriptions or grant writing costs are never allowed on federal projects.          You will attach an electronic copy of all supporting documentation on the preview page. As a general rule of thumb, all receipts must be itemized, show the total cost of purchase, and proof of payment. If any information is missing, then the documentation is considered insufficient and you will need to include a signed \u201c missing/inadequate doc report \u201d. You will need a missing/inadequate doc report to accompany each insufficient document. The form must be included along with the insufficient documentation, it cannot replace it.      Your reimbursement request will get routed to the Budget Assistant for review before it is sent to the next level of approval. If there are any issues, he/she will contact you with the necessary corrections.         Additional Instructions for Travel Reimbursements       Register your travel through NYU Traveler whenever possible. If you are traveling with undergraduate students, using NYU Traveler is required.      You must include your boarding passes for reimbursement so be sure to retain them during your travel.    The business purpose of your trip must be explicitly stated. If it is not clear from your documentation you must upload a statement that explains the reason you took the trip and how it related to working at NYU. Additionally, you must include proof that you attended the business reason for the travel (i.e. meeting program, name tag, letter of attendance from the organization, etc.).      Meals can be submitted as one of two methods (but cannot be a combination).      Submit as Receipts: There is no maximum amount on daily claims if submitting receipts. Each meal receipt must be itemized.      Submit as Per Diem: You can claim up to $50/day for domestic travel. The first and last days of travel must be prorated . Foreign travel has different per diem rates depending on the site. Refer to Office of Allowances site for rates under the \u201cM &amp; IE Rate\u201d column.               Travel Advances:      Travel reimbursements can only be submitted within 30 days once you have returned and the trip is completed. You may request an advance beforehand, which will require an extra reconciliation step, which falls under the responsibility of the requester to do, once the trip is completed. Any un-reconciled advances will be considered taxable income as the university will assume that the travel was never executed. If advances are left outstanding, then AP will reject any future advance requests. To close out an advance, you will create a reimbursement request. The reimbursement will follow the same guidelines explained above, which will include the details and amounts of the charges claimed in the advance and you may include any other expenses that were incurred during the travel. On the main page you will indicate the advance amount in the \u201cInvoices Information\u201d section. Find the correct advance in the drop down labeled, \u201cOutstanding Advances\u201d. Once you have selected the advance, the advance amount will automatically deduct from the \u201cGrand Total\u201d line in the \u201cExpense/Account Detail Information\u201d section. The grand total will be $0, unless you included expenses that were not included in the advance, then the grand total will reflect the total amount of the additional expenses. Notes : For reimbursements for departmental expenses (anything covered by department funds instead of lab funds) you must first contact one of the Department Administrators who will review the expense and either provide you with a chartfield, or handle the reimbursement for you, whichever is appropriate for the situation.

[ Direct link ]   The first step to voluntarily ending your employment at NYU is to work with your faculty sponsor to decide what your end date will be. In order to have your unused vacation days cashed out you must give 30 days notice. You will need to write a resignation letter that includes the following: A statement that you are ending your employment at NYU. Your last day worked. The reason you are ending your employment. An original signature. Email is not sufficient. Bring the original copy to the Financial Analyst in the Biology office who will ensure that you are removed from the payroll system. If this is not done in a timely manner you may receive paychecks that will have to be repaid to NYU. You will receive a standard separation acknowledgment letter via email   in response. This is a legal requirement. On the last day of employment   you should surrender your ID card to the Financial Analyst.   Sample Letter:  Dear Professor Smith I am ending my employment in your lab as of January 2nd, 2012 in order to pursue a faculty position at Yale University. Thank you, Postdoc Doe        How do we set up a UPS account for our lab?       [ Direct link ]   NYU has an exclusive agreement with UPS to handle university shipping and as such will only allow UPS accounts to bill automatically. PIs may request a UPS account for their lab by filling out the UPS account form . The PI must determine the chartfield they wish to use for the account. The chartfield should begin with 63130-fund-org-program-project. School/Department is FAS/Biology. Fax the completed form to the number indicated and a member of NYU\u2019s Mail Services (Campus Ship division, 998-1012) will contact you to complete the process.       How to I get a phone or request a change on my phone?       [ Direct link ]   Contact your Department Administrator and give them the following information: PI name, the specific service or product that you are requesting, the building, the room number, and the jack number that will be used. They will follow up with you.  Note: The Department supplies 1 phone per faculty and 1 phone for their lab personnel (with a multi handset phone system). If you wish to request an additional line, please speak to the Director of Administration.       I\u2019m a new employee, what do I have to do?       [ Direct link ]   Welcome to NYU Biology! We are glad you are here. To make your first few weeks here successful, here the steps you need to complete: Payroll: One or before your first day you must visit the Financial Analyst to complete your new hire paperwork. This is a federal regulation so it is very important that you take care of this right away. Come to the Biology Department office with: A copy of your signed offer letter (if you did not mail it in advance). Proof that you are eligible to work in the United States for your I9 form. See page 5 for a list of acceptable documents you can bring. Do not fill out the form in advance. If you are on a working visa, be sure to bring a copy of your passport, I-94 card and visa documents (DS-2019 or I-797 for example). A cancelled/voided check, to enroll in direct deposit, and the completed form . A completed W4 tax form . A copy of your most recent CV. While in the office you will turn in your documents, fill out the I9 form and sign a labor law form. If you do not have a social security card, you will receive instructions on how to apply for one during the meeting. About 48 hours after completing your employment paperwork, an ID Card Authorization form will be available for you to pick up from the office. You will need it to get your NYU ID card. Please note: You should expect your first paycheck to come one month after your start date and the first check is almost always paper (even if you have enrolled in direct deposit) so you will need to pick it up from the office. Benefits: Within 10 business days of submitting your new employment paperwork you should receive an email from the benefits office with instructions on how to log into iLearn where you will enroll in your benefits. You have 31 days from your start date to enroll in benefits so please do not delay in completing the process. Contact the Financial Analyst if the email does not come in the time frame mentioned. See the benefits page for more information on what is available to code 103 employees. Please note that code 103/542 fellows only receive medical and dental coverage.  ID Card:   Once you pick up your ID Authorization form from the office you can get your new NYU ID card. Take your form to the Card Center located at 383 Lafayette Street (Corner of E. 4th and Lafayette St), Ground Floor. Give them your form and show them a valid ID such as a driver's license or passport and they will issue your new card. You will need to bring your card back to the Biology office so we can make a copy for your file. Now that you have your ID you can request swipe access to the building/lab. NYU Email Address: Once you have your ID card you will see your netID listed on the back. You will need to activate your netID in order to set up your email. ITS has instructions here.   MyTime: Employee time is monitored through MyTime. If you are a full time code 103 or code 103/542 employee, MyTime only monitors your vacation, sick and personal day requests. If you are an code 113, 118, or 119 then you will log your hours into your timesheet on the MyTime system. It is very important that you learn how to use the system. Video training is available through iLearn which you can access through NYUHome. Other resources: Quick guide . FAQs . Student employee guide .  Building/Lab Access: Almost all research spaces in the Department are secured. You can request swipe access by filling out the access form online, having your PI (faculty sponsor) sign it and submitting it to the Administrative Aide in the Biology Department. It can take up to 72 hours for security to process our requests. While you are in the office, be sure to let Michelle know you are new so she can add you to the email list serve and add you to the lab directory. Health &amp; Safety: All new employees (including faculty) must meet with Christina Lyman, the Facilities Manager (cel4@nyu.edu). When you schedule your appointment, let her know which lab you have joined and your position (postdoc, technician, programmer, etc). In your meeting she will advise you on the types of safety training you require, explain whether or not you are required to obtain a Certificate of Fitness, orient you on other facilities and Health &amp; Safety related issues, and provide you with a New Researcher Packet. Be sure to review the other FAQs for Research Staff to learn more about Biology procedures. Once again, welcome aboard!       I'm applying for or have a pre or postdoctoral fellowship. What do I need to know?       [ Direct link ]   Fellowship proposals require the same internal approvals as faculty proposals. Getting institutional signatures take time so please notify the Grants Administrator as soon as possible once you have decided to apply for a fellowship. Please review the NYU Office of Sponsored Program\u2019s proposal submission policies. When you email the Grants Administrator please include a link to the funding opportunity in the email and   prepare the following for the a brief meeting: Project Title Project Start and End Dates Budget: amount to request and preliminary budget breakdown ideas: Personnel (Co-Investigators, postdocs, graduate students, consultants, subcontractors) Equipment Supplies Travel Other Letters of Support or Collaboration Human or animal subject approvals, if applicable Please note that most proposals are now submitted electronically. You may need to register for a username prior to submission. NYU uses Cayuse 424 and Cayuse SP for submission and administration of proposals and awards, which also requires user registration. Details on how to   register for each of these user profiles can be founds here .   Please do not wait until the last minute to register. If you are   registered already but with a previous institution you must change your   affiliate to NYU. Does a fellowship affect my NYU benefits as a postdoc? When you are awarded a fellowship, your NYU payroll code will change from 103 (Post Doctoral Associate) to 542/103 (Post Doctoral Fellow). Depending on the funding agency, your mentor/sponsor (lab PI) may be required to re-appoint you for a minimum amount that must be charged to his or her unrestricted account. Typically, this is not required for NIH fellowships (internal) but is required for NSF, HFSP &amp; EMBO (external). Regardless of the agency providing the stipend, please note that the only benefits you will continue to receive are employee medical and dental . Vision, tuition remission, commuter benefits, retirement, vacation and sick time accruals etc. no longer apply. Please also note that to receive paid bonding leave you must be an employee for 2 consecutive years and time as a fellow will not be counted and may reset your 2 year clock. The department strongly advises you to consult with the Benefits Office regarding the most current policy for a code 103 employee converting to a code 542/103 employee. The Benefits office can be reached at benefits@nyu.edu or 212-998-1270. It can take a month for your payroll code to change within University payroll systems. Please contact the Financial Analyst as soon as you receive the award to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible. When you become a code 542/103 your tax status may also change. Please contact NYU payroll at AskPeopleLink@nyu.edu or 212-992-5465 for the most up to date information. What forms or trainings do I need?  FORMS 1. Annual Conflict of Interest/Commitment Disclosure  Mandatory for federally funded researchers Submitted via online survey ( http://nyu.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_dfZ5AMOHZVsSODa ) Completed once a year, form is revised in the summer for the upcoming academic/fiscal year 2.

Do I have to attend?       [ Direct link ]   According to NIH notice NOT-OD-10-019, the responsible conduct of research (RCR) is defined as the practice of scientific investigation with integrity. It involves the awareness and application of established professional norms and ethical principles in the performance of all activities related to scientific research. Therefore, instruction in responsible conduct of research is an integral part of all research training programs. NSF considers education in RCR essential in the preparation of future scientists and engineers. You may be required to have RCR certification, depending on which agency funds the research project you work on. Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Training is required for:    Any undergraduate student, graduate student, or postdoctoral researcher supported by NSF to conduct research on a project whose proposal was submitted on or after January 4, 2010 Any NIH T, F or K awardee All first or second year PhD candidate in the Biology Department   Categories (A) and (B) is required under the terms of your PI's/your grant agreement. Category (C) is recommended as part of your PhD training. Attendance records must be kept for departmental, University, and Federal compliance. Please send a copy of your certificate to the Biology Grants admin so it can be added to your file. Currently for Biology, this training is achieved through a combination of the three lecture series below:  1. Center for Neural Science (CNS)  7 sessions held once a year in the Spring semester Historically Thursdays 6:30pm-8:30pm (Feb \u2013 May), Meyer Building http://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/emergsci/ 2. Office of Postdoctoral Affairs (OPA)  2 sessions in the Fall semester which are repeated in the Spring semester historically Fridays 9:00am-11:00am , Kimmel Center http://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/training-and-certification/rcrtraining.html 3. University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects (UCAIHS) 1 session offered twice in the Fall semester which is repeated in the Spring historically Thursdays 4:00pm-6:00pm, 665 Broadway http://www.nyu.edu/research/resources-and-support-offices/getting-started-withyourresearch/human-subjects-research/ucaihs-trainings.html The seven (7) CNS sessions are enough to fulfill the RCR requirement. You DO NOT have to take the two (2) OPA sessions and one (1) UCAIHS session in addition to the CNS sessions. However, if you miss one of the CNS sessions you can make it up with the corresponding OPA or UCAIHS course and still fulfill the requirement (see below). Questions? email sr147@nyu.edu (Suzan Runko, Biology Grants Administrator). CNS sessions: Research Misconduct and Conflict of Interest (equivalent to OPA #1) Ethical Considerations in Research with Human Subjects (equivalent to UCAIHS #1) Publication practice (equivalent to OPA #2) Ethical considerations animal Data acquisition, Management, Sharing &amp; Ownership Survival skills for a career in research Mentor/Trainee Responsibilities, and Collaboration in Science OPA sessions: Research Misconduct/Conflict of Interest (equivalent to CNS #1) Introduction to Responsible Conduct of Research; Publication &amp; Authorship (equivalent to CNS #3) UCAIHS session: IRB Made Easy (equivalent to CNS #2)       Facilities &amp; Resources       How do I get a lab coat? and how do I get it cleaned?       [ Direct link ]   The department provides lab coats for researchers and pays to have them cleaned. The department maintains a stock of lab coats in various sizes. We no longer assign coats to specific people. Go to one of the lab coat closets listed below and pull a coat in the size you need. You may use it as long as you like. When it needs to be cleaned, put it in the dirty coat drop box. In the CGSB, clean lab coats and the dirty lab coat drop off are located in the rear elevator vestibule on the 2nd floor. In the Silver/Waverly/Brown complex, clean lab coats are located in the Biology Office coat closet and the dirty lab coat drop off is outside the office next to the vending machines.        How do I get a red biohazard box or sharps container?       [ Direct link ]   Biohazard boxes (more formally called Regulated Medical Waste boxes) and sharps containers are available by requesting them from Client Services (ext.81001). Sharps containers come in two sizes, small (bench top) or large (floor) so be sure to specify. It may take Client Services some time to respond so if you need boxes or sharps containers immediately, contact Christian Bermejo in the CGSB receiving room (ext.87856). He keeps a limited supply on hand.       How do I get Ethanol to use in the lab?       [ Direct link ]   The department buys Ethanol in bulk and supplies it to the labs. Both 95% gallons and 100% pints are available. Brown/Silver/Waverly: It is currently stored on the 6th floor of the Silver Center. Pick up is scheduled through Christian Bermejo. Please call ext 87856 or email cb102@nyu.edu to schedule a pick up. CGSB: It is currently stored on the 2nd floor of the CGSB. Pick up is scheduled through Christian Bermejo. Please call ext 87856 or email cb102@nyu.edu to schedule a pick up.       How do I request a new broken glass box? Or get a full one removed?       [ Direct link ]   In the CGSB, broken glass boxes are available from Christian Bermejo in the receiving room (LL2). In the Silver/Brown/Waverly complex broken glass boxes are available through the Chemistry department across the hall from Brown 150 receiving room. You will receive the box with a form sticker outlining the rules for use. You must follow the rules carefully or your full box will be returned to you. Most importantly all glass must be clean and dry. Once the box is full the form sticker on the side of the box must be filled out and the box must be closed up for disposal. For disposal, call ext. 81001 and request a pickup. Place the box in the same location where you put your red biohazard boxes for disposal (different for each building). The box will be picked up within a few days.       How do I reserve the auditorium or a classroom in the CGSB (Center for Genomics & Systems Biology, 12 Waverly Place)?       [ Direct link ]   The auditorium and classrooms in the Genome Center (12 Waverly Place) do not belong exclusively to the Biology Department. They are considered general use classrooms and are therefore managed by Classroom Assignments. Please work with them to secure the room for your event by emailing classroom.scheduling@nyu.edu. Because these rooms are used for classes, scheduling meetings during the academic year can be difficult and often Classroom Assignments can not confirm space requests until the semester is underway and classes are all assigned rooms (since priority is given to using these rooms as classrooms). If you are a member of NYU Biology, an administrator from the department will work with Classroom Assignments on your behalf. Contact Carrie Nygard (cen249@nyu.edu, x88341) and cc Michelle Devol (mrd3@nyu.edu, x88209) with the date, time and a brief description of your meeting/event. We will do our best to help you gain access to the space you need. If you are interested in scheduling your course into the Genome Center please be aware of a few things. While Biology does not manage these rooms directly, the Department gets priority booking for its courses (other Science Departments get priority after Biology and before non-science departments). When requesting a classroom in the Genome Center, you increase your chances of getting space if you qualify for priority.      The course enrollment should be at least 80% of the room\u2019s capacity (see chart below).    The enrollment cap of the course (as listed in Albert) can not be greater than the room\u2019s capacity.    The course needs to follow a traditional NYU course schedule. For example; a course that meets on Mon and Wed from 11am-12:15pm is a traditional schedule. A course that only meets once a week for a longer period of time is not a traditional schedule.      A course which does not meet criteria 1&amp;3 may still receive a room in the Genome Center, however without priority the chances are not as good. There is no guarantee that a request will be granted even with priority since NYU has an overall classroom shortage.             12 Waverly Classroom Information       Room Number    Location    Capacity    Style    80% Capacity       108  Ground Floor 138 Auditorium 110    L1 11 Cellar    22 Computer Lab 17    L1 13 Cellar    20 Recitation Style 16    L1 14 Cellar    20 Recitation Style 16    L1 20 Cellar    69 Lecture Hall 55                   How do I set up a Labgear account?       [ Direct link ]   All the equipment in the Genomics Core Facility is reserved through the NYU Labgear Scheduling System. You must create an account by clicking here and following the instructions. Once you have done so you will still need authorization for the piece of equipment you want to reserve and this is granted by the Genomics Core Staff after you have completed the proper training.       How to I receive training for Genomics Core equipment?       [ Direct link ]   You may schedule a training session with the Genomics Core Staff. You may also visit here to stay updated on group trainings. ** Note : You must be trained before using any equipment in the Genomics Core and to gain authorization to make reservations in the NYU Labgear Scheduler.       What is a chartfield and how do I enter it in Labgear?       [ Direct link ]   A chartfield is an internal NYU account number that you must ask your PI or lab manager for. Depending on what project you work on in the lab, you may have a different chartfield than other members of your lab. A chartfield is made up of the following:  Account Code (#s) Fund (#s) Organization (#s &amp; Letters) Program (#s &amp; Letters) Project (#s &amp; Letters)  60455 XX XXXXX XXXXX XXXXX  To make a reservation in Labgear you will enter your chartfield in the following format: 60455-XX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX ** If you have a blank in any part of your chartfield, denote it with XXXXX.       What is the data policy for the Genomics Core Shared Instrumentation computers?       [ Direct link ]   It is the researcher's responsibility to backup and remove his/her data at the end of a run or experiment. The Genomics Core reserves the right to erase data permanently from the shared instrumentation computers when performance starts to diminish. A warning e-mail will be sent to users when this occurs.       Where can I get dry ice?       [ Direct link ]   The Department supplies dry ice to its researchers. You can find dry ice bins on the 7th and 9th floors of the Brown Building and on the L2 level near the elevator in the CGSB.       Where do I find out Genomics Core pricing and information on invoicing?       [ Direct link ]   You can ask your PI, lab manager, or the Genomics Core Manager. For invoicing information, you can also click here .       Health &amp; Safety       How do I get my required safety trainings?       [ Direct link ]   All members of the biology department (students, volunteers, employees, visiting scholars) are required to take a variety of safety training depending on the work they do. Even those who are primarily computer based researchers may need safety training depending on where they physically do their work. Many of our bioinformatics stations are located in wet bench labs. Everyone should work with the Facilities Manager, Christina Lyman ext 89041, to determine what level of training they need and to find out the dates and locations of upcoming training sessions. If you are starting a new protocol and are not sure if additional training will be required, be sure to reach out to Christina who help you plan your experiments so that the appropriate safety measures are taken to protect you and the lab.        What is a Certificate of Fitness? and do I have to get one?       [ Direct link ]   The Certificate of Fitness (CoF) is issued by the New York City Fire Department which requires all labs operating within New York City to have CoF holders. In turn the Biology Department requires all faculty, code 103 professional research staff (who hold an appointment of a year or more, i.e. Postdocs and technicians), as well as all PhD students to obtain a CoF. Getting a CoF requires taking a test at the NYFD headquarters in Brooklyn or, depending on your research experience, a mail in option. We have tried to make this process as easy as possible for you. See the Facilities Manager for your application packet and step by step instructions. The Department covers the cost of the certificate. You will need to renew your CoF for the duration of your time in the Biology Department.                     Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
