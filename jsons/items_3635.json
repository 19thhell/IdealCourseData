Using biochemical and genetic approaches with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , students characterize a large multisubunit protein complex that modifies chromatin and is involved in gene regulation. S. cerevisiae is a unicellular eukaryote, better known as baker's yeast, that is a widely used biochemical and genetic model organism. Affinity chromatography is used to produce purified preparations of wild-type and mutant protein complexes. The purified protein complexes are compared using a wide variety of biochemical techniques, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE, western blot, colorimetric enzymatic assay, and protein interaction assays. Yeast expressing the same mutants is used in genetic experiments to evaluate the importance of the protein complex in cell growth and gene regulation in the cell. Where the City Meets the Sea: Studies in Coastal Urban Environments BIOL-UA 140 Offered every fall. 4 points.
