EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform. This course examines the history of modern Chinese drama through close readings of exemplary dramatic texts, film viewings and the study of current scholarship on the topic.

Of the essay as a major genre,      critical attention as well as popular reading habit      gravitate toward the belle lettres , which took      roots in New Literature by means of a productive though      unmediated borrowing from both the Chinese classical      gentry-literati tradition and the traditions of the      modern European and Japanese essayistic practice from      Montaigne to Tanizaki, with the Anglo-American essayists      standing at the very center). This symposium, which      brings together graduate students and faculty from      Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Peking      University and the Departments of East Asian Studies and      of Comparative Literature at New York University into an      intimate and sustained dialogue, seeks to give the      modern Chinese essayistic tradition a critical attention      and scrutiny where it is due, by revisiting the literary      production of its central figures, namely the Zhou      Brothers--Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren; by reexamining the      stylistic and aesthetic properties of the essay as such;      and by probing into the ontological-political space of      the essay as it was opened up and institutionalized in      the middle of intense socio- and cultural political      battles of modern China, which, historically and in the      most personal manner, constituted the very the force      field in which the essay thrived.        The      student papers to be presented at this symposium are      work-in-progress in every sense. The PKU papers are      drawn from three graduate seminars on the essay offered      in the Chinese Department in the single semester of Fall      2010, which testified to the growing importance of this      subfield. The instructors of those seminars were      Professor Wang Feng of PKU; Professor Huang Ziping of      Hong Kong Baptist University (emeritus) and Professor      Xudong Zhang of New York University and Chang-Jiang      Chair Visiting Professor of PKU. The NYU papers have      been organized as a series of responses to the PKU paper      but with their own research and methodological focus,      resulting from NYU graduate students long-term interest      in questions regarding Chinese literary modernity and      cultural politics; comparative and interdisciplinary      approach to literary analysis; and in translation      theory. As an event in the long list of activities      generated by the NYU-PKU exchange and cooperation      program, which recently led to the formal launching of      the International Center for Critical Theory, PKU-NYU,      the symposium is meant to be not a conclusion but rather      a new point of departure for successive efforts at      cracking the nut of the modern Chinese essay as an      object of historical, aesthetic, and political analysis,      which has been unfolding in the form of numerous reading      groups, graduate seminars, workshops, and research      conferences taking place at PKU, East China Normal      University in Shanghai, University of Tokyo's Center of      Philosophy (UTCP) since the winter of 2006. From the      perspective of programmatic and curricular development,      however, It is no exaggeration to say that \"Lu Xun and      the Politics of Chinese Modern Essay\" has been one of      the nodal points on which different institutional and      critical sources of energy converged and, eventually,      gave rise to initial frames and shapes of International      Center for Critical Theory.

EAST-UA 91 East Asian Art II: China , Korea, Japan from 1000 CE to Present (4 credits) Instructor: Michele Matteini Art History sponsored. Same as ARTH-UA 511. An introductory survey of the arts in China, Japan, and Korea from approximately 1000 C.E. Emphasizes an overall understanding of the development of art and culture, as well as mastery of specific works of art. East Asian Art I followed the development of the common cultural heritage of the Northeast Asia region. Part of this commonality is due to the extraordinary influence of an early-developing Chinese civilization on Japan and Korea. However, Japan and Korea also developed their own cultures and arts, developments that accelerated in the last millennia up to the present. Topics include Song landscape paintings, Edo \"floating world\" prints, Koryo celadons, and modern art.         EAST-UA 517 Problems in Contemporary China (4 credits) Instructor: Rebecca Karl Same as HIST-UA 538 This course is designed to examine intensively several major problems in contemporary China (1980s to the present). On the one hand, these problems can be seen as partially representative of China\u2019s social, economic, and intellectual transformation from a Maoist-socialist state to a quasi-capitalist one-party state, transformations that have had and continue to have far-reaching consequences for China and the world in the past three decades; on the other hand, these problems also can be seen as representative of global transformations that chronologically coincided with and helped shape the direction of China\u2019s changes, as China firmly integrated itself into global capitalism and its attendant systems of knowledge production and social formations beginning in the 1980s.      EAST-UA 519 Law &amp; Justice in Chinese Society (4 credits) Instructor: Masato Hasegawa History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 551. As calls for government openness and transparency increase in China, the notion and application of the rule of law in Chinese society has become the subject of an intense debate both within and beyond China. This seminar aims to situate the contemporary debate over China's rule of law in a broader historical context and examines the historical processes of the production and interpretation of law in China from the pre-modern period to the modern era. Particular emphasis will be placed on assessing the manner in which the notion of justice has been defined and invoked in Chinese historical sources. The general course format combines critical reading of texts and active discussion. Readings will include both contemporary historical scholarship on law and society in China and an array of primary source materials in English or in English translation. Some background knowledge of Chinese history will be helpful, but is not required.      EAST-UA 531 Asia's Revolutions: China/India/Vietnam 1885-1962 (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts Same as HIST-UA 538.                               The aim of this introductory course is to establish a framework    for modern Asian history by a comparative approach to the national    independence movements in China, India, and Vietnam, as well as    the context within which they unfolded, in the period 1885-1962,    that is, from the Sino-French War to the Sino-Indian War. We    begin with the questions: why could there be no Gandhi in China,    no Mao in India? And how does Ho Chi Minh compare to these two    figures? The course will introduce students to some of the figures in    modern Asian history who played a major role in the transition of    India and Vietnam from colonial subordination to independent    nationhood and of China from its semi-colonial status to    liberation. The principal figures whose lives and writings will be    studied and compared are Mohandas Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sun    Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh. The course will give due    attention to other relevant figures such as M. Jinnah in the case    of India; Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; Phan Boi Chau in    the case of Vietnam. The main focus of the course is comparing    India and China, which have separate internal dynamics and little    to do with one another until World War Two, and then become    crucially involved in the post World War Two / Cold War world. Since war together with revolution constitutes the determinative    process of this historical period, we will pay attention to the    sequence of wars after 1885: the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the    Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), World War One (1914-18), the    Siberian Intervention (1918-23), the invasion of Manchuria (1931),    the Resistance War of China against Japan (1937-45), World War Two    in the Pacific, the Korean War, and the Indochina Wars (up to    1962). We will also compare the internal struggle in India,    between the Hindu and Muslim communities, leading to the formation    of Pakistan in 1947, and in China between the Communists and the    Nationalists, leading to the completion of the revolution in    1949. Consideration is given to the role of Tibet as a site of    conflict between India and China, the main cause of the    Sino-Indian War of 1962.      EAST-UA 552 The Cold War in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: James L Peck History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 552 This course will focus on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) will be the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We will examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early US global economic visions; the US and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon\u2019s global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H. W. Bush and Asia\u2019s place in \u201ca New World Order;\u201d and finally, the Clinton and George W. Bush years. Throughout the course, we shall examine key de-classified National Security documents, interpreting their meaning and language, while carefully assessing the arguments used to justify American policy. EAST-UA 610 Korean Modernism (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course explores the key debates and questions about modernity with a   focus on Colonial Korea. The concept of modernity\u2014as a particular   historical moment as well as a new thought system\u2014has emerged from the   rise of nation states, the development of capitalism,   and the growth of bodies of scientific knowledge. It indicates a   radical break from tradition, disenchantment with the religious life,   and strong belief in reason and progress. It also celebrates the newness   emerging from the interaction between the self and   the other, and an openness to the foreign and the world. This course   juxtaposes various interpretations of \u201cmodern\u201d events of colonial Korea   in conversation with theories that explicate modernity and what it means   to be modern. We will explore historiographies,   novels, and films dealing with the following themes: national ideology   and national bodies, economic and political contentions, modern   education and scientific management, class and gender formation,   capitalism and urbanization, colonial migration and cosmopolitanism,   anti-colonialism and socialist/revolutionary thought.\u200b      EAST-UA 613 Japanese Cinema (4 credits) Instructor: TBD Same as DRLIT-UA 613. This course examines Japanese cinema from its prehistory to its contemporary developments. The focus will be on the rise of Japanese subculture/popular culture in the 1980s and onward, and its long-term implications. The course is organized roughly chronologically, tracing major historical developments of Japanese popular culture, literature and film from the early modern (17-19th century) to the modern (20-21st century) period. Topics include Japanese pure film movement, genbun-itchi (unification of written-spoken language), benshi (orators), Ozu, anime (Japanese animation), \u201cthe end of literature\u201d discourse, and Japanese nouvelle-vague. This course includes screenings of film with English subtitles.      EAST-UA 710 Japan &amp; WWII in Asia (4 credits) Instructor: George S Solt History sponsored. Same as HIST-UA 710.     The course examines Japan and World War II in Asia from a variety of critical perspectives. Two themes in particular will be highlighted throughout the course. First, we will consider how imperialism and colonialism of both the Euro-American and Japanese varieties were central to the War\u2019s outbreak, conduct, and resolution. Second, we will explore various local experiences and memories of the war. These will include the experiences and memories of marginalized groups in Japan and its colonies, \u201ccomfort women,\u201d victims of war atrocities, Japanese Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Please note that we will discuss the readings in class every week. Therefore, you must keep up with the readings and complete the weekly assignments.      EAST-UA 729 Traditional Drama China &amp; Japan (4 credits) Instructor: Moss Roberts The course will compare a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention will be given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate scenes or entire plays will be screened for the class or assigned for viewing. EAST-UA 731 20th Century Chinese Literature in Translation (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp Realism has often been regarded as a dominant force in modern Chinese literature, but other styles of representation have also been important to Chinese literary creativity during the 20th century. This course examines the significance of three modes of literary \u201cexcess\u201d that disrupt the expectations of realism- the fantastic, the grotesque and the sublime \u2013 in the history of Chinese literature from the late-Qing dynasty to the late-20th century. While each of these modes possesses links to traditional Chinese culture, they have also provided new expressive resources for reflecting the reconfiguration of social values and human perception in China during the modern era. Focusing on close readings of fiction and some poetry, we will examine how Chinese writers have used the fantastic to transgress the boundaries of the real, employed the grotesque to expose reality\u2019s ugliness, and invoked the sublime to try to invest literature with the potential to change reality.  EAST-UA 736 Issues and Debates in Contemporary Korea (4 credits) Instructor: June Hee Kwon This course aims to understand the principles, logics, and dynamics that   have constituted the contemporary divided Korea\u2014with a particular focus   on South Korea. The postcolonial era in Korea soon led to the Korean   War and then the Cold War, which took the   two Koreas down dramatically different pathways. South Korea achieved   rapid and dramatic economic development, eventually witnessing exemplary   democratization movements emerge from the fight against dictatorial   government, class inequality, and sexual discrimination.   Despite an earlier start on economic development following its   socialist revolution, North Korea has suffered from a poor economy and a   repressive authoritarian regime. Paying attention to Cold War politics   as a major influence in creating and sustaining the   two Koreas, we explore three primary themes in the history of   contemporary Korea: 1) Nationalism, 2) Developmentalism, and 3)   Neoliberalism. The subtopics include: the Korean War and its impact,   anti-communistic nationalism and state violence, developmentalism   and democracy, class differentiation and gender formation,   multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism, urbanization and environmental   issues, youth and precarious labor, North Korea and human rights.        EAST-UA 832 Intro to Buddhism (4 credits) Instructor: Christopher Kelley Religious Studies sponsored. Same as RELST-UA 832 An introduction to this complex religion, emphasizing its history, teachings, and practices. Discusses its doctrinal development in India, then emphasizes certain local practices: Buddhism and the family in China; Buddhism, language, and hierarchy in Japan; the politics of Buddhist Tibet; and Buddhist art. Finally, the course touches on Buddhism in the United States.      EAST-UA 950 Topics in Asian Studies: The Planetary Imagination (4 credits) Instructor: Phil Kaffen The planetary has emerged a contested site across a variety of fields   from comparative literature and area studies to media studies and   philosophy. Partly marking itself off from older universalist claims   (cosmopolitanism, world history, globalization), the planetary   imagination as we will discuss it in this class foregrounds an   ecological dimension and at the same time, shifts the grounds of   human-centered thought and politics. While touching on a wide variety of   issues, including technology, scale, identity, and ethics, the core   problem for the class will be to consider \u201cthe world\u201d from a standpoint   that does not privilege the human as its center or apex. The goal of the   course is neither to immediately endorse nor repudiate a critique of   anthropocentrism, but to examine some of its diverse forms of   expression, underlying assumptions, and possible repercussions. To that   end, this class seeks to explore the planetary imagination from a   broadly (and possibly contradictory) humanities-based perspective, at   the intersection of area studies (East Asia in particular) and   comparative literature\u2014through fiction, philosophy, and contemporary   arts and media.      EAST-UA 952 Topics in Chinese Studies: Modern Chinese Drama (4 credits) Instructor: Max Bohnenkamp   China has always been home to a rich theatrical tradition, visible in such forms as Kun and Beijing operas. Yet beginning in the late-1800s, new knowledge of Western culture inspired major creative attempts to modernize the traditional theater and to introduce foreign styles of performance. While the efforts of such figures as Mei Lanfang led to the transformation of Beijing opera into China\u2019s first form of internationally- known theater, the spoken dramas of modern playwrights like Cao Yu and Tian Han offered realist plays of social critique to advance the reform of Chinese culture. Upon such foundations, drama developed into one of the most important and contested areas of artistic innovation and public engagement through China\u2019s 20th-century history of war, revolution and reform.

Of the essay as a major genre,      critical attention as well as popular reading habit      gravitate toward the belle lettres , which took      roots in New Literature by means of a productive though      unmediated borrowing from both the Chinese classical      gentry-literati tradition and the traditions of the      modern European and Japanese essayistic practice from      Montaigne to Tanizaki, with the Anglo-American essayists      standing at the very center). This symposium, which      brings together graduate students and faculty from      Department of Chinese Language and Literature at Peking      University and the Departments of East Asian Studies and      of Comparative Literature at New York University into an      intimate and sustained dialogue, seeks to give the      modern Chinese essayistic tradition a critical attention      and scrutiny where it is due, by revisiting the literary      production of its central figures, namely the Zhou      Brothers--Lu Xun and Zhou Zuoren; by reexamining the      stylistic and aesthetic properties of the essay as such;      and by probing into the ontological-political space of      the essay as it was opened up and institutionalized in      the middle of intense socio- and cultural political      battles of modern China, which, historically and in the      most personal manner, constituted the very the force      field in which the essay thrived.        The      student papers to be presented at this symposium are      work-in-progress in every sense. The PKU papers are      drawn from three graduate seminars on the essay offered      in the Chinese Department in the single semester of Fall      2010, which testified to the growing importance of this      subfield. The instructors of those seminars were      Professor Wang Feng of PKU; Professor Huang Ziping of      Hong Kong Baptist University (emeritus) and Professor      Xudong Zhang of New York University and Chang-Jiang      Chair Visiting Professor of PKU. The NYU papers have      been organized as a series of responses to the PKU paper      but with their own research and methodological focus,      resulting from NYU graduate students long-term interest      in questions regarding Chinese literary modernity and      cultural politics; comparative and interdisciplinary      approach to literary analysis; and in translation      theory. As an event in the long list of activities      generated by the NYU-PKU exchange and cooperation      program, which recently led to the formal launching of      the International Center for Critical Theory, PKU-NYU,      the symposium is meant to be not a conclusion but rather      a new point of departure for successive efforts at      cracking the nut of the modern Chinese essay as an      object of historical, aesthetic, and political analysis,      which has been unfolding in the form of numerous reading      groups, graduate seminars, workshops, and research      conferences taking place at PKU, East China Normal      University in Shanghai, University of Tokyo's Center of      Philosophy (UTCP) since the winter of 2006. From the      perspective of programmatic and curricular development,      however, It is no exaggeration to say that \"Lu Xun and      the Politics of Chinese Modern Essay\" has been one of      the nodal points on which different institutional and      critical sources of energy converged and, eventually,      gave rise to initial frames and shapes of International      Center for Critical Theory.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

The first part examines competing approaches to international politics, explains their basic concepts and rationales, and evaluates their explanatory insights. The principal objective of this part is for students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which various theoretical perspectives lead to different understandings of the structures and practices of world politics. The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.

Working in,outside, and between places like mainlandChina, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, America, and France, Chinese-language writers may have in mind an imagined community of fellow countrymen when they write. Oftentimes, however, they may also ask provocative questions about nationalism, linguistic loyalty, and authenticity as Anglophone, Francophone, or bilingual writers living in the West. From andacross multiple cultural margins, they speak to probe the nature of modernity, cultural contact, and otherness amid the global flows of labor and ideas. How do Lu Xun, Lao She, Ha Jin, Alai, and Gao Xingjian represent China on the world stage and find their place in this picture? Where in their works can we find stylistic and cultural hybridization? How do novels and stories by Zhang Ailing, Bai Xianyong, Maxine Hong Kingston, Gish Jen, and Shirley Lim cement or deconstruct the conventional ground on which we compare Eastern and Western civilizations? What kind of an alternative literary geography, and worldview, do these writers offer?                                                                      Worldwide Chinese Diaspora - GCHN-SHU 251 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the history and complexities of worldwide Chinese migrations and diasporic communities, including change over time and evolving global diasporic relationships and interactions. A signature Global Network University course, it may be coordinated with parallel courses held at other sites in the network, so that student research on the multiple inflections of the Chinese experience of diaspora globally is both collaborative and comparative.                                Humanities                                                    Empires in World History - HUMN-SHU 269 - 4 points                               Throughout history, few people lived for very long in a polity that consisted entirely or even mainly of people with whom they shared a language and culture. Any examination of the variety of human cultures must take account of the political structures within which people tried to make their way, sometimes seeking higher degrees of autonomy, sometimes accommodating to rulers' authority, sometimes trying to extend their own power over others. Empires\u2013polities which maintained and enhanced social and cultural distinction even as they incorporated different people\u2013have been one of the most common and durable forms of political association. This course will focus on the comparative study of empires from ancient Rome and China to the present, and upon the variety of ways in which empires have inspired and constrained their subjects' ideas of rights, belonging, and power. The study of empire expands our ideas of citizenship and challenges the notion that the nation-state is natural and necessary. Students in this course will explore historians' approaches to studying empires. We will investigate how empires were held together\u2013and where they were weak\u2013 from perspectives that focus on political, cultural, and economic connections over long distances and long time periods. Readings will include historical scholarship on the Roman,Chinese, Mongol, Ottoman, Habsburg, Russian, French, British, German, and American empires, as well as primary sources produced by people living in these and other imperial polities.

Weekly assignments, team and independent projects, and project reports are required.                                                                      Animation and Dynamic Surfaces - INTM-SHU 211 - 4 points                               Contemporary animation is no longer constrained to the single flat screen; it can now be seen on surfaces of any shape and size. This course takes students from traditional animation techniques to contemporary outputs. In the first part of the course students will learn the process of character design as well as script and storyboard development to create two animated shorts. The course then examines outputs afforded by new technologies, such as interactivity, multiple screens and projection mapping. Software includes DragonFrame (for stop motion capture), Adobe After Effects and Premiere (for digital compositing, animating, and sequencing), as well MadMapper (for projection mapping), and Processing (for interactivity). Drawing skills are not necessary for this course, however students will keep a personal sketchbook.                                                                      Developing Web - INTM-SHU 231 - 4 points                               The Web now permeates most aspects of modern existence, and as a result, web development has become an indispensable skill complementary to many diverse disciplines. Students in this course will gain fluency in essential web languages and development approaches through a series of creative yet practical exercises aimed at touching on many important aspects of today\u2019s multi-faceted World Wide Web \u2013 by building responsive websites, engaging games, and rich internet applications for the desktop, mobile devices, and Arduino microcontroller. Design principles will be explored through corresponding HTML and CSS structures, and will be based on a consideration for typography, images, audio and video. Dynamic data and interaction will be investigated through client-side scripting techniques using JavaScript, including the popular jQuery library. User generated content and the importance of content management will be reflected on through server-side scripting techniques utilizing the PHP based WordPress platform. Data storage and retrieval will be made possible through the application of MySQL databases and the HTML5 Local Storage specification. And universal data exchange formats, JSON and XML, will be part of an ongoing experimentation with third party APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) such as Flickr, Freebase, Google Maps, Twitter, Xively &amp; YouTube.

Networks and Dynamics - MATH-SHU 160 - 4 points                               This is a post-calculus mathematics course that is designed to prepare students to enter a broad set of majors, from natural sciences through social sciences. The preliminary goal is to address the following challenge: today\u2019s science and world at large requires us to understand how the dynamical interactions between individual units in a complex network give rise to collective behavior, be it genetic network that makes us who we are, neural network underlying our brain functions, social network of friends through Facebook or WeChat. The language for providing a scientific understanding of such systems is the mathematics of network theory, linear algebra, and differential equations. These topics are integrated to provide a unifying course that introduces analysis methods and mathematical models for understanding dynamical network behavior. Computer simulations will be a major component of this hands-on course. Prerequisite: Grade of C or better in MATH-SHU 121 and MATH-SHU 140. Not open to students who have taken MATH-SHU 264.

It covers selected key topics in the disciplines of political, social, and cultural studies. It examines and compares Chinese and Western views on major developments and current issues. The course also introduces students to a variety of styles of writing and research methods as well as skills of cultural translation relevant to the study of contemporary China and Chinese thought.                                                                      Growing Shanghai, Shrinking Detroit - CCSF-SHU 124 - 4 points                               Less than a century ago, the Paris-of-the-East Shanghai and the Paris-of-the-West Detroit belonged to the most modern, booming metropolises in the world, until both cities declined. Today, the global city of Shanghai has revived its old glory days, while Detroit officially filed for bankruptcy in July this year. In this course, we take Shanghai and Detroit as case studies to examine the challenges and consequences of our fast-urbanizing world. We will explore the historical and economic factors influencing the transformation of these cities, as well as look at how its citizens are experiencing these sweeping changes.
