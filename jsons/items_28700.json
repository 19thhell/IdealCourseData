The NYU Prototyping Fund is a collaborative program offered by the Greenhouse at NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering and the NYU Entrepreneurial Institute . Students are eligible to receive up to $500 in funding to be used to build a hardware or software prototype. These prototypes should help you articulate and test your assumptions and move to the next stage of product development.                 Applications for the Spring '15 Prototyping Fund are open! Apply here!                                         Who is this for?   The Prototyping Fund is for students who are passionate about building new products and have an idea for an innovative hardware or software technology.     Funds must be used for tools and materials to build the prototype (not to pay someone else to build it for you)   All NYU students (undergrad and grad) are eligible to apply   Teams will be given preference (individual applicants will be considered)   Multi-school collaborations will be given preference   All teams must have at least one NYU or NYU-Poly student, but may also included members from outside the University as well              How will the funds be distributed?     Awards will be granted twice per year (Fall and Spring semesters)   ~8 \u2013 12 teams will receive awards each semester   Applicants can apply for up to $500 in prototyping funds   All funds will be distributed as a reimbursement for your expenses (when you provide a receipt)              What are the selection criteria?     Clarity of vision about what you'll do with the funds   Understanding of why you need a prototype and what it will help you achieve               Resources and Events   Workshop: A prototyping workshop with hardware and software experts from the community will be offered at the start of each semester   Equipment: Teams will be responsible for accessing the resources needed to build prototypes, but will be given access to key partners who can provide access to equipment and tools   Showcase: All funded projects will participate in an event at the end of the semester to showcase your prototypes. We\u2019ll ask each team to reflect on:     What you learned by building testing your prototypes   What you would do next if you were to continue working on the project            Key Dates - Spring 2015 Awards     Feb 4th: Applications Due   Feb 11th: Award announcements made   Week of Feb 16th: IDEO Prototyping Workshop   April 30th: Project Showcase event            Selection Committee       Anne-Laure Fayard , Associate Professor, School of Engineering; Faculty Advisor, Greenhouse   Lindsey Gray , Director, NYU Entrepreneurial Institute   Frank Rimalovski , Executive Director, NYU Entrepreneurial Institute                 Prototyping Fund Awardees \u2013 Spring 2015     - Cyber Chess: an educational and strategic board game that will educate users in cyber security.
