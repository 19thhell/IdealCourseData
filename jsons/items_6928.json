Billing itself as \u201cThe Sound of Young America,\u201d Motown established a lyrical and musical discourse through its records and albums that struck a responsive chord with white and black listeners alike. In this seminar we examine the race, gender and class identity that is inherent in\u2014and emerges from\u2014\u201cThe Motown Sound.\u201d How did this company exploit the nationalist pride in the African American community while simultaneously positioning itself as a \u201ccrossover\u201d enterprise to whites? What models of business and community did Motown emulate and create? And how did Motown affect the politics and racial discourse of its listeners? Our exploration situates Motown in the Detroit community of the 1950s and 1960s, to understand how it was \u201cimagined,\u201d and its impact on the wider culture.

At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture. Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging of some categories (i.e., male or heterosexual) over others, along with the social and political implications of such hierarchies. Our curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is often presented as \"natural\" or \"normal\" in traditional academic curricula.
