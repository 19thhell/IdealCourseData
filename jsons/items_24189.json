The online application for fall 2016 JD admission will be available September 1.   What are your JD application deadlines?     Regular Decision (Mid-April Decision): February 15   Early Decision (Late December Decision): November 15   Scholarships and Academic Scholars Program Applications: January 1     Does applying Early Decision increase my chances of admission?   No. Early Decision candidates are evaluated for admission according to the same selection criteria that apply to regular candidates. While their particular enthusiasm for the New York University School of Law as their first choice law school is considered by our Admissions Committee, Early Decision candidates do not enjoy significant advantage in the keenly competitive selection process. Some Early Decision applicants not offered admission in December will be placed on Hold and reviewed again in the spring as part of the Regular Decision pool; others not admitted in December will be informed that their application for admission has been denied and will not be evaluated again this year.   Is there any particular undergraduate coursework that the Committee on Admissions values highly?   The Committee looks for a broad range of courses, some of which are analytically demanding and others that require heavy reading loads and develop research and writing skills.   Is someone with a graduate degree at an advantage in applying to law school?   The Committee will give consideration to everything included in the application. An applicant holding a graduate degree does not necessarily have a competitive advantage over an applicant who does not have a graduate degree.   How does the Committee view a canceled LSAT score?   This has no impact on the evaluation of an application.   If I take the LSAT more than once, does the Committee see the higher score?   Yes, but they evaluate based on the average score in most cases. The Committee may take special circumstances into account. If a candidate can point out specific reasons why the Committee should consider an LSAT score aberrant, they should detail those reasons in an addendum to the personal statement.   What are the grade point averages and LSAT scores of your students?   For the fall 2014 entering class, the 75% and 25% are 3.87 and 3.56 for undergraduate GPA, and 172 and 167 for LSAT score, respectively.   Do you offer application fee waivers?   Applicants who have received an LSAC-approved LSAT or CAS fee waiver, will have their NYU School of Law $85 application fee automatically waived.     Applicants who are alumni of Teach for America or the Peace Corps are eligible for an $85 application fee waiver. To qualify, applicants must have completed their 2-year commitment to Teach for America or the Peace Corps by the start of the fall 2015 semester. Further, Teach for America alumni must have completed TFA's pre-corps training institute and served as a teacher for two years in a low-income community through their TFA placement. Applicants who have completed less than 2 years by the start of law school or those who are just entering Teach for America or the Peace Corps are not eligible. The application fee will also be waived for those who have served or are serving in the United States military. (Participation in a foreign country's military does not qualify an applicant for a fee waiver.)     Teach for America, Peace Corps and US military participants should send their request for a fee waiver to law.moreinfo@nyu.edu . Applicants must have an account with the LSAC. To request an application fee waiver, please include your L number as well as the basis for the waiver (Teach for America, Peace Corps, or US military Service).   Do you accept the February LSAT exam when applying for the fall 2016 semester?   Applicants must take the LSAT no later than December 2015 in order to apply to enter in the fall 2016 semester.   What is the oldest LSAT score you will accept in order to apply for the fall 2016 semester?   The oldest score we will accept in order to apply for fall 2015 is the June 2011 LSAT score.   How does the Committee view pass/fail grades on transcripts?   T he Committee considers the circumstances; were such courses required or optional, how many and in which subjects are such grades, etc. Please include any narratives or course evaluations of such transcripts with your application if they are available.   How many letters of recommendation do you require?   Two letters of recommendation are required to complete your application. Candidates applying for the Root-Tilden-Kern and related scholarships must submit at least one additional recommendation that addresses the candidate's commitment to public service.   By what method may I submit a recommendation?   NYU School of Law does not use a recommendation form. The Committee on Admissions prefers the use of the LSAC Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Service.   If I have been out of school for a while, from whom should I get letters of recommendation?   A professor or an employer or anyone who can speak to your ability to succeed in a rigorous law school program. Academic letters on file that are several years old may be helpful to the Committee as well.   Do you grant interviews for admissions?   Interviews and/or meetings with members of the Committee on Admissions are not granted at any point during the application process. Applicants are encouraged to consult published and online NYU School of Law informational resources for answers to their questions. Concerns that are not addressed in the aforementioned resources should be mailed to the attention of the Committee on Admissions.   If I am a foreign educated applicant, how can I submit my transcripts?   Foreign transcripts must be submitted through the LSAC Credential Assembly Service. Applicants who completed any post-secondary work outside of the US (including its territories) or Canada, must use this service for the evaluation of foreign transcripts. The one exception to this requirement is foreign work completed through a study abroad, consortium, or exchange program sponsored by a US or Canadian institution, and where the work is clearly indicated as such on the home campus transcript. Please visit www.lsac.org for details. Foreign applicants must take the LSAT however, foreign applicants to the JD program need not take the TOEFL. Foreign-trained lawyers should apply for the LLM Program.   Do you have a part-time or evening JD program?   No.   How can I reapply to NYU School of Law?   If a candidate previously applied to the Law School and has decided to reapply for the fall 2016 admissions cycle the candidate must complete the fall 2016 application form (including the personal statement and a letter of recommendation). You must also pay the appropriate application fee, register with the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and send updated transcripts to LSAC for all academic work (undergraduate, graduate and/or professional) undertaken since your last application. Please note that the Law School Admissions Council has extended its service to applicants for five years requiring a $25.00 report fee to have the LSAT score report and undergraduate transcripts sent through Credential Assembly Service to the NYU School of Law. For more information, visit www.lsac.org   Can I enroll in the spring?   No.   What is the average age of an NYU School of Law student?   For the fall 2013 entering class, approximately 70% of the students had taken at least one year off prior to entering law school. Approximately 12% of the students had been out of college for five years or more. The average age of the students in last year\u2019s entering class was 24.   Do you have a minority recruiter or recruitment program?   NYU School of Law is committed to recruiting a diverse student body. That commitment is a significant aspect of all recruitment efforts.   Where do NYU School of Law students live?   NYU School of Law has two residences in which law students, their spouses or partners and their children live. In most years, we have been able to provide housing for all incoming students who request it. For more information, please visit the Department of Residential Services website.   What are your office hours?   You are welcome to visit the New York University School of Law anytime during regular business hours. To obtain a visitor's pass and gain access to all Law School buildings, please first visit the Office of Admissions Welcome Desk located in the lobby of Wilf Hall. Prospective students/visitors should bring a driver's license or other form of photo identification. During your visit you may take a self-guided tour and/or observe classes while they are in session.   Does your office offer guided tours of the campus?   NYU School of Law currently offers tours of the campus during the fall semester only following each JD information session.

The online application for fall 2016 JD admission will be available September 1.   What are your JD application deadlines?     Regular Decision (Mid-April Decision): February 15   Early Decision (Late December Decision): November 15   Scholarships and Academic Scholars Program Applications: January 1     Does applying Early Decision increase my chances of admission?   No. Early Decision candidates are evaluated for admission according to the same selection criteria that apply to regular candidates. While their particular enthusiasm for the New York University School of Law as their first choice law school is considered by our Admissions Committee, Early Decision candidates do not enjoy significant advantage in the keenly competitive selection process. Some Early Decision applicants not offered admission in December will be placed on Hold and reviewed again in the spring as part of the Regular Decision pool; others not admitted in December will be informed that their application for admission has been denied and will not be evaluated again this year.   Is there any particular undergraduate coursework that the Committee on Admissions values highly?   The Committee looks for a broad range of courses, some of which are analytically demanding and others that require heavy reading loads and develop research and writing skills.   Is someone with a graduate degree at an advantage in applying to law school?   The Committee will give consideration to everything included in the application. An applicant holding a graduate degree does not necessarily have a competitive advantage over an applicant who does not have a graduate degree.   How does the Committee view a canceled LSAT score?   This has no impact on the evaluation of an application.   If I take the LSAT more than once, does the Committee see the higher score?   Yes, but they evaluate based on the average score in most cases. The Committee may take special circumstances into account. If a candidate can point out specific reasons why the Committee should consider an LSAT score aberrant, they should detail those reasons in an addendum to the personal statement.   What are the grade point averages and LSAT scores of your students?   For the fall 2014 entering class, the 75% and 25% are 3.87 and 3.56 for undergraduate GPA, and 172 and 167 for LSAT score, respectively.   Do you offer application fee waivers?   Applicants who have received an LSAC-approved LSAT or CAS fee waiver, will have their NYU School of Law $85 application fee automatically waived.     Applicants who are alumni of Teach for America or the Peace Corps are eligible for an $85 application fee waiver. To qualify, applicants must have completed their 2-year commitment to Teach for America or the Peace Corps by the start of the fall 2015 semester. Further, Teach for America alumni must have completed TFA's pre-corps training institute and served as a teacher for two years in a low-income community through their TFA placement. Applicants who have completed less than 2 years by the start of law school or those who are just entering Teach for America or the Peace Corps are not eligible. The application fee will also be waived for those who have served or are serving in the United States military. (Participation in a foreign country's military does not qualify an applicant for a fee waiver.)     Teach for America, Peace Corps and US military participants should send their request for a fee waiver to law.moreinfo@nyu.edu . Applicants must have an account with the LSAC. To request an application fee waiver, please include your L number as well as the basis for the waiver (Teach for America, Peace Corps, or US military Service).   Do you accept the February LSAT exam when applying for the fall 2016 semester?   Applicants must take the LSAT no later than December 2015 in order to apply to enter in the fall 2016 semester.   What is the oldest LSAT score you will accept in order to apply for the fall 2016 semester?   The oldest score we will accept in order to apply for fall 2015 is the June 2011 LSAT score.   How does the Committee view pass/fail grades on transcripts?   T he Committee considers the circumstances; were such courses required or optional, how many and in which subjects are such grades, etc. Please include any narratives or course evaluations of such transcripts with your application if they are available.   How many letters of recommendation do you require?   Two letters of recommendation are required to complete your application. Candidates applying for the Root-Tilden-Kern and related scholarships must submit at least one additional recommendation that addresses the candidate's commitment to public service.   By what method may I submit a recommendation?   NYU School of Law does not use a recommendation form. The Committee on Admissions prefers the use of the LSAC Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Service.   If I have been out of school for a while, from whom should I get letters of recommendation?   A professor or an employer or anyone who can speak to your ability to succeed in a rigorous law school program. Academic letters on file that are several years old may be helpful to the Committee as well.   Do you grant interviews for admissions?   Interviews and/or meetings with members of the Committee on Admissions are not granted at any point during the application process. Applicants are encouraged to consult published and online NYU School of Law informational resources for answers to their questions. Concerns that are not addressed in the aforementioned resources should be mailed to the attention of the Committee on Admissions.   If I am a foreign educated applicant, how can I submit my transcripts?   Foreign transcripts must be submitted through the LSAC Credential Assembly Service. Applicants who completed any post-secondary work outside of the US (including its territories) or Canada, must use this service for the evaluation of foreign transcripts. The one exception to this requirement is foreign work completed through a study abroad, consortium, or exchange program sponsored by a US or Canadian institution, and where the work is clearly indicated as such on the home campus transcript. Please visit www.lsac.org for details. Foreign applicants must take the LSAT however, foreign applicants to the JD program need not take the TOEFL. Foreign-trained lawyers should apply for the LLM Program.   Do you have a part-time or evening JD program?   No.   How can I reapply to NYU School of Law?   If a candidate previously applied to the Law School and has decided to reapply for the fall 2016 admissions cycle the candidate must complete the fall 2016 application form (including the personal statement and a letter of recommendation). You must also pay the appropriate application fee, register with the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and send updated transcripts to LSAC for all academic work (undergraduate, graduate and/or professional) undertaken since your last application. Please note that the Law School Admissions Council has extended its service to applicants for five years requiring a $25.00 report fee to have the LSAT score report and undergraduate transcripts sent through Credential Assembly Service to the NYU School of Law. For more information, visit www.lsac.org   Can I enroll in the spring?   No.   What is the average age of an NYU School of Law student?   For the fall 2013 entering class, approximately 70% of the students had taken at least one year off prior to entering law school. Approximately 12% of the students had been out of college for five years or more. The average age of the students in last year\u2019s entering class was 24.   Do you have a minority recruiter or recruitment program?   NYU School of Law is committed to recruiting a diverse student body. That commitment is a significant aspect of all recruitment efforts.   Where do NYU School of Law students live?   NYU School of Law has two residences in which law students, their spouses or partners and their children live. In most years, we have been able to provide housing for all incoming students who request it. For more information, please visit the Department of Residential Services website.   What are your office hours?   You are welcome to visit the New York University School of Law anytime during regular business hours. To obtain a visitor's pass and gain access to all Law School buildings, please first visit the Office of Admissions Welcome Desk located in the lobby of Wilf Hall. Prospective students/visitors should bring a driver's license or other form of photo identification. During your visit you may take a self-guided tour and/or observe classes while they are in session.   Does your office offer guided tours of the campus?   NYU School of Law currently offers tours of the campus during the fall semester only following each JD information session. You are also welcome to visit the Welcome Desk during our office hours to obtain a Self-Guided Tour which will allow you to explore our campus on your own.   How much is tuition?   Tuition for the 2014-2015 academic year is $55,330. Information on the typical student expense budget is also available.   Where do I find out about the Paralegal Studies Program?   Please contact the NYU School of Professional Studies at (212) 790-1320.   How can I make sure that my application is complete and can I check the status of my application?   (Please note that we have an online status check function available for all applicants accessible here .) The Office of Admissions will try to keep you informed about the status of your application by notifying you if any of the material necessary to complete your application is missing. However, it takes time for the committee to give each application due consideration. Also, please note that it is common for some time to pass, up to and including a few weeks, between the receipt of an application and the request of a CAS report. To avoid any problems or delays please be sure to assemble as many parts of your application as possible and submit them together, when calling the Office of Admissions please identify yourself as an JD applicant, and keep a copy of your application and supporting material since we will not return any part of your application. Lastly, the Office of Admissions will not release any information to anyone except the applicant. Further, the Office of Admissions does not give admissions decisions by email, telephone or fax.

Early Decision (Binding)   File and complete application by November 15  Notification by late December   If you wish to be considered for Early Decision admission, your application, Early Decision Contract, and all supporting materials, other than your Law School Credential Assembly service (CAS) report, must be received by November 15. However, your CAS report must be complete and ready to be requested by our office no later than November 15. Applicants must take the Law School Admission Test no later than October 2014.   Applicants who apply for Early Decision but do not meet the Early Decision deadline will automatically have their applications considered for regular admission.   If you wish to be considered for Early Decision admission after you have submitted your online application, please complete the Early Decision Contract . The completed contract should be faxed, scanned and emailed, or mailed to:   New York University School of Law  Office of J.D Admissions  Wilf Hall  139 MacDougal Street  New York, NY 10012  Fax (212)995-4527  Email law.moreinfo@nyu.edu   Admission during Early Decision is binding on applicants. You must indicate your intention to apply for Early Decision on your application. You may not apply for another binding early decision program. If admitted, you must enroll at the Law School and immediately withdraw all applications at other law schools regardless of your status. Failure to honor these commitments will result in New York University School of Law revoking its offer of admission. As an Early Decision applicant, you will be informed by the end of December whether your application has been accepted, denied or held for further review. If your application is held, it will be considered again in the Regular Decision cycle.   Regular Decision   File and complete application by February 15  Notification by late April   Applicants who complete applications by February 15 will receive decisions \u2014 admit, deny, or wait list \u2014 by late April. Your CAS report must be complete and ready to be requested by our office by February 15.   If your application is not complete by February 15, we will try to respond within twelve weeks of its completion, but we cannot guarantee a decision by a particular date. Please note that the Committee on Admissions may choose to return applications filed after the February 15 deadline.   Applicants must take the LSAT no later than December 2015. The oldest score we will accept is from the June 2011 LSAT administration.   Final decisions for some of those placed on the waitlist may not be made until late summer.   Applicants who wish to be considered for the following School of Law's Scholarship Programs must complete their application by January 1 and must have a complete law school report ready to be requested by the Office of Admissions no later than January 1: AnBryce Scholarship Program, ASPIRE Cybersecurity Scholarship, Bickel &amp; Brewer Latino Institute for Human Rights Scholarship, Furman Academic Scholars Program, Furman Public Policy Scholarship, International Institute for Law and Justice Scholarship Program, Mitchell Jacobson Leadership Program in Law &amp; Business, and the Root-Tilden-Kern Public Interest Scholarship Program.

The online application for fall 2016 JD admission will be available September 1.   What are your JD application deadlines?     Regular Decision (Mid-April Decision): February 15   Early Decision (Late December Decision): November 15   Scholarships and Academic Scholars Program Applications: January 1     Does applying Early Decision increase my chances of admission?   No. Early Decision candidates are evaluated for admission according to the same selection criteria that apply to regular candidates. While their particular enthusiasm for the New York University School of Law as their first choice law school is considered by our Admissions Committee, Early Decision candidates do not enjoy significant advantage in the keenly competitive selection process. Some Early Decision applicants not offered admission in December will be placed on Hold and reviewed again in the spring as part of the Regular Decision pool; others not admitted in December will be informed that their application for admission has been denied and will not be evaluated again this year.   Is there any particular undergraduate coursework that the Committee on Admissions values highly?   The Committee looks for a broad range of courses, some of which are analytically demanding and others that require heavy reading loads and develop research and writing skills.   Is someone with a graduate degree at an advantage in applying to law school?   The Committee will give consideration to everything included in the application. An applicant holding a graduate degree does not necessarily have a competitive advantage over an applicant who does not have a graduate degree.   How does the Committee view a canceled LSAT score?   This has no impact on the evaluation of an application.   If I take the LSAT more than once, does the Committee see the higher score?   Yes, but they evaluate based on the average score in most cases. The Committee may take special circumstances into account. If a candidate can point out specific reasons why the Committee should consider an LSAT score aberrant, they should detail those reasons in an addendum to the personal statement.   What are the grade point averages and LSAT scores of your students?   For the fall 2014 entering class, the 75% and 25% are 3.87 and 3.56 for undergraduate GPA, and 172 and 167 for LSAT score, respectively.   Do you offer application fee waivers?   Applicants who have received an LSAC-approved LSAT or CAS fee waiver, will have their NYU School of Law $85 application fee automatically waived.     Applicants who are alumni of Teach for America or the Peace Corps are eligible for an $85 application fee waiver. To qualify, applicants must have completed their 2-year commitment to Teach for America or the Peace Corps by the start of the fall 2015 semester. Further, Teach for America alumni must have completed TFA's pre-corps training institute and served as a teacher for two years in a low-income community through their TFA placement. Applicants who have completed less than 2 years by the start of law school or those who are just entering Teach for America or the Peace Corps are not eligible. The application fee will also be waived for those who have served or are serving in the United States military. (Participation in a foreign country's military does not qualify an applicant for a fee waiver.)     Teach for America, Peace Corps and US military participants should send their request for a fee waiver to law.moreinfo@nyu.edu . Applicants must have an account with the LSAC. To request an application fee waiver, please include your L number as well as the basis for the waiver (Teach for America, Peace Corps, or US military Service).   Do you accept the February LSAT exam when applying for the fall 2016 semester?   Applicants must take the LSAT no later than December 2015 in order to apply to enter in the fall 2016 semester.   What is the oldest LSAT score you will accept in order to apply for the fall 2016 semester?   The oldest score we will accept in order to apply for fall 2015 is the June 2011 LSAT score.   How does the Committee view pass/fail grades on transcripts?   T he Committee considers the circumstances; were such courses required or optional, how many and in which subjects are such grades, etc. Please include any narratives or course evaluations of such transcripts with your application if they are available.   How many letters of recommendation do you require?   Two letters of recommendation are required to complete your application. Candidates applying for the Root-Tilden-Kern and related scholarships must submit at least one additional recommendation that addresses the candidate's commitment to public service.   By what method may I submit a recommendation?   NYU School of Law does not use a recommendation form. The Committee on Admissions prefers the use of the LSAC Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Service.   If I have been out of school for a while, from whom should I get letters of recommendation?   A professor or an employer or anyone who can speak to your ability to succeed in a rigorous law school program. Academic letters on file that are several years old may be helpful to the Committee as well.   Do you grant interviews for admissions?   Interviews and/or meetings with members of the Committee on Admissions are not granted at any point during the application process. Applicants are encouraged to consult published and online NYU School of Law informational resources for answers to their questions. Concerns that are not addressed in the aforementioned resources should be mailed to the attention of the Committee on Admissions.   If I am a foreign educated applicant, how can I submit my transcripts?   Foreign transcripts must be submitted through the LSAC Credential Assembly Service. Applicants who completed any post-secondary work outside of the US (including its territories) or Canada, must use this service for the evaluation of foreign transcripts. The one exception to this requirement is foreign work completed through a study abroad, consortium, or exchange program sponsored by a US or Canadian institution, and where the work is clearly indicated as such on the home campus transcript. Please visit www.lsac.org for details. Foreign applicants must take the LSAT however, foreign applicants to the JD program need not take the TOEFL. Foreign-trained lawyers should apply for the LLM Program.   Do you have a part-time or evening JD program?   No.   How can I reapply to NYU School of Law?   If a candidate previously applied to the Law School and has decided to reapply for the fall 2016 admissions cycle the candidate must complete the fall 2016 application form (including the personal statement and a letter of recommendation). You must also pay the appropriate application fee, register with the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and send updated transcripts to LSAC for all academic work (undergraduate, graduate and/or professional) undertaken since your last application. Please note that the Law School Admissions Council has extended its service to applicants for five years requiring a $25.00 report fee to have the LSAT score report and undergraduate transcripts sent through Credential Assembly Service to the NYU School of Law. For more information, visit www.lsac.org   Can I enroll in the spring?   No.   What is the average age of an NYU School of Law student?   For the fall 2013 entering class, approximately 70% of the students had taken at least one year off prior to entering law school. Approximately 12% of the students had been out of college for five years or more. The average age of the students in last year\u2019s entering class was 24.   Do you have a minority recruiter or recruitment program?   NYU School of Law is committed to recruiting a diverse student body. That commitment is a significant aspect of all recruitment efforts.   Where do NYU School of Law students live?   NYU School of Law has two residences in which law students, their spouses or partners and their children live. In most years, we have been able to provide housing for all incoming students who request it. For more information, please visit the Department of Residential Services website.   What are your office hours?   You are welcome to visit the New York University School of Law anytime during regular business hours. To obtain a visitor's pass and gain access to all Law School buildings, please first visit the Office of Admissions Welcome Desk located in the lobby of Wilf Hall. Prospective students/visitors should bring a driver's license or other form of photo identification. During your visit you may take a self-guided tour and/or observe classes while they are in session.   Does your office offer guided tours of the campus?   NYU School of Law currently offers tours of the campus during the fall semester only following each JD information session. You are also welcome to visit the Welcome Desk during our office hours to obtain a Self-Guided Tour which will allow you to explore our campus on your own.   How much is tuition?   Tuition for the 2014-2015 academic year is $55,330. Information on the typical student expense budget is also available.   Where do I find out about the Paralegal Studies Program?   Please contact the NYU School of Professional Studies at (212) 790-1320.   How can I make sure that my application is complete and can I check the status of my application?   (Please note that we have an online status check function available for all applicants accessible here .) The Office of Admissions will try to keep you informed about the status of your application by notifying you if any of the material necessary to complete your application is missing. However, it takes time for the committee to give each application due consideration. Also, please note that it is common for some time to pass, up to and including a few weeks, between the receipt of an application and the request of a CAS report. To avoid any problems or delays please be sure to assemble as many parts of your application as possible and submit them together, when calling the Office of Admissions please identify yourself as an JD applicant, and keep a copy of your application and supporting material since we will not return any part of your application. Lastly, the Office of Admissions will not release any information to anyone except the applicant. Further, the Office of Admissions does not give admissions decisions by email, telephone or fax. This policy helps to protect the confidentiality of every applicant.

However, your CAS report must be complete and ready to be requested by our office no later than November 15. Applicants must take the Law School Admission Test no later than October 2014.   Applicants who apply for Early Decision but do not meet the Early Decision deadline will automatically have their applications considered for regular admission.   If you wish to be considered for Early Decision admission after you have submitted your online application, please complete the Early Decision Contract . The completed contract should be faxed, scanned and emailed, or mailed to:   New York University School of Law  Office of J.D Admissions  Wilf Hall  139 MacDougal Street  New York, NY 10012  Fax (212)995-4527  Email law.moreinfo@nyu.edu   Admission during Early Decision is binding on applicants. You must indicate your intention to apply for Early Decision on your application. You may not apply for another binding early decision program. If admitted, you must enroll at the Law School and immediately withdraw all applications at other law schools regardless of your status. Failure to honor these commitments will result in New York University School of Law revoking its offer of admission. As an Early Decision applicant, you will be informed by the end of December whether your application has been accepted, denied or held for further review.

The online application for fall 2016 JD admission will be available September 1.   What are your JD application deadlines?     Regular Decision (Mid-April Decision): February 15   Early Decision (Late December Decision): November 15   Scholarships and Academic Scholars Program Applications: January 1     Does applying Early Decision increase my chances of admission?   No. Early Decision candidates are evaluated for admission according to the same selection criteria that apply to regular candidates. While their particular enthusiasm for the New York University School of Law as their first choice law school is considered by our Admissions Committee, Early Decision candidates do not enjoy significant advantage in the keenly competitive selection process. Some Early Decision applicants not offered admission in December will be placed on Hold and reviewed again in the spring as part of the Regular Decision pool; others not admitted in December will be informed that their application for admission has been denied and will not be evaluated again this year.   Is there any particular undergraduate coursework that the Committee on Admissions values highly?   The Committee looks for a broad range of courses, some of which are analytically demanding and others that require heavy reading loads and develop research and writing skills.   Is someone with a graduate degree at an advantage in applying to law school?   The Committee will give consideration to everything included in the application. An applicant holding a graduate degree does not necessarily have a competitive advantage over an applicant who does not have a graduate degree.   How does the Committee view a canceled LSAT score?   This has no impact on the evaluation of an application.   If I take the LSAT more than once, does the Committee see the higher score?   Yes, but they evaluate based on the average score in most cases. The Committee may take special circumstances into account. If a candidate can point out specific reasons why the Committee should consider an LSAT score aberrant, they should detail those reasons in an addendum to the personal statement.   What are the grade point averages and LSAT scores of your students?   For the fall 2014 entering class, the 75% and 25% are 3.87 and 3.56 for undergraduate GPA, and 172 and 167 for LSAT score, respectively.   Do you offer application fee waivers?   Applicants who have received an LSAC-approved LSAT or CAS fee waiver, will have their NYU School of Law $85 application fee automatically waived.     Applicants who are alumni of Teach for America or the Peace Corps are eligible for an $85 application fee waiver. To qualify, applicants must have completed their 2-year commitment to Teach for America or the Peace Corps by the start of the fall 2015 semester. Further, Teach for America alumni must have completed TFA's pre-corps training institute and served as a teacher for two years in a low-income community through their TFA placement. Applicants who have completed less than 2 years by the start of law school or those who are just entering Teach for America or the Peace Corps are not eligible. The application fee will also be waived for those who have served or are serving in the United States military. (Participation in a foreign country's military does not qualify an applicant for a fee waiver.)     Teach for America, Peace Corps and US military participants should send their request for a fee waiver to law.moreinfo@nyu.edu . Applicants must have an account with the LSAC. To request an application fee waiver, please include your L number as well as the basis for the waiver (Teach for America, Peace Corps, or US military Service).   Do you accept the February LSAT exam when applying for the fall 2016 semester?   Applicants must take the LSAT no later than December 2015 in order to apply to enter in the fall 2016 semester.   What is the oldest LSAT score you will accept in order to apply for the fall 2016 semester?   The oldest score we will accept in order to apply for fall 2015 is the June 2011 LSAT score.   How does the Committee view pass/fail grades on transcripts?   T he Committee considers the circumstances; were such courses required or optional, how many and in which subjects are such grades, etc. Please include any narratives or course evaluations of such transcripts with your application if they are available.   How many letters of recommendation do you require?   Two letters of recommendation are required to complete your application. Candidates applying for the Root-Tilden-Kern and related scholarships must submit at least one additional recommendation that addresses the candidate's commitment to public service.   By what method may I submit a recommendation?   NYU School of Law does not use a recommendation form. The Committee on Admissions prefers the use of the LSAC Letter of Recommendation (LOR) Service.   If I have been out of school for a while, from whom should I get letters of recommendation?   A professor or an employer or anyone who can speak to your ability to succeed in a rigorous law school program. Academic letters on file that are several years old may be helpful to the Committee as well.   Do you grant interviews for admissions?   Interviews and/or meetings with members of the Committee on Admissions are not granted at any point during the application process. Applicants are encouraged to consult published and online NYU School of Law informational resources for answers to their questions. Concerns that are not addressed in the aforementioned resources should be mailed to the attention of the Committee on Admissions.   If I am a foreign educated applicant, how can I submit my transcripts?   Foreign transcripts must be submitted through the LSAC Credential Assembly Service. Applicants who completed any post-secondary work outside of the US (including its territories) or Canada, must use this service for the evaluation of foreign transcripts. The one exception to this requirement is foreign work completed through a study abroad, consortium, or exchange program sponsored by a US or Canadian institution, and where the work is clearly indicated as such on the home campus transcript. Please visit www.lsac.org for details. Foreign applicants must take the LSAT however, foreign applicants to the JD program need not take the TOEFL. Foreign-trained lawyers should apply for the LLM Program.   Do you have a part-time or evening JD program?   No.   How can I reapply to NYU School of Law?   If a candidate previously applied to the Law School and has decided to reapply for the fall 2016 admissions cycle the candidate must complete the fall 2016 application form (including the personal statement and a letter of recommendation). You must also pay the appropriate application fee, register with the Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and send updated transcripts to LSAC for all academic work (undergraduate, graduate and/or professional) undertaken since your last application. Please note that the Law School Admissions Council has extended its service to applicants for five years requiring a $25.00 report fee to have the LSAT score report and undergraduate transcripts sent through Credential Assembly Service to the NYU School of Law. For more information, visit www.lsac.org   Can I enroll in the spring?   No.   What is the average age of an NYU School of Law student?   For the fall 2013 entering class, approximately 70% of the students had taken at least one year off prior to entering law school. Approximately 12% of the students had been out of college for five years or more. The average age of the students in last year\u2019s entering class was 24.   Do you have a minority recruiter or recruitment program?   NYU School of Law is committed to recruiting a diverse student body. That commitment is a significant aspect of all recruitment efforts.   Where do NYU School of Law students live?   NYU School of Law has two residences in which law students, their spouses or partners and their children live. In most years, we have been able to provide housing for all incoming students who request it. For more information, please visit the Department of Residential Services website.   What are your office hours?   You are welcome to visit the New York University School of Law anytime during regular business hours. To obtain a visitor's pass and gain access to all Law School buildings, please first visit the Office of Admissions Welcome Desk located in the lobby of Wilf Hall. Prospective students/visitors should bring a driver's license or other form of photo identification. During your visit you may take a self-guided tour and/or observe classes while they are in session.   Does your office offer guided tours of the campus?   NYU School of Law currently offers tours of the campus during the fall semester only following each JD information session. You are also welcome to visit the Welcome Desk during our office hours to obtain a Self-Guided Tour which will allow you to explore our campus on your own.   How much is tuition?   Tuition for the 2014-2015 academic year is $55,330. Information on the typical student expense budget is also available.   Where do I find out about the Paralegal Studies Program?   Please contact the NYU School of Professional Studies at (212) 790-1320.   How can I make sure that my application is complete and can I check the status of my application?   (Please note that we have an online status check function available for all applicants accessible here .) The Office of Admissions will try to keep you informed about the status of your application by notifying you if any of the material necessary to complete your application is missing. However, it takes time for the committee to give each application due consideration. Also, please note that it is common for some time to pass, up to and including a few weeks, between the receipt of an application and the request of a CAS report. To avoid any problems or delays please be sure to assemble as many parts of your application as possible and submit them together, when calling the Office of Admissions please identify yourself as an JD applicant, and keep a copy of your application and supporting material since we will not return any part of your application. Lastly, the Office of Admissions will not release any information to anyone except the applicant. Further, the Office of Admissions does not give admissions decisions by email, telephone or fax. This policy helps to protect the confidentiality of every applicant.
