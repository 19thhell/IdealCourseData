The PSO\u2019s Business Process Improvement Team will conduct a detailed analysis of current and future state processes, and if necessary, facilitate visioning sessions, develop requirements and specifications and suggest other activities to improve how NYU delivers and operates administrative services and systems.   The PSO Business Process Improvement Team utilizes the DMAIC methodology (an abbreviation for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control), a widely-used method for improvement which features a logical set of phases from clarifying the issue and goal, to solidifying successful change.
