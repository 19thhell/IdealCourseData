The colloquium explores the place of Judaism and Christianity in the historical and social setting of the ancient world. The formative period for classical Judaism and the origins of Christianity unfolded in the wider setting of the cultures of ancient Greece, Rome, and Mesopotamia. Yet, Judaism and Christianity are often studied in isolation from this broader context. Scholars of Judaism and Christianity will examine the many ways that these two religions were shaped by the experience of living among these ancient civilizations.   Presentations include \u201cSelling Souls: Early Christians (and Their Neighbors) as Religious Entrepreneurs\u201d and \u201cPractices of Seeing God(s) in Late Antiquity\u201d as well as \u201cThe New Testament as a Source for the History of the Jews and Judaism,\u201d the keynote address by NYU\u2019s Lawrence Schiffman (March 26, 5:15 p.m.).   The full program may be viewed here .   The event is free and open to the public, which may call 212.992.7978 or email ancient.studies@nyu.edu for more information. Entry is on a first-come, first-served basis.
