Summary: \"These three collections consist of the British Government's files on the countries of South Asia from shortly before Indian partition and independence up to 1980. This was a turbulent era in the region's history. The partition of 1947 and the splitting apart of Pakistan in 1971 were accompanied by loss of life and enormous population movements, as refugees fled violence or ethnic conflict. India fought Pakistan twice in Kashmir, in 1947-8 and 1965, and China in the Himalayas in 1962. Stable and democratic government proved elusive outside India , the region experiencing a succession of coups: in Pakistan in 1958 and 1977, in Afghanistan in 1973, 1978 and 1979, and in Bangladesh in 1975; democracy underwent a flowering and then a withering in Nepal, where King Mahendra established a partyless autocracy in 1959. Even in India , which had successfully established a democratic, secular state at independence, the government of India Gandhi became increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent in the 1970s, imprisoning hundreds of opponents.... The files in this collection cover these events from the standpoint of British officialdom. In addition to high politics, the papers in the files cover such issues as economic and industrial development, trade, migration, visits to South Asia by British politicians and by South Asian politicians to Britain and elsewhere, education, administrative reorganisation, conflict over language, aid, political parties, agriculture and irrigation, and television and the press. Together they form a resource of fundamental value to scholars and students of modern South Asia.\"   Publisher: Marlborough, Wiltshire : Adam Matthew Digital   Language: English   Publication Date: c2011             Comments (0)                                              close                                                                                                          South Asia Documentaries@Bobst                                                                                  South Asia Documentary Screening Series@NYU                  Screening of Jahaji Bhai  (A 2002 documentary film directed by Suresh Pillai on South Asian histories of migration)        Wednesday, April 1, 2015 4:30 &ndash; 6:30 pm Institute for Public Knowledge 20 Cooper Square, 5 th Floor   Welcome &amp; Introduction by Aruna Magier (NYU).

In response, NYU&rsquo;s South Asia librarian, Aruna Magier , has been working with filmmakers, vendors, distributors and with the AFC librarian/staff to build a well-rounded collection of important documentaries from the countries of South Asia, across many thematic issues of current interest to our faculty. New items are being added to this growing collection all the time.   As part of this continuing effort, we also have started &lsquo;The South Asia Documentary Screening Series @ Bobst&rsquo; with the goal of engaging members of the NYU community in the exploration of interesting and important South Asian documentary films and to promote visibility and usage of these films. Whenever possible, the filmmakers are brought to the screenings to partipate in Q&amp;A sessions after the film with NYU's South Asian Studies community. Please check back here for announcements of upcoming screenings. Please join us for these events, and pass this announcement on to your colleagues and other students, and encourage them also to participate.

The focus of these oral histories consists of three main themes: &lsquo; roots and memory&rsquo; (dialogue between first and third generation on the history of Bangladesh and the 1971 war of independence); &lsquo; community creativity &rsquo; (dialogue between second and third generation on welfare and community involvement in the UK, from the 1970s-80s) and finally &lsquo; popular culture: between tradition and innovation &rsquo; (across three generations, mainly focussing on traditional and more recent British Bengali musical heritage, from the 1970s-80s).   Guide to the South Asian oral history collections at the International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam -- an oral history project by Shahriar Kabir, aimed at collecting the memories of political activists from different progressive and nationalist backgrounds. These memories are preserved in the form of extensive video recordings. Collection include 'living memories' going back to the Chittagong Armoury Raid of the 1930s. Interviews include the Bangladesh Liberation War, communist, labour, peasant, women, cultural, anti-colonial and nationalist movements from India ( Naxalite movement and the peasant uprisings of Telengana and Srikakulam) , Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Summary: \"These three collections consist of the British Government's files on the countries of South Asia from shortly before Indian partition and independence up to 1980. This was a turbulent era in the region's history. The partition of 1947 and the splitting apart of Pakistan in 1971 were accompanied by loss of life and enormous population movements, as refugees fled violence or ethnic conflict. India fought Pakistan twice in Kashmir, in 1947-8 and 1965, and China in the Himalayas in 1962. Stable and democratic government proved elusive outside India , the region experiencing a succession of coups: in Pakistan in 1958 and 1977, in Afghanistan in 1973, 1978 and 1979, and in Bangladesh in 1975; democracy underwent a flowering and then a withering in Nepal, where King Mahendra established a partyless autocracy in 1959. Even in India , which had successfully established a democratic, secular state at independence, the government of India Gandhi became increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent in the 1970s, imprisoning hundreds of opponents.... The files in this collection cover these events from the standpoint of British officialdom. In addition to high politics, the papers in the files cover such issues as economic and industrial development, trade, migration, visits to South Asia by British politicians and by South Asian politicians to Britain and elsewhere, education, administrative reorganisation, conflict over language, aid, political parties, agriculture and irrigation, and television and the press. Together they form a resource of fundamental value to scholars and students of modern South Asia.\"   Publisher: Marlborough, Wiltshire : Adam Matthew Digital   Language: English   Publication Date: c2011             Comments (0)                                              close                                                                                                          South Asia Documentaries@Bobst                                                                                  South Asia Documentary Screening Series@NYU                  Screening of Jahaji Bhai  (A 2002 documentary film directed by Suresh Pillai on South Asian histories of migration)        Wednesday, April 1, 2015 4:30 &ndash; 6:30 pm Institute for Public Knowledge 20 Cooper Square, 5 th Floor   Welcome &amp; Introduction by Aruna Magier (NYU).

In response, NYU&rsquo;s South Asia librarian, Aruna Magier , has been working with filmmakers, vendors, distributors and with the AFC librarian/staff to build a well-rounded collection of important documentaries from the countries of South Asia, across many thematic issues of current interest to our faculty. New items are being added to this growing collection all the time.   As part of this continuing effort, we also have started &lsquo;The South Asia Documentary Screening Series @ Bobst&rsquo; with the goal of engaging members of the NYU community in the exploration of interesting and important South Asian documentary films and to promote visibility and usage of these films. Whenever possible, the filmmakers are brought to the screenings to partipate in Q&amp;A sessions after the film with NYU's South Asian Studies community. Please check back here for announcements of upcoming screenings. Please join us for these events, and pass this announcement on to your colleagues and other students, and encourage them also to participate.

This is an oral history partnership project between Swadhinata Trust and CRONEM (Centre for Research on Nationalism, Ethnicity &amp; Multiculturalism, University of Surrey) encouraging  young Bengali people to research, document and celebrate Bengali history, community creativity and socio-cultural heritage by recording and voicing three generations&rsquo; experience of being Bengali in multicultural Britain. The focus of these oral histories consists of three main themes: &lsquo; roots and memory&rsquo; (dialogue between first and third generation on the history of Bangladesh and the 1971 war of independence); &lsquo; community creativity &rsquo; (dialogue between second and third generation on welfare and community involvement in the UK, from the 1970s-80s) and finally &lsquo; popular culture: between tradition and innovation &rsquo; (across three generations, mainly focussing on traditional and more recent British Bengali musical heritage, from the 1970s-80s).   Guide to the South Asian oral history collections at the International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam -- an oral history project by Shahriar Kabir, aimed at collecting the memories of political activists from different progressive and nationalist backgrounds.
