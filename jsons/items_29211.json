In fact, their needs are more varied and meeting those needs may take some creativity on your part. School-age child care services may be needed for before-school, after-school, and during holiday/vacation days, and summer vacation weeks.   There are several options one might consider when scheduling your child's out-of-school time including:     Hire your child's regular care provider for additional hours and days;   Talk with other parents about sharing care, trading play dates, etc.   Hire a responsible high school, college student, or adult to care for your child alone or with a friend or two;   Determine if your child's school offers an organized program;   Determine if your local library or museum offers a special program or activity.   Explore and enroll your child in a special holiday/vacation camp program .       NYC School-Age Child Care Licensing Regulations     In New York City school-age services are a licensed form of care.

In fact, their needs are more varied and meeting those needs may take some creativity on your part. School-age child care services may be needed for before-school, after-school, and during holiday/vacation days, and summer vacation weeks.   There are several options one might consider when scheduling your child's out-of-school time including:     Hire your child's regular care provider for additional hours and days;   Talk with other parents about sharing care, trading play dates, etc.   Hire a responsible high school, college student, or adult to care for your child alone or with a friend or two;   Determine if your child's school offers an organized program;   Determine if your local library or museum offers a special program or activity.   Explore and enroll your child in a special holiday/vacation camp program .       NYC School-Age Child Care Licensing Regulations     In New York City school-age services are a licensed form of care.

NYU offers a number of valuable retirement benefits plans to its employees. The Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity (STDA) Plan is available to all employees. The NYU Retirement Plan and the 457(b) Plan are available to eligible full-time Faculty, Administrators and Research Staff. The Staff Pension Plan is available to all Office &amp; Clerical (Local 3882), Laboratory &amp; Technical (Local 3882), and Service Employees (Local 1, Local 810). Participation in these plans provides an excellent opportunity for you to build a financially secure future.                                                                                                                                                                            What is the Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity (STDA) Plan and when can I participate?                                                       The Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity (STDA) Plan is a savings investment program that allows you to defer taxes and save money at the same time. The Plan is a defined contribution plan under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.   The STDA Plan is available to all employees beginning on their first day of employment. Participation in the plan is voluntary and funded completely by your own contributions. There is no waiting period and you can join at any time during the year.                                                                                                                                                                             How does the STDA Plan work?                                                        You decide how much you want to save, up to the IRS maximum, and you choose the investment funds in which contributions to your account will be invested. A wide array of choices are available, so that you can choose the investments that are right for you. (See also, &quot;How much can I contribute to a 403(b) Plan?&quot; below)   You contribute to your account through pre-tax salary reductions. This means that your contributions are taken out of your pay before taxes are calculated, thus reducing current taxable income. (See also, &quot;A Note on Tax-Deferred Contributions and State Practices&quot; below.)   The University has selected TIAA-CREF and the Vanguard Group to offer as investment options under the Plan. When you join the Plan, you choose the investment funds in which contributions to your account will be invested. You can choose to invest your entire account in one fund, or you can spread your investments among several funds. You do not pay Federal, New York State or New York City taxes on the money you save or the earnings on your investments until you withdraw the money, or you begin receiving a regular monthly annuity payout.   If you are not participating in the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan and would like to join, contact NYU PeopleLink at askpeoplelink@nyu.edu or 212-992-LINK (5465). If you choose to participate, NYU will deduct the amount that you elect to contribute from your pay and invest it on your behalf into the investment option or options that you choose from among the available alternatives.                                                                                                                                                                            Am I eligible to take a hardship distribution from the NYU retirement plans?                                                           Hardship distributions from the NYU Retirement Plan are not allowed. You may be eligible to take a hardship distribution of part or all of your NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan contributions only (excluding investment earnings). A withdrawal shall be available only in the event of an immediate and heavy financial need arising from:     The purchase of your principal residence (excluding mortgage payments);   Tuition and related educational fees for the next twelve (12) months of post high school education for you, your spouse, your child, or dependent claimed on your income tax return.   Avoidance of eviction or mortgage foreclosure in connection with your principal residence.   Uninsured medical expenses incurred or to be incurred by you, your spouse, or a dependent you claim on your tax return.   Payments for burial or funeral expenses for your deceased parent, spouse, children, or dependents.   Expenses for the repair of damage to your principal residence that would qualify for a casualty deduction such as fire, flood, storms including hurricanes, and tornadoes.     There are no situations other than those listed above which constitute a hardship under the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan. In addition, hardship distributions are only available from TIAA-CREF. The STDA Plan requires that you exhaust your maximum loan available before being eligible for a hardship distribution. If your STDA Plan is invested with Vanguard, you must transfer your investments to TIAA-CREF before a loan and hardship distribution would be available to you.   TIAA-CREF will require such documentation as it deems necessary to support a Participant's assertion of a financial hardship. If a distribution is approved, your NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan contribution will be stopped and you will not be permitted to resume contributions for six months from the date your hardship was approved. You must complete a new Salary Reduction Election Form to begin your contribution after the six month suspension period ends. Contact TIAA-CREF at 800-842-2776 for more information.                                                                                                                                                                         A Note on Tax-Deferred Contributions and State Practices:                                                       Your contributions to the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan (a 403b plan) are taken from your paycheck before Federal and state taxes are calculated.   State tax laws, however, can differ from state to state. New York State and New York City do not currently tax your individual contributions. However, New Jersey and Pennsylvania consider your contributions to a 403(b) plan as taxable income. Therefore, if you reside in one of these states, you may have to include your 403(b) contributions in your state or local taxable income. Consult with a tax advisor, if necessary.                                                                                                                                                                             What is the NYU Retirement Plan and what are the eligibility requirements?                                                         The NYU Retirement Plan is a defined contribution plan under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. You can join the NYU Retirement Plan if you are in an eligible job category at NYU, you normally work at least 20 hours per week, and you have completed one year of service. NYU provides a non-matching contribution of 5% of your retirement eligible salary in the NYU Retirement Plan effective after one year of service. In addition, for every 1% of salary you elect to contribute to the plan, NYU will match each 1% up to a maximum of 5% of your retirement eligible salary. Note: If you elect to contribute more than 5% of your retirement eligible salary ( subject to IRS limits ), those contributions will be deposited into the Supplemental Tax-Deferred Annuity Plan (STDA Plan).   You can join the NYU Retirement Plan if you are in an eligible job category at NYU with an eligible job title, you normally work at least 20 hours per week, and you have completed one year of service. You have a year of service if you\u2019ve completed:       One year at NYU in which you worked at least 1,000 hours; or   One year with your previous employer provided that:  \u2013 Your previous employer was a college, university, medical institution or practice, or tax-exempt medical research institution;  \u2013 Your employment with that institution ended not more than 180 days before your employment at NYU; and  \u2013 You were employed by that institution for at least one year in a non-student capacity and you worked at least 1,000 hours in that one-year period.   Note: If you have less than one year of service, you can begin contributions to the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity (STDA) Plan with your first paycheck or any time thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                How much can I contribute to a 403(b) Plan?                                                        The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) established maximum annual limits on the amount that you can contribute to your 403(b) accounts each year. If you participate in both the STDA Plan and the NYU Retirement Plan, your combined contributions to both plans, are subject to this IRS maximum .                                                                                                                                                                            What is the NYU Section 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan and what are the eligibility requirements?                                                        The NYU Section 457(b) Deferred Compensation Plan is a deferred compensation plan for eligible faculty, professional research staff, and administrative and professional staff that allows additional tax-deferred savings under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code.   Eligibility to participate in the 457(b) Plan is determined annually. In February each year, eligible employees will be notified through email of their eligibility to participate in the Plan, which runs from April 1 through December 31.   Note: Under Section 457(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, this Plan must be considered \"unfunded\" which means that your deferrals of salary (including any earnings on those deferrals) must be part of NYU's general assets. This means that in the unlikely event that NYU ever became insolvent, your deferrals under the Plan and any investment earnings that have accrued would be subject to the claims of NYU's general creditors and you might lose part or all of your benefits.                                                                                                                                                                            What is the Staff Pension Plan and what are the eligibility requirements?                                                       The NYU Staff Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan. The University funds the Plan and has oversight of the management of the assets.   You are eligible to participate in the NYU Staff Pension Plan if you are a staff employee working in an eligible job category - Office &amp; Clerical (Local 3882), Laboratory &amp; Technical (Local 3882), and Service Employees (Local 1, Local 810).   If you are an eligible staff employee, your participation in the Plan will begin on the September 1 closest to when you have completed at least 1,000 hours of service in the 12-month period from your date of hire and you have attained at least 21 years of age.   Note: If you were a Security Officer who was a participant in the Local One Security Officers Money Purchase Pension Plan on June 30, 2007, you became a participant in the NYU Staff Pension Plan on July 1, 2007.   NYU has outsourced the administration of the Plan to Milliman, Inc., which calculates the benefits and makes sure they are paid. You can reach them by calling the Milliman Benefits Service Center at 866-767-1212 or visit www.millimanbenefits.com .                                                                                         Age 70-1/2 Minimum Distributions                                                                                                                            What is a minimum required distribution and how does it affect me?                                                       Tax-deferred contributions to the NYU Retirement Plans (both your individual contributions and the NYU employer contributions) and earnings on those contributions cannot remain in the plan indefinitely. Federal minimum distribution requirements were established to ensure that you actually use your retirement plan account balances for your retirement.   The federal minimum required distribution applies to all employer-sponsored retirement plans and most IRAs.                                                                                                                                                                            When do I have to start taking money from my retirement account(s)?                                                       You are required to begin receiving distributions from your retirement account(s) no later than April 1 of the calendar year in which you turn age 70 1/2, or April 1 of the year after you retire, whichever is later.   In each subsequent year, the minimum required distribution must be made on or before December 31. These distributions must be spread evenly over a time period not extending beyond the life expectancy of you and your designated beneficiary.                                                                                                                                                                            What if I am still working at NYU past age 70 1/2?                                                       If you continue to work at NYU beyond age 70 1/2, you may defer taking distributions from your NYU retirement plan(s) until April 1 of the calendar year after you retire.   If you have other tax-deferred retirement accounts in addition to your NYU plan(s), you will be required to receive minimum distributions from those accounts once you reach 70 1/2, even if you are still working at NYU.                                                                                                                                                                            What happens if I do not take a distribution from my retirement account(s) after I reach age 70 1/2?                                                       The IRS rules are specific and strict. If you do not take at least the minimum required distribution amount from each of your retirement accounts by April 1 of the year after you turn 70 1/2 or retire, and continue to receive distributions each year thereafter, the Internal Revenue Code imposes a 50% penalty tax on the amount that should have been withdrawn in each calendar year. This tax is in addition to regular income taxes.   For more detail about the Minimum Distribution rules, visit the IRS website                                                                                                                                                                            Do I have to take a minimum distribution from my plan from a previous employer if I am still working at NYU?                                                       If you have a plan with a previous employer, you will have to take a minimum required distribution from that plan once you turn 70 1/2, but you may defer receiving payments from NYU's plan(s) as long as you are still working at NYU.                                                                                                                                                                            Do I have to take a minimum distribution from my individual rollover account (IRA) with Vanguard and/or TIAA-CREF if I am still working at NYU?                                                       If you rolled over monies from a previous employer-sponsored plan into an individual rollover account (IRA) with Vanguard and/or TIAA-CREF, these accounts are kept separate from your NYU plan account(s) and will be subject to the minimum distribution requirements, even if you are still working at NYU.   NYU does not allow monies from a previous employer to be rolled over into the NYU Plan.                                                                                                                                                                            Can I roll over my minimum required distribution into another qualified plan or individual account (IRA)?                                                       No, minimum distributions are taxable income and are not eligible for roll over into another pre-tax account.                                                                                                                                                                            Am I limited to withdrawing only the minimum required distribution from my retirement plan?                                                       No. You can take more than the minimum required distribution from your retirement plan in a given year. However, if you withdraw more than the minimum in any given year, you may not apply the amount in excess of the minimum required distribution toward the subsequent year.                                                                                                                                                                            Do I have a choice about how I receive a required distribution?                                                       Vanguard and TIAA-CREF allow you to elect a Minimum Distribution Option (MDO). The MDO allows you to choose monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual payments and choose any day from the 1st to the 28th of the month for payment.   Once you decide how you would like to receive your distribution, it can be directly deposited into your bank. In subsequent periods, you will receive the federal required minimum distribution payments automatically and you will not have to worry about completing paperwork and deadlines.                                                                                                                                                                            What if I need more income?                                                       Unlike annuity options (in which you use your accumulation to purchase a lifetime annuity income or income for a fixed period of years), if you are receiving a minimum required distribution under an MDO contract, you may be able to increase your future income, as long as there is a balance remaining in your account.                                                                                                                                                                            How is my minimum required distribution calculated?                                                       Your minimum required distribution is generally based on your life expectancy, beginning in the year you attain age 70. Payments are calculated by dividing the portion of your retirement savings that are subject to the rules by the applicable life expectancy, which is estimated using Internal Revenue Service (IRS) mortality tables.   If your spouse is your sole beneficiary and is more than 10 years younger than you, the IRS allows you to use the joint life expectancy of you and your spouse. This calculation, which uses a different IRS table, will result in lower required minimum distributions.                                                                                                                                                                            What is a grandfathered accumulation?                                                       Contributions and earnings credited to your account before 1987 are grandfathered and are not subject to the federal minimum distribution requirements until the year you reach age 75.   If you receive any payments before you are subject to the minimum distribution requirements, or make withdrawals in excess of minimum distribution amounts, these payments will reduce your grandfathered accumulation first. In the year you reach age 75, your grandfathered amount will automatically be included in your minimum distribution calculation.                                                                                                                                                                            Is my distribution subject to income taxes?                                                                 Payments will be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as income, distributions are usually fully taxable as ordinary income due to the fact that contributions were made on a tax-deferred basis.      Federal income tax will be withheld from your payments, if required, and state withholding may apply as well - requirements vary from state to state.                                                                                                          NYU Retirement Plan - 403(b)                                                                                                                            What are the advantages of the Plan?

What happens if I am also contributing to the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan?                                                       If you are contributing any amount up to 5% to the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan (STDA), the percentage you are contributing to the STDA, up to 5%, will automatically be moved to the NYU Retirement Plan account where you will receive a 1% match on each percentage of your contribution. This match is in addition to the 5% non-matching NYU contribution. For example, if you are contributing 8% of your salary to the STDA Plan, 5% will be changed to the NYU Retirement Plan and 3% will continue to be invested with the STDA plan. Your contributions to the NYU Retirement Plan will be invested in the Vanguard Target Retirement fund appropriate to your age unless you change your retirement plan elections.

When will my NYU Retirement Plan accounts be vested?                                                       You are fully vested immediately in all contributions you and the University make to your account.                                                                                                                                                                        Am I eligible to take a hardship distribution from the NYU Retirement Plan and/or the STDA Plan?                                                       Hardship distributions from the NYU Retirement Plan are not allowed. You may be eligible to take a hardship distribution of part or all of your NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan contributions only (excluding investment earnings). A withdrawal shall be available only in the event of an immediate and heavy financial need arising from:     The purchase of your principal residence (excluding mortgage payments);   Tuition and related educational fees for the next twelve (12) months of post high school education for you, your spouse, your child, or dependent claimed on your income tax return.   Avoidance of eviction or mortgage foreclosure in connection with your principal residence.   Uninsured medical expenses incurred or to be incurred by you, your spouse, or a dependent you claim on your tax return.   Payments for burial or funeral expenses for your deceased parent, spouse, children, or dependents.   Expenses for the repair of damage to your principal residence that would qualify for a casualty deduction such as fire, flood, storms including hurricanes, and tornadoes.     There are no situations other than those listed above which constitute a hardship under the NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan. In addition, hardship distributions are only available from TIAA-CREF. The STDA Plan requires that you exhaust your maximum loan available before being eligible for a hardship distribution. If your STDA Plan is invested with Vanguard, you must transfer your investments to TIAA-CREF before a loan and hardship distribution would be available to you.   TIAA-CREF will require such documentation as it deems necessary to support a Participant's assertion of a financial hardship. If a distribution is approved, your NYU Supplemental Tax Deferred Annuity Plan contribution will be stopped and you will not be permitted to resume contributions for six months from the date your hardship was approved. You must elect to begin your contribution after the six month suspension period ends. To do so, login to NYUHome and click on PeopleSync under the Work tab.
