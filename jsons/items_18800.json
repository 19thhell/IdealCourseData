Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.                  Study Questions   (1) Cystic fibrosis is caused by a recessive mutation. If a newborn baby's paternal grandfather and maternal grandfather were both carriers of the mutation, what is the probability that the baby will have cystic fibrosis?     (2) Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 act as dominant alleles in increasing risk of breast and ovarian cancer. If a baby girl's father had a mutant BRCA1 allele, what is the probability that she will have increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer?     ( 3) Approximately 10% of African Americans are carriers of the mutant allele that causes sickle-cell disease. From this number, calculate the expected incidence of sickle-cell disease in the African American population.   (4) Why does Gleevec represent a hopeful model for future approaches to cancer therapy? Why might it be difficult to apply this model to other cancers?

Genomics, the study of all the genes in an organism, is providing new insights into this amazing diversity of life on Earth. We begin with the fundamentals of DNA, genes and genomes. We then explore microbial diversity, with an emphasis on how genomics can reveal many aspects of organisms. We follow with examinations of animal and plant diversity. We examine the use of DNA to trace human ancestry, as well as the use of genomics as a diagnostic tool in medicine. We conclude by considering the societal implications of this ability to alter the genomes of crop plants, livestock and potentially humans.                  Study Questions   (1) Cystic fibrosis is caused by a recessive mutation. If a newborn baby's paternal grandfather and maternal grandfather were both carriers of the mutation, what is the probability that the baby will have cystic fibrosis?     (2) Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 act as dominant alleles in increasing risk of breast and ovarian cancer. If a baby girl's father had a mutant BRCA1 allele, what is the probability that she will have increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer?     ( 3) Approximately 10% of African Americans are carriers of the mutant allele that causes sickle-cell disease. From this number, calculate the expected incidence of sickle-cell disease in the African American population.   (4) Why does Gleevec represent a hopeful model for future approaches to cancer therapy? Why might it be difficult to apply this model to other cancers?

People and microbes both have DNA, the material that contains genetic instructions that how the micros act in our bodies, how they live with each other and how we react to them.\u00a0 All of the different kinds of microbes that live on and inside us, taken together, are called the \u201chuman microbiome.\u201d\u00a0 The purpose of the HMP (Human Microbiome Project) is to learn about the human microbiome by studying the microbes\u2019 DNA, other chemicals that the microbes produce, human DNA, and how microbes interact with each other and with their human host to contribute to health and disease. \u00a0                                 Resources       Interactive Forum   Esophageal Adenocarcinoma   Barrett\u2019s Esophagus   DACC   dbGaP   GERD Resource Center   GreenGenes   J Craig Venter Institute   Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory   MetaHIT   NCBI   QIIME   Ribosomal Database Project   SRA   Velos Database                                                   &copy; 2012 NYU Langone Medical Center | Address: 550 First Avenue, New York, NY 10016 | Phone: (212) 263-7300                         Ethics   Disclaimer   Privacy Policy   Contact Webmaster"}]}]
