Mental Canvas is a transformative software platform that bridges traditional drawing and 3D modeling, offering a novel way to develop, explore, and share visual ideas in 3D. Similar to what the word processor has done for text, or Photoshop has done for photography, Mental Canvas reimagines the sketch, imbuing it with entirely new capabilities, bringing it fully into the computer age.
