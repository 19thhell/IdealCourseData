FALL 2012 MAP-UA 722 Expressive Culture: Architecture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) syllabus New York's rich architectural heritage offers a unique opportunity for firsthand consideration of the concepts and styles of modern urban architecture, as well as its social, financial, and cultural contexts. Meets once a week for an extended period combining on-campus lectures with group excursions to prominent buildings. Attention is given both to individual buildings as examples of 19th- and 20th-century architecture and to phenomena such as the development of the skyscraper and the adaptation of older buildings to new uses.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Culture: Sounds Prof. Samuels (Music) Our lives pulsate with patterns of sounds that we call music. We encounter these sounds in our homes, cars, stores, and exercise salons; they accompany us to the grocery store, the dentist's office, and the movies; yet we rarely think consciously about what they mean. Through a series of specific case studies we investigate the function and significance of music and the musician in human life. We raise basic questions about how music has been created, produced, perceived, and evaluated at diverse historical moments, in a variety of geographical locations, and among different cultural groups. Through aural explorations and discussion of how these vivid worlds \"sound\" in time and space, we assess the value of music in human experience.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 730 Expressive Culture: Sounds  Prof. Ninoshvili (Music) syllabus Language and music are complementary modes of socio-cultural expression and communication with a nexus in the human voice. Ethnomusicologists have posited four key themes in the study of their intersection: music as language, music about language, language about music, and sung vocalization (music in language and language in music). We explore a broad spectrum of practices and ideas pertaining to the intersections of language, music, and the voice historically and across cultures. Specific cases include the relationship of vocal style, timbre, inflection, and lyric choice to place, identity, and musical genre; sung language in ritual and ecstatic religious experience; speech surrogates (for example, \"talking\" drums and whistle speech), jazz scat, \"vocables,\" and other phenomena which blur the speech-song divide; and the techniques, aesthetics, and ethics of the technologically mediated sung voice.     FALL 2012 MAP-UA 740 Expressive Culture: Performance Prof. Meineck (Classics/Aquila Theatre Company) syllabus Why do we still go to the theatre to watch plays? What is it about drama that can often seem to express so much about the tensions and stresses found in a given culture? Why does classical drama in particular continue to be performed and speak to so many different audiences? What is a classical play and how do theater artists interpret them for contemporary spectators, and why have so many works of drama been used to reflect the social, political, and economic situations of peoples all over the world? We explore the cultural significance of classical theater and how and why it continues to be performed today. We examine theater from four distinct period--ancient Athens, Elizabethan London, early modern Europe, and contemporary America--focusing on plays that are still regularly performed on contemporary stages. Students also take part in readings, exercises, and demonstrations, but they do not need to have any acting or performance ability.    FALL 2012 MAP-UA 750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Guerrero (Cinema Studies) syllabus A range of films made by, for, and about black Americans in popular commercial cinema covering a range of black-focused films and film making practices over the past one hundred years, from the crude racial provocations of Birth of a Nation (1915), to an 'entertaining blackness' expressed in such films as Cabin in the Sky (1943), Blaxploitation's brilliant industry intervention and moment, the challenge of independent black narratives like Killer of Sheep (1977) and Bless Their Little Hearts (1984), \u2018crossover\u2019 commercially ambitious films like Soul Food (1997) or Paid in Full (1997), and on to viewing break through masterworks like Do the Right Thing (1989).   SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 711 Expressive Culture: The Graphic Novel Prof. Borenstein (Russian and Slavic Studies)  syllabus Examines the interplay between words and images in the graphic novel, a hybrid medium with a system of communication reminiscent of prose fiction, animation, and film. What is the connection between text and art? How are internal psychology, time, and action conveyed in a static series of words and pictures? What can the graphic novel convey that other media cannot? Authors include Alan Moore, Art Spiegelman, Peter Milligan, Charles Burns, Carla Speed McNeil.     SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 720 Expressive Culture: Images Prof. Silver (Art History) Avant-Garde New York, from the Armory Show to Andy Warhol. New York became the center of avant-garde art-making in the period just after the Second World War, although the city had been preparing for its modernist ascendancy since the early years of the 20th century. We focus on art and its makers--native New Yorkers and out-of-towners, Americans and foreign-born practitioners--who helped shape and refine New York\u2019s extraordinarily rich avant-garde \u201ctradition.\u201d Painters, sculptors, photographers, architects, graphic artists, and set designers will be studied, including Alfred Stieglitz, Raymond Hood, Charles Demuth, Paul Manship, Piet Mondrian, Joseph Cornell, Helen Levitt, Isamu Noguchi, Jackson Pollock, Louise Nevelson, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Philip Johnson, and Andy Warhol, as will the context in which their work came into being and flourished--museums, galleries, art schools, patrons, artist neighborhoods, professional organizations, ad hoc associations, and artist \u201changouts.\u201d Topics include: the Stieglitz Circle and 291; The Armory Show (1913); the Paris/New York connection; the founding of the Museum of Modern Art; Marcel Duchamp and New York Dada; the art of the Harlem Renaissance; Frank O\u2019Hara--poet, critic, curator; Street Photography; the birth of Abstract Expressionism; Avant-gardism in Washington Square--Judson Dance Theater; From Madison Avenue to 57th Street--Pop Art Emerges. Includes class excursions to museums, galleries, and other New York art sites. SPRING 2013 MAP-UA 721 Expressive Culture: Painting and Sculpture in New York Field Study Prof. Broderick (Art History) New York's public art collections contain important examples of painting and sculpture from almost every phase of the past, as well as some of the world's foremost works of contemporary art.

Extending the focus on that vexed but also culturally rich and diverse year, we explore American society and its culture through cinema (with a side look at some other cultural forms--1967 is, for instance, also the year of that key rock album, The Beatles\u2019 Sgt.

It was during these decades that Impressionism launched its assault on the academic establishment, only itself to be superseded by an ever-changing avant-garde associated first with the nabis, then with fauvism and cubism; that the operas of Bizet, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet and the plays of Sardou and Rostand filled the world\u2019s theaters; and that the novels of Zola and stories of Maupassant were translated into dozens of languages. Finally, this was the society that gave birth to one of the greatest literary works of all time, Marcel Proust\u2019s Remembrances of Things Past, the first volume of which appeared just as the First World War was about to bring the Belle \u00c9poque to a violent end.

Performances complicate and enliven our experience of communication, and incredible performances will remain in our minds long after their original event. At the front and center of any performance is the performer; but other factors contribute to the staging of a performance . In this course we will explore the multiple dimensions of musical performance. We will begin by reading theories of performance while developing a practical methodology for descriptive musical analysis based on close listening. We will compare recordings of similar music by different performances and listen to interviews to gain insight into how performers approach music. Next, we will examine the relationship between the performer, composer and the score in classical music. Finally, we will break away from individual artistic agents to consider the influence of material and social factors such as instruments, acoustics, electronic technology and concert cultures upon musical performances. No background in music theory and notation is assumed or required.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. The Art of Listening: Vienna 1900 - MUSIC-UA 3 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Anna Stoll-Knecht    This course will explore modes of listening within a particular context: Vienna at the turn of the twentieth century. During one semester, we will immerse ourselves in this specific place, at a fascinating moment in history, that witnessed extremely productive exchanges between the arts, as well as between the arts and sciences. Beginning with general questions about listening (How do we listen today? Do we need \"training\" to listen?), we will then turn to practices of listening to music, and discuss how \"listening\" relates to \"analyzing,\" and to \"understanding.\" At this point we will travel to Vienna (with our minds) and set up the context of our exploration. Circulating between visual arts, music, architecture, literature, theater, we will use this material to think further about different modes of listening: how is listening to a Mahler symphony in a concert hall different from listening to a show in a Viennese cabaret, or to a marching band in the streets? What does it change to listen to music with words (opera, operetta, songs) and to music without words (symphony), or to watch a silent movie, without words but with music? Music was everywhere in Vienna at this time (streets, caf \u00e9s, cabarets, parks), and it was part of the everyday life of everyone. Its development was nurtured by collaborations with painters (Sch \u00f6 nberg and Kandinsky, for example) or writers (Strauss and Hofmannstahl, Srauss and Zweig). The richness of this unique context will allow us to address fundamental questions concerning different ways of listening - including an incursion into the psychoanalytical practice of listening. Listening to music with a moving image (with or without words) will constitute one of the main threads of this class, starting with German movies of the 1930's (Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg) up to Orson Welles, Max Oph \u00fcls, Alfred Hitchcock, Luchino Visconti and Stanley Kubrick - each movie being related to Vienna 1900 in some way.    There will be at least two guest lectures, for the sake of diversity; and for lack of being able to travel to Vienna for real, we will spend a class at the Neue Galerie on 86th Street, where one can drink a Viennese coffee, eat a Sacher torte, view some paintings, read the newspaper, and enjoy a true Viennese experience.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors and Minors. Elements of Music - MUSIC-UA 20 Monday &amp; Wednesday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 320) Please refer to Albert for lab sections Instructor: TBA Explores the underlying principles and inner workings of the tonal system, a system that has guided all of Western music from the years 1600 to 1900. It includes a discussion of historical background and evolution. The focus is on concepts and notation of key, scale, tonality, and rhythm. Related skills in sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony are stressed in the recitation sections.    This course does not fulfill any requirement for Music Majors, but can be taken as part of the requirements for a Music Minor.    Topics in 20th Century Music: The Long 19th Century - Sixty Glorious Years, 1876-1936 - MUSIC-UA 111 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller The historical narrative of the \"long century,\" as defined by Eric Hobsbawm, a British Marxist historian and author, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. This idea of the \"long century\" when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, this period is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition - and frequently unruly first performances - of Schoenberg's Second String Quartet, Verkl \u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky's Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Alban Berg, Anton von Webern, and B \u00e9la Bart \u00f3k. Richard Strauss's operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with Franz L  \u00e9har's The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus's The Chocolate Soldier , while practically the whole major output of Charles Ives was produced in isolation. Busoni published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music in 1907, and Luigi Russolo issued his \"Futurist Manifesto\" in 1913, shortly before the European continental conflagration began. It was the period of The Mikado, Madama Butterfly, Das Lied von der Erde, Pomp and Circumstance , as well as the Maple-Leaf Rag and Tin-Pan Alley.    This class will explore the ISMS most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes, music evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety - change and progress that turns on itself - will form the core of the class. We will examine traditional musical materials and modes of expression and the radical central problem of dissolving tonality associated with Schoenberg's \"emancipation of dissonance.\" In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \"fin-de-si \u00e8 cle\") and Paris (the positive \"la belle \u00c9 poque\"), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der blaue Reiter, Die Br \u00fc cke , the Fauves, L'art nouveau , and Cubisme .    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\" The Wagner Operas: Sex, Drugs, Felonies, and Fallacies - MUSIC-UA 136 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 9:30-10:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Rena Mueller Richard Wagner's music, words, themes, images, gestures, and intent, were the stuff of nation-building that wrought havoc with the status-quo, havoc with which we are still dealing to this day. While his musical influence is unmistakeable, the ramifications of his political and social activities spread across the face of Europe from 1848 through to, arguably, 1914--and even to the present day, with the Wagner descendants front and center. This course will examine the tumultuous musical, political, and social milieus surrounding Wagner's oeuvre--musician, poet, impresario, political activist, and lightening rod for the unification of Germany. Wagner was wrapped up in the the importance of German history, especially at this pivotal time in the 19th century. He paid dearly with exile and isolation for his political activities during the 1849 Dresden uprising, and his uncompromising belief in the supremacy of everything German supported Bismarck as the newly-unified nation sought to establish itself as the equal, if not the better, of long-standing imperial regimes (Austria-Hungary, France, Great Britain, Spain). He was afforded by King Ludwig of Bavaria untold influence over major decisions in Munich concerning the appointment and function of ministers and other officials, until his actions stepped over the line. Inspired by his own innovative ideas of a total musical experience ( Gesamtkunstwerk : his term, not one he ultimately disavowed), the course will look at all the components he thought important: the small details (the way Leitmotives work), the construction of the larger whole (librettos, staging, rigging, and theater design), and the notion of operatic performance at the time and its presentation to the public in terms of voice production and instrumentation.    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\" Anthropology of Music: Music and Language - MUSIC-UA 153 (section 001) Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:30-1:45 (Room TBA) Instructor: Lauren Ninoshvili Music and language are intertwined, universal aspects of human communication, expression, and social life. This course draws on methods of sociocultural, musical, and linguistic analysis to explore practices at the intersection of music, language, and the human voice - both popular and elite, contemporary and historic, Western and non-Western.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 7: \"Analytical and Critical Thinking\"    Anthropology of Music: Native American Music and Poetics - MUSIC-UA 153 (section 002) Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00-12:15 (Room TBA) Instructor: David Samuels One could argue, in a sense, that American Anthropology and Ethnomusicology were built on a scaffolding of fascination with the expressive culture of Native Americans. In any case, understandings and misunderstandings of Native American musical and poetic practices have keyed the development of scholarly approaches to world music for more than a century. In this course we will explore the ways that ethnographic encounters with Native American music and poetry have informed notions of human culture, society, and creativity. Exploration of contemporary work will help us judge the state of the art today.    Fulfills a requirement for Courses 5 and 6: \"Music, Histories, Cultures\"    Proseminar in Musical Research - MUSIC-UA 200 Monday &amp; Wednesday 3:30-4:45 (Silver 218) Instructor: Stanley Boorman This course is required of all Honors students in the department. It is a seminar discussing recent ideas and issues in all areas of musical research, musicology, ethnomusicology, and theory. Faculty members in the department will introduce different topics, discussing the ideas and their application, so that by the end of the semester students will be capable of undertaking the advanced research project required for an Honors degree.

Principles of Musical Analysis: Aural Perception - MUSIC-UA 209 Monday &amp; Wednesday 2:00-3:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: J. Martin Daughtry \"Aural Perception\" is a comprehensive introduction to the dynamics of sound and listening in multiple contexts and registers. Through listening exercises, class discussion, and creative work, students learn how to: (1) discern and analyze musical structures, styles, and other features; (2) explore the relationship between sound (including work of different repertoires) and notation; and (3) think critically about the roles sound and listening play in their lives. This course is a requirement for all music majors. There are no prerequisites, but students must secure permission from the music department before enrolling.    Fulfills the requirement for Course 2: \"Aural Perception\"    Principles of Composition - MUSIC-UA 307 Tuesday 3:30-6:00 (Room TBA) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman This class in composition includes the study of selected contemporary compositions, toward 1) developing a shared language for talking about compositional practice and sonic art; and 2) toward appreciating the range of musical expression that has been enabled by certain avant-garde practices, including new degrees of freedom, and new attitudes about music as conceptual art. We will look in particular at three genres of compositions - those for human body sounds; those for performance on homemade instruments; and those written for a cappella voice.    In the second part of the course we will explore composition for fixed media, i.e., electroacoustic media, or fixed media coordinated with one of the three categories above. Fixed media examples we will study in class include pieces whose source material is spoken text. Finally, we will explore the use of selected and relatively simple live processing techniques (such as reverb and delay) as means by which to expand acoustic resources. The focus here will be on compositional ideation, and on sound as a signifier; psychoacoustics and the perceptual qualities of sound; and musical memory. Very limited attention will be devoted in this course to developing technical expertise in computer music. Throughout the course we will consider how some of the limitations of these non-traditional instruments and of fixed media are simultaneously points of expanded expressive potential.    The course will (most often) culminate in a Music Department concert in which all student works will be presented. This course serves as a prerequisite for the department's Advanced Composition course in cases where a student has not taken Harmony and Counterpoint II.    Fulfills a requirement for Course 4: \"Creating Music.\" This course (or Harmony and Counterpoint II) is a prerequisite for advanced courses in composition.    Special Topics Seminar: Synths, Samplers, Drum Machines, Effects Processors, and Beyond - Programming in Pd - MUSIC-UA 901 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00-12:15 (Silver 320) Instructor: Jaime Oliver Technological devices have shaped the evolution of popular music. Imagine Hendrix playing on an acoustic guitar, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds played on a piano, electronic dance music played by a rock band, hip hop without turntables and samplers. These technologies and the music made with them are inseparable. In this course, we will learn to program computers to make music using the open source programming environment Pure Data (Pd), by emulating some of the technologies that defined popular music in the second half of the 20th century. As we move through the course content, we will learn concepts in digital audio and acoustics, and explore the work of artists, their music, machines, and the ideas that fostered and resulted from them.
