Check back in May 2015 for updates on a 2016 offering.   2013 dates were: Tuesday, January 1 (arrival day) - Sunday, January 13 (departure day), 2013. First day of class is Thursday, January 3, last day of class is Saturday, January 12. Note: The course begins on the evening of Wednesday, January 2 with a welcome at the hotel.   The Course   PADM-GP 2201 | Syllabus   International development is a hotly contested and highly politicized field. This course carves out a narrow slice of this large pie and introduces students to the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing countries. It gives special emphasis to the case of Brazil. Throughout the 20th century, and similar to many other developing nations, Brazil has experienced deep economic transformations. Moreover, in recent decades it has enacted a range of institutional reforms to promote social inclusion, environmental protection, and business growth. Despite marked success in a number of areas, the country still struggles to promote good governance, empower its citizenry, create jobs, and raise millions out of poverty.   What can we learn from these experiences? It would be nice if we could isolate blueprints, pre-packaged tools, formulas and other ready-to-use frameworks. Unfortunately, these resources rarely work as intended. Rather, this course encourages students to analyze the theories that underpin existing initiatives, identify principles of action, and use their policy imagination to adapt findings to other contexts. A combination of lectures, class discussions, exercises, and field visits will help in this task.   This course is a joint activity of NYU Wagner and the School of Management and the Collective Health Institute (ISC) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). Brazilian and US-based students and faculty will participate in all activities and all instruction will be conducted in English.   Portuguese language skills will be useful but are not required.   Visit UFBA's website for photos of the campus and facilities.

Check back in May 2015 for updates on a 2016 offering.   2013 dates were: Tuesday, January 1 (arrival day) - Sunday, January 13 (departure day), 2013. First day of class is Thursday, January 3, last day of class is Saturday, January 12. Note: The course begins on the evening of Wednesday, January 2 with a welcome at the hotel.   The Course   PADM-GP 2201 | Syllabus   International development is a hotly contested and highly politicized field. This course carves out a narrow slice of this large pie and introduces students to the theory and practice of institutional reform in developing countries. It gives special emphasis to the case of Brazil. Throughout the 20th century, and similar to many other developing nations, Brazil has experienced deep economic transformations. Moreover, in recent decades it has enacted a range of institutional reforms to promote social inclusion, environmental protection, and business growth. Despite marked success in a number of areas, the country still struggles to promote good governance, empower its citizenry, create jobs, and raise millions out of poverty.   What can we learn from these experiences? It would be nice if we could isolate blueprints, pre-packaged tools, formulas and other ready-to-use frameworks. Unfortunately, these resources rarely work as intended. Rather, this course encourages students to analyze the theories that underpin existing initiatives, identify principles of action, and use their policy imagination to adapt findings to other contexts. A combination of lectures, class discussions, exercises, and field visits will help in this task.   This course is a joint activity of NYU Wagner and the School of Management and the Collective Health Institute (ISC) at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA). Brazilian and US-based students and faculty will participate in all activities and all instruction will be conducted in English.   Portuguese language skills will be useful but are not required.   Visit UFBA's website for photos of the campus and facilities.

GIPH is invested in producing research of the highest caliber and houses a global public health research center, serving as a University-wide resource for large scale, multi-school, multi-disciplinary and multi-site research projects. GIPH research draws from faculty expertise on multiple topics in multiple geographic settings; coordinates administrative support; works collaboratively with community partners and constituents; and takes a comprehensive approach to research problems, incorporating complimentary perspectives and approaches from across disciplines.            Research Profile: NYU/Ghana Health Partnership                                   New York University and its affiliated public hospital, Bellevue Hospital Center , and the University of Ghana and its affiliated public hospital, the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital , have developed a multi-disciplinary collaboration for health professional development that will result in sustained and significant improvements in health and health care in Ghana and the United States. More recently, this NYU/Ghana Health partnership has expanded to include the new University of Health &amp; Allied Sciences (Volta) as well as the Ministry of Health and the Ghana Health Service.           A variety of projects are underway, involving faculty from several of NYU's schools (Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, Steinhardt, Wagner). The partnership addresses a variety of topics, including but not limited to:     increasing the midlevel provider workforce in sub-saharan Africa   improving access to qualified health providers   improving health outcomes (including nutrition, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, oral health)     creating cost effectivenss to lower the financial burden on national financing systems   stengthening emergency medicine systems and services in Ghana            Research Highlights          Faculty who participate in the Global Institute of Public Health engage in a diverse and impressive array of research across the university.

The goal is to understand how history and politics, inputs and technology, financing mechanisms, organizational processes and structures, and individual behaviors act separately and together to affect the development of national health systems and their characteristics. The course will also introduce students to several essential data sources and provide hands-on training on ways to use real data to develop health services research projects.
