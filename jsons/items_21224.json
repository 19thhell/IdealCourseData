The major goals of this specialization are to enable students to:   Evaluate and use knowledge and understanding of values and institutional contexts for environmental and infrastructure planning.   Explore theories and historical trends to evaluate relationships between environmental condition, public service capacity, and development options, and their consequences of human actions on the environment.   Understand choices about and ways of balancing the use and protection of environmental resources in urban and natural environmental contexts and in the context of other social needs.   Engage public interests in the process of environmental, infrastructure and transportation planning.

Semester: Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           This course introduces students in urban planning and related fields, to the ways in which urban planning and urban design can help to improve community health. Although urban planning and public health are closely related in their history and their objectives, these fields have been historically taught and practiced independently with limited interaction. The course focuses on neighborhood scale planning issues that impact health, including transportation, land use, urban design, community development, and crime prevention. This class will involve discussions, lectures, guest speakers, readings, and a research report.
