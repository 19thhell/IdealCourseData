New York University (Tisch, Film and Television) Biography A visual artist since  childhood, I have always been filled with a burning desire to tell stories with  my art. Primarily self taught and armed with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in  Film from NYU, I entered the professional world of filmmaking in 1989 as a  special effects make-up artist. In this field, it takes a special mind that is  part artist, part technician and part magician to transform actors into  monsters, create creatures that do not exist in the real world, and portray  violence in a realistic manner. My extensive experience in this art form, which  requires many steps, has prepared me for the current method with which I create  my photography. My creative process is innovative. I create all of the elements  of my art separately and then bring them all together at the end to create a  seamless, coherent and powerful image. My methodology consists of digital  capture, digital imaging and digital compositing. I begin with creating concept  art illustrations and paintings and then moving into casting, prop and costume  design and fabrication, hair and make up design, directing, digital  photography, green screen and finally post-production. I draw inspiration from  the writings of Joseph Campbell, the lighting of the Pre-Raphaelites painters,  the landscapes of the Hudson River School painters, the compositions of Gustave  Dore, the power of Frank Frazetta and the innovations of contemporary Japanese concept  artists. Ultimately, each time I grow as an artist, I grow as an individual and  a teacher. I strive to inspire by showing that creativity has no limit and that  technology is simply another tool to create art. I measure my success by the  invisibility of my technical virtuosity and the power of my images to elevate  the audience's heart and spark their imagination.
