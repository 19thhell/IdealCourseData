In collaboration with experts in the areas they are studying, students conduct inquiry-based projects where they learn the techniques necessary to complete professional projects. We call these courses &quot;Production Studios,&quot; which means that from the first studio that covers fundamentals of sound and moving image design to advanced studios in the senior year, students are gaining experience in solving real-world problems with the support of active professionals in the field. Each student also completes a senior project, and students are encouraged to take an internship as part of the Department&#39;s internship course.   Science and Technology Studies   Our major in Science and Technology Studies also encourages students to learn by doing. Each student chooses a concentration in a scientific or technical field, and dedicates part of his or her studies to laboratory work in the sciences or engineering. In addition, many STS electives are run in a seminar format where students conduct research and write papers about their findings. Students have the opportunity to take an internship course that guides them through an experiential learning opportunity, and some students choose to do independent studies courses with their professors. Each senior also completes a capstone project under the guidance of a faculty member.      Students in STS 2323 learn first-hand how fossils are found and used to create theories about the past.   Sustainable Urban Environments   Students in the Sustainbale Urban Environments are actively engaged in projects throughout their college careers. Many professors encourage students to engage in social science research as part of their coursework, whether that be documenting the effects of changes in transportation or doing site visits to evaluate New York&#39;s urban environment. Students are required to take a course along with an internship that guides them through an experiential learning opportunity. Each senior also completes a capstone project, in which students work as a group to address a real world issue in urban sustainability.

Our faculty use humanities and social science perspectives and methods to examine critical questions about the role of technology and science in ethics, art, city building, and other domains.   We offer interdisciplinary BS degree programs in Integrated Digital Media (IDM) , Science and Technology Studies (STS) , and Sustainable Urban Environments (SUE) . In addition, we offer a Master of Science degree in Integrated Digital Media . These programs give students the knowledge to understand and engage with the technological and scientific society and culture in which they live and the skills that will lead to successful and rewarding careers. This program combines high-end production classes in media with research-grade investigation of new tools, techniques, and practices.     The Department of Technology, Culture and Society offers elective courses in the humanities and social sciences to meet the General Education requirement for undergraduate students. The cluster curriculum helps today&rsquo;s engineers and scientists make thoughtful decisions about the values that are implicit in technological options, to understand how human see themselves and the natural and social worlds, to think critically, and to communicate effectively.
