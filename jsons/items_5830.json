This track is open only to students with a minimum of a baccalaureate or equivalent degree, alone or combined with advanced clinical training. Candidates are chosen based on their academic records and recommendations and an assessment of the candidate's scholarly potential. MCAT or DAT scores may be submitted in lieu of the GRE (when applying, leave the GRE section blank and upload the MCAT/DAT scores at the end as supplemental information). Applicants whose native language is not English and have not obtained a degree from a US institution must submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.    Students are awarded the Master of Science degree in Biology degree upon completion of 36 credits with an average GPA of 3.0 or higher, and completion of a qualifying research paper. 24 of the credits must be completed in Biology courses or courses cross-listed with Biology (BIOL-GA). The remaining 12 credits can be completed in graduate courses offered through other departments such as the Department of Biomaterials or Basic Sciences. The qualifying paper (also called a Master\u2019s thesis) can be written based on original laboratory research results (laboratory-based thesis) or an in-depth literature study of an area of oral biology (library-based thesis). The thesis is typically mentored by a faculty member at NYUCD.   Scholarship and Financial Support   At present, there are no scholarships available and all applicants are fully responsible for all costs associated with this program. However there are teaching adjunct positions available . For more information contact Gail Kashishian in the Department of Biology: (212) 998-8212; gk6@nyu.edu .

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .   Core Curriculum   In addition to the specialty-specific curriculum, postgraduate programs at NYU College of Dentistry draw upon the talents of world-class clinicians and scientists to deliver a menu of core course topics with relevance to multiple specialties. Themes in core courses range from biological sciences to practice management. Enrollment in the various topic areas varies by program.

This track is open only to students with a minimum of a baccalaureate or equivalent degree, alone or combined with advanced clinical training. Candidates are chosen based on their academic records and recommendations and an assessment of the candidate's scholarly potential. MCAT or DAT scores may be submitted in lieu of the GRE (when applying, leave the GRE section blank and upload the MCAT/DAT scores at the end as supplemental information). Applicants whose native language is not English and have not obtained a degree from a US institution must submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.    Students are awarded the Master of Science degree in Biology degree upon completion of 36 credits with an average GPA of 3.0 or higher, and completion of a qualifying research paper. 24 of the credits must be completed in Biology courses or courses cross-listed with Biology (BIOL-GA). The remaining 12 credits can be completed in graduate courses offered through other departments such as the Department of Biomaterials or Basic Sciences. The qualifying paper (also called a Master\u2019s thesis) can be written based on original laboratory research results (laboratory-based thesis) or an in-depth literature study of an area of oral biology (library-based thesis). The thesis is typically mentored by a faculty member at NYUCD.   Scholarship and Financial Support   At present, there are no scholarships available and all applicants are fully responsible for all costs associated with this program. However there are teaching adjunct positions available . For more information contact Gail Kashishian in the Department of Biology: (212) 998-8212; gk6@nyu.edu .

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .

This track is open only to students with a minimum of a baccalaureate or equivalent degree, alone or combined with advanced clinical training. Candidates are chosen based on their academic records and recommendations and an assessment of the candidate's scholarly potential. MCAT or DAT scores may be submitted in lieu of the GRE (when applying, leave the GRE section blank and upload the MCAT/DAT scores at the end as supplemental information). Applicants whose native language is not English and have not obtained a degree from a US institution must submit the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores.    Students are awarded the Master of Science degree in Biology degree upon completion of 36 credits with an average GPA of 3.0 or higher, and completion of a qualifying research paper. 24 of the credits must be completed in Biology courses or courses cross-listed with Biology (BIOL-GA). The remaining 12 credits can be completed in graduate courses offered through other departments such as the Department of Biomaterials or Basic Sciences. The qualifying paper (also called a Master\u2019s thesis) can be written based on original laboratory research results (laboratory-based thesis) or an in-depth literature study of an area of oral biology (library-based thesis). The thesis is typically mentored by a faculty member at NYUCD.   Scholarship and Financial Support   At present, there are no scholarships available and all applicants are fully responsible for all costs associated with this program. However there are teaching adjunct positions available . For more information contact Gail Kashishian in the Department of Biology: (212) 998-8212; gk6@nyu.edu .

Weds, May 13, 2015   Register now &gt;&gt;&gt;        our mission   The mission of the Advanced Education Programs at New York University College of Dentistry is to provide a specialty-level learning experience that emphasizes health promotion and disease prevention, producing highly proficient specialists with the knowledge, skills and experience to diagnose and treat diseases, abnormalities and other conditions that affect the oral and perioral tissues.         Post-graduate education builds upon the knowledge base of a competent general dentist and broadens understanding of the biomedical sciences, behavioral sciences, and clinical sciences, as well as the social issues related to the general health and well-being of the public. The educational process reinforces both the ethical responsibility of the health care professional for the public and the keen sense of the role of the dentist as an integral and integrated member of the health professions team. Throughout their education, students will be stimulated to model values and beliefs which demonstrate the commitment of the profession to the public welfare. As part of a responsibility to the profession, intrinsic to the programs will be the encouragement of students to pursue careers in academic dentistry.   NYU College of Dentistry offers Advanced Education Programs that lead to proficiency in major areas of clinical study and satisfy the educational requirements for specialization and/or specialty board certification in six CODA-accredited specialties: Endodontics , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 6-year Integrated MD Program , Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: 4-year Certificate Program , Orthodontics &amp; Dentofacial Orthopedics , Pediatric Dentistry , Periodontics and Prosthodontics .   Core Curriculum   In addition to the specialty-specific curriculum, postgraduate programs at NYU College of Dentistry draw upon the talents of world-class clinicians and scientists to deliver a menu of core course topics with relevance to multiple specialties. Themes in core courses range from biological sciences to practice management. Enrollment in the various topic areas varies by program. The interdisciplinary platform strengthens relationships among residents within and between specialty programs.

Program are accepted for Fall or Spring admission. Applicants for admission to the M.S. program must have successfully completed an undergraduate major in a science or followed a pre-health curriculum (B average or better generally required) and must submit three letters of recommendation. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required for admission to the M.S. program. Application information: http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication. Fall 2015 Application Deadline: May 15, 2015.  Degree Requirements Students are awarded a Master of Science degree on (1) completion of 36 points with an average of B or better and (2) satisfactory completion of a qualifying research paper (commonly called a thesis). Of the 36 points required, 24 must be from the Department of Biology at New York University. All entering M.S. students typically take Bio Core 1 (BIOL-GA 1001) and Bio Core 2 (BIOL-GA 1002). See individual tracks below for additional curriculum information.  Courses of Study  M.S. in Biology , a program providing a broad base in the principles of modern biology, which frequently includes advanced coursework in cell biology, molecular biology, microbiology, physiology, neurobiology, immunology, genetics genomics and systems. This program is designed for either part or full-time students. Students in the Master's of Biology program have several options for their course of study and choose from the following tracks:       General Biology provides students with general knowledge of biology. Students interested in applying to medical school typically choose this track. Track adviser: Dr. Christine Rushlow (car2@nyu.edu).   Bioinformatics and Systems Biology , (formerly called Computers in Biology) provides students with a firm understanding of the application of computational technology to both theoretical and practical aspects of the study of biology. Track adviser: Dr. Manpreet Katari (mkatari@nyu.edu).    Applied Recombinant DNA Technology , a specialization designed to give students a thorough training in molecular biology, including both design of approaches that use recombinant DNA technology, as well as hands-on training in laboratory techniques. Track adviser: Dr. Nikolai Kirov (nk2@nyu.edu).    Oral Biology is offered through the Department of Biology in collaboration with the NYU College of Dentistry. The goal of the specialization includes advancing the knowledge base in oral biology in order to provide 1) pre-dental applicants with an opportunity to strengthen their bio-science education, thereby increasing their competitiveness for admission to dental school, and 2) US and international dentists with graduate-level training and experience in research methodology and technology to better qualify them for careers in academic dentistry and/or healthcare-related industry activities; and enabling practicing dentists to improve the quality of care they offer by increasing their understanding of basic biological principles in a field applicable to dentistry. Track adviser: Dr. Yihong Li (yihong.li@nyu.edu).      Dual Degree M.S. in Biology and MBA from Stern, offered in conjunction with NYU's Stern School of Business. This program meets a need for academic preparation and training in Scientist-Managers for the biotechnology and pharmacology industries, academic Industrial Liaison personnel, Investment Specialists for the financial sector, and Government Regulatory personnel. Program advisers: Christine Rushlow for Biology (car2@nyu.edu) and Sarah E. Lazzari for Stern (slazzari@stern.nyu.edu).  GRE for Applicants to Biology/Business: GRE general test or GMAT scores required. Send official GMAT test scores to GSAS using school code 5TF-5G-76 (also separately send GMAT scores to Stern where the GMAT is required, using their GMAT school code)                                                            Master of Philosophy (MPh) , is conferred only to students accepted as candidates in the doctoral program who have fulfilled all doctorate requirements except the dissertation and its defense. This includes 72 credits and the passing of both the qualifying examination and thesis proposal examination.             Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
