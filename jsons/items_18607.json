The book describes the unusual physics of the material: that it offers linear rather than parabolic energy bands. The Dirac-like electron energy bands lead to high constant carrier speed, similar to light photons. The lattice symmetry further implies a two-component wave-function, which has a practical effect of cancelling direct backscattering of carriers. The resulting high carrier mobility allows observation of the Quantum Hall Effect at room temperature, unique to Graphene. The material is two-dimensional, but in sizes micrometers nearly to meters displays great tensile strength but vanishing resistance to bending.      The book reviews theoretical predictions of excessive atomic vibrational motion, tied to the dimensionality. The book reviews potential applications within existing electronics, to include interconnect wires, flash-memory elements, and high frequency field effect transistors. The chance to supplant the dominant CMOS family of silicon logic devices is assessed.

The material is two-dimensional, but in sizes micrometers nearly to meters displays great tensile strength but vanishing resistance to bending.      The book reviews theoretical predictions of excessive atomic vibrational motion, tied to the dimensionality. The book reviews potential applications within existing electronics, to include interconnect wires, flash-memory elements, and high frequency field effect transistors. The chance to supplant the dominant CMOS family of silicon logic devices is assessed.      Wolf is a professor in NYU-Poly&rsquo;s Department of Applied Physics.

Wolf, professor of physics at the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, presents and analyzes as a replacement for silicon.   Graphene, as described by Wolf, is a &ldquo;single layer of the graphite crystal, pure covalently bonded carbon in a honeycomb lattice, one atom thick&rdquo; and a &ldquo;leading example of a two-dimensional crystalline material.&rdquo; The book&rsquo;s primary focus is on solar cell and CMOS (complementary metal&ndash;oxide&ndash;semiconductor) device technologies, with attention to the fabrication methods. Specialized applications for graphene within the existing silicon technology are discussed and found to be promising.   A Fellow of the American Physical Society, Wolf has been the recipient of a Sigma Xi Distinguished Faculty Research Award and a Joseph J. Jacobs Excellence in Education Award, among other honors. In addition to Applications of Graphene, his books include Understanding the Nanotechnology Revolution, Nanophysics of Solar and Renewable Energy, Quantum Nanoelectronics: An Introduction to Electronic Nanotechnology and Quantum Computing, and Nanophysics and Nanotechnology: An Introduction to Modern Concepts in Nanoscience .
