Our graduates have the reputation of being creative muses and innovative choreographers; they perform with world-class dance companies and choreographers, appear on Broadway, at Radio City Music Hall, at The Metropolitan Opera, striking a balance between concert and commercial dance. The Master\u2019s degree program is an opportunity for individuals to further their education in dance through physical and academic immersion. Unlike many graduate dance programs, Tisch Dance does not require that applicants have a degree in dance or a dance related field, creating a unique environment where students approach dance in a fresh and innovative manner, using their individual knowledge and experience to expand and explore existing notions of dance and choreography. The graduate program at Tisch Dance seeks to empower individuals with the ideals that dance is not simply a physical endeavor, but a life-long investigation of individual growth and creativity.    Technique, Academic Dance Course Work, and Creative Research The Dance Department at Tisch has a strong technical base, requiring all Master\u2019s students to participate in daily ballet and contemporary technique classes; these classes are divided into multiple levels in which graduate students combine with undergraduates (class combining occurs only in technique classes). Additional technique courses include: contemporary and classical partnering, pointe work, men\u2019s class, Yoga, Pilates and other somatic practices. The physical rigor of the program insures that students maintain the highest level of technical practice while simultaneously providing them opportunities to apply newly acquired knowledge from other dance and academic courses.    In addition to technique classes, graduate students also study music history and theory, dance history, anatomy, acting, critical thinking and analysis of dance, and collaborative practices. These courses provide graduate students the opportunity to research and analyze dance in a critical manner, challenging them to explore new areas of dance study. In their second year of study students have the option of taking elective courses in dance and new media, music composition, pedagogy, musical collaboration, and lighting design. These courses provide students a comprehensive understanding of the multi-faceted nature of dance and allow them to tailor the program to their individual interests.    Graduate students are also provided the opportunity to take special workshops in dance administration led by Allyson Green, Associate Dean of the Institute of Performing Arts at NYU, and Dana Witco, Assistant Director of the Institute of Performing Arts at NYU. These classes introduce graduate students to the administrative end of the art world, with topics that include: marketing skills, grant making, artist statements, and how to acquire resources for dance-making.    A key component of the Master\u2019s program at Tisch is dance composition, required for all students, which is taken throughout the two year program. This course, taught by leading professionals in the New York dance community, combines elements of composition and improvisation and strives to break down preconceived notions of choreography to discover the individual\u2019s unique choreographic voice.    Second Avenue Dance Company The final year of study culminates in a modeled professional experience in our resident performing ensemble, the Second Avenue Dance Company (SADC). SADC functions as Tisch Dance\u2019s professional dance company, operating independently from students in their first years of study. Each year, four noteworthy guest choreographers are engaged to create new work or set existing master works, providing students a professional experience and allowing them to explore new styles of dance. In addition to performing work by guest choreographers, students also develop their own choreography, all of which is showcased in four concerts throughout their SADC year.    Performance The Dance Department produces twelve concerts each year, a total of 38 nights of performances and upwards of 75 student pieces each year, affording students numerous opportunities to perform and choreograph. Each concert is supervised by one of our experienced faculty, with whom students work closely to craft their work and bring their artistic vision to life. Graduate students produce two concerts each year, in which only work choreographed by either the first or second year Master\u2019s students is presented, exhibiting to the school and the New York dance community the caliber of originality and innovation of our graduate students. All performances are produced in a theater with full lights and costumes, allowing students to build a repertoire and gain experience as performers.   Training Program M.F.A.
