The competition is made possible through a gift from The Bickel &amp; Brewer Foundation.   The debate topic for the 2012-13 competition was: &quot;Resolved: Increased taxes on the wealthy will not improve the global economy.\u201d In the final round, Isabelle Klinghoffer/Nathaniel White representing NYU New York defeated Katherine Wong/Nikhil Jayawickrama representing NYU London in front of a packed house in Hemmerdinger Hall in the Silver Center.   NYU President John Sexton said, \u201cThis competition epitomizes the idea of NYU as a global  network university by bringing our students and faculty, regardless of location, together as part of one university in an intellectually challenging enterprise.\u201d   The Global Debate Program begins each fall with students creating teams and registering for the competition. NYU faculty, alumni, staff, graduate students, and representatives from the Bickel and Brewer Foundation serve as judges for preliminary debates in the spring semester and review videotape submissions from the other global sites to reduce the field to a &quot;sweet 16.&quot; The final rounds take place on the NYC campus, culminating in the Championship Debate on April 29, 2013 and an awards ceremony for the top 16 teams.   The Bickel &amp; Brewer \u2013 NYU Global Debate Competition is the first student activity to span NYU\u2019s  entire global network, with undergraduate debate teams from all of the University\u2019s global sites competing against one another.
