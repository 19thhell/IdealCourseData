Of course, do contact us if your question about applying is not addressed on our website or on the GSAS Application Resource Center website at http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication . Please take a look at the kinds of questions answered here:  Is there any information you can mail to me that is not online?   What are the minimum GRE scores needed to apply?    What is the minimum undergraduate GPA needed to apply?  Do I need to hold a BA in History in order to apply to your graduate program?  Is there anything I can do to strengthen my application if I did not major in History as an undergraduate?  Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply to the Doctoral program in History?  What should I include in my statement of purpose?  What is the Department looking for in the writing sample?  Are all PhD students fully-funded?  Can I study part-time?  What is the job placement record for graduates from the doctoral program?  How many people apply to the Doctoral program each year? How many are accepted?  What is the foreign language requirement? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language?  Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply for an advanced certificate in Archives or Public History?  Can I study part-time as an MA student?  What is the foreign language requirement for an MA student? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language as an MA student?  What financial aid is available for MA students?  For all applicants:    Q: Is there any information you can mail to me that is not online? A: In the interests of going green and making information readily available, we have placed all information about applying to our graduate programs and about the Department of History online. We do not have any material to send in the mail. You will find information about the Department on our website http://history.fas.nyu.edu and information about applying to the Graduate School of Arts and Science by visiting http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissions .       Q: What are the minimum GRE scores needed to apply ?    A: The GRE general test is required for admission, but there are no minimum GRE scores needed to apply. As part of admission to the department, we review all aspects of the application.    Q: What is the minimum undergraduate GPA needed to apply?    A: There is no required minimum GPA. Our successful applicants generally show an undergraduate grade point average of 3.3 or higher.    Q: Do I need to hold a BA in History in order to apply to your graduate program?    A: No. The History Department accepts students from a variety of educational backgrounds and fields.    Q: Is there anything I can do to strengthen my application if I did not major in History as an undergraduate?    A: Evaluating applicants requires making judgments about their promise for successful advanced study in history. Competitive applications might include evidence of strong writing ability, prior research experience, overall academic excellence, and the capacity to explain clearly the reasons for pursuing history rather than another field.            Q: Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply to the Doctoral program in History?    A: No, an MA is not required to apply to the Doctoral program. Some of our students enter the Doctoral program with a previous MA, and many do not.    Q: What should I include in my statement of purpose?    A: There are no set requirements for the contents of the statement of purpose. The statement of purpose will be especially useful in the evaluation if it helps us to understand your goals in pursuing an advanced degree in history, the academic experiences that led you to choose to study history, and the topics or approaches to history that you find especially engaging. Feel free to include other information that you think is important for us to have in evaluating your application. The statement should be written in clear and correct prose; it is an opportunity to showcase your writing ability.    Q: What is the Department looking for in the writing sample?    A: The required academic writing sample should not exceed 35 pages double-spaced. Choose a sample that shows writing skills relevant to the study of history, for example, the ability to draw on primary historical evidence to form and support an argument, or the ability to assess and connect with the interpretations of other historians. If you do not have training in history, choose a writing sample that demonstrates an ability to formulate arguments and mobilize evidence to support them.    Q: Are all PhD students fully-funded?      A: History doctoral students receive full funding support for five years (four for students entering with an M.A. who choose to count those credits) through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. The MacCracken Program is a fellowship that covers tuition, registration, service fees for your degree program, student health insurance, and a 9-month stipend towards expenses. For the 2013 - 2014 Academic Year, the MacCracken amount was $25,060. In addition, students receive three summers of funding. The Graduate School views teaching as a vital part of any doctoral degree. It has resonance for a student's intellectual development and professional preparation, especially for students pursuing academic careers or indeed, any career in which you must clarify ideas and speak about them persuasively. If you choose to participate in our teaching program, you will be compensated for each teaching opportunity into which you enter. This compensation is in addition to your MacCracken award.       Q: Can I study part-time?    A: No. All students are fully-funded to pursue the PhD full-time.    Q: What is the job placement record for graduates from the doctoral program?    A: Our top-tier students have been successful in securing faculty positions at public and private research universities, and at the most selective liberal arts colleges, across the nation. Please take a look: Graduate Placement &amp; Alumni News .    Q: How many people apply to the Doctoral program each year? How many are accepted?    A: We receive roughly 400 applications annually. We are able to enroll about 15 new students each year.    Q: What is the foreign language requirement? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language?    A: For doctoral students, proficiency in one modern foreign language must be demonstrated by passing the GSAS Foreign Language Proficiency exam. The exam should be passed during the first year, and must be passed before the qualifying examination for PhD students. Language requirements beyond the minimum are determined by field, and further tailored to the research of individual students. Students who require additional language training to support their research may be eligible for tuition remission to cover the cost of undergraduate language courses offered by the College of Arts and Science.         For applicants to the Master\u2019s and Certificate programs:    Q: Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply for an advanced certificate in Archives or Public History?    A: Yes, students applying for an advanced certificate must hold an MA degree (or foreign credentials equivalent to the US Master\u2019s degree).    Q: Can I study part-time as an MA student?    A: Yes, part-time study is an option. Some classes are scheduled in the evening, making it possible for a student to hold a job while pursuing his or her Master\u2019s degree or advanced certificate.    Q: What is the foreign language requirement? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language?    A: Students in the MA World History program must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a foreign language relevant to their studies by passing the GSAS Foreign Language Proficiency exam (normally taken in the first semester of study). In some cases, previous college-level work in a foreign language can substitute for the proficiency exam. There is no foreign language requirement for students in our other MA and Certificate programs.       Q: What financial aid is available for MA students?    A: Several graduate assistantships are offered to students in the Archives and Public History MA program within the archives concentration, in conjunction with Bobst Library. All applicants to the Archives and Public History MA program are automatically considered for these assistantships.    The Tuition Assistance Program for school teachers offers a 50% tuition discount to full-time primary and secondary teachers in New York City who are enrolled in the master\u2019s program in World History. Awards granted under this program are contingent on the availability of funds.    Master's students in World History are also encouraged to apply for a Foreign Language And Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship through NYU. Links to relevant departments through which students can apply appear below under GSAS funding.    The Graduate School\u2019s Tuition Incentive Program (TIP) encourages students to apply for external grants and provides matching tuition points (from 50 to 100 percent) to eligible recipients of external awards from recognized, academic sources of funding outside NYU.

Of course, do contact us if your question about applying is not addressed on our website or on the GSAS Application Resource Center website at http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication . Please take a look at the kinds of questions answered here:  Is there any information you can mail to me that is not online?   What are the minimum GRE scores needed to apply?    What is the minimum undergraduate GPA needed to apply?  Do I need to hold a BA in History in order to apply to your graduate program?  Is there anything I can do to strengthen my application if I did not major in History as an undergraduate?  Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply to the Doctoral program in History?  What should I include in my statement of purpose?  What is the Department looking for in the writing sample?  Are all PhD students fully-funded?  Can I study part-time?  What is the job placement record for graduates from the doctoral program?  How many people apply to the Doctoral program each year? How many are accepted?  What is the foreign language requirement? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language?  Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply for an advanced certificate in Archives or Public History?  Can I study part-time as an MA student?  What is the foreign language requirement for an MA student? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language as an MA student?  What financial aid is available for MA students?  For all applicants:    Q: Is there any information you can mail to me that is not online? A: In the interests of going green and making information readily available, we have placed all information about applying to our graduate programs and about the Department of History online. We do not have any material to send in the mail. You will find information about the Department on our website http://history.fas.nyu.edu and information about applying to the Graduate School of Arts and Science by visiting http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissions .       Q: What are the minimum GRE scores needed to apply ?    A: The GRE general test is required for admission, but there are no minimum GRE scores needed to apply. As part of admission to the department, we review all aspects of the application.    Q: What is the minimum undergraduate GPA needed to apply?    A: There is no required minimum GPA. Our successful applicants generally show an undergraduate grade point average of 3.3 or higher.    Q: Do I need to hold a BA in History in order to apply to your graduate program?    A: No. The History Department accepts students from a variety of educational backgrounds and fields.    Q: Is there anything I can do to strengthen my application if I did not major in History as an undergraduate?    A: Evaluating applicants requires making judgments about their promise for successful advanced study in history. Competitive applications might include evidence of strong writing ability, prior research experience, overall academic excellence, and the capacity to explain clearly the reasons for pursuing history rather than another field.            Q: Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply to the Doctoral program in History?    A: No, an MA is not required to apply to the Doctoral program. Some of our students enter the Doctoral program with a previous MA, and many do not.    Q: What should I include in my statement of purpose?    A: There are no set requirements for the contents of the statement of purpose. The statement of purpose will be especially useful in the evaluation if it helps us to understand your goals in pursuing an advanced degree in history, the academic experiences that led you to choose to study history, and the topics or approaches to history that you find especially engaging. Feel free to include other information that you think is important for us to have in evaluating your application. The statement should be written in clear and correct prose; it is an opportunity to showcase your writing ability.    Q: What is the Department looking for in the writing sample?    A: The required academic writing sample should not exceed 35 pages double-spaced. Choose a sample that shows writing skills relevant to the study of history, for example, the ability to draw on primary historical evidence to form and support an argument, or the ability to assess and connect with the interpretations of other historians. If you do not have training in history, choose a writing sample that demonstrates an ability to formulate arguments and mobilize evidence to support them.    Q: Are all PhD students fully-funded?      A: History doctoral students receive full funding support for five years (four for students entering with an M.A. who choose to count those credits) through the Henry M. MacCracken Program. The MacCracken Program is a fellowship that covers tuition, registration, service fees for your degree program, student health insurance, and a 9-month stipend towards expenses. For the 2013 - 2014 Academic Year, the MacCracken amount was $25,060. In addition, students receive three summers of funding. The Graduate School views teaching as a vital part of any doctoral degree. It has resonance for a student's intellectual development and professional preparation, especially for students pursuing academic careers or indeed, any career in which you must clarify ideas and speak about them persuasively. If you choose to participate in our teaching program, you will be compensated for each teaching opportunity into which you enter. This compensation is in addition to your MacCracken award.       Q: Can I study part-time?    A: No. All students are fully-funded to pursue the PhD full-time.    Q: What is the job placement record for graduates from the doctoral program?    A: Our top-tier students have been successful in securing faculty positions at public and private research universities, and at the most selective liberal arts colleges, across the nation.

We are able to enroll about 15 new students each year.    Q: What is the foreign language requirement? Do I need to enter the program with proficiency in a foreign language?    A: For doctoral students, proficiency in one modern foreign language must be demonstrated by passing the GSAS Foreign Language Proficiency exam. The exam should be passed during the first year, and must be passed before the qualifying examination for PhD students. Language requirements beyond the minimum are determined by field, and further tailored to the research of individual students. Students who require additional language training to support their research may be eligible for tuition remission to cover the cost of undergraduate language courses offered by the College of Arts and Science.         For applicants to the Master\u2019s and Certificate programs:    Q: Do I need to have a Master\u2019s degree to apply for an advanced certificate in Archives or Public History?    A: Yes, students applying for an advanced certificate must hold an MA degree (or foreign credentials equivalent to the US Master\u2019s degree).    Q: Can I study part-time as an MA student?    A: Yes, part-time study is an option.

Focuses on the history of records and record keeping, development of archival theory, appraisal, arrangement and description, reference, legal and ethical issues, and current trends in the profession.                  HIST-GA.1012 Historical Editing Seminar         Introduces students to the theories, practices, and problems involved in editing and publishing historical documents. Students develop their own documentary editions complete with prefatory material, transcriptions, annotations, and calendars. Focuses especially on project leadership and includes an electronic edition component.              HIST-GA.1151 Literature of the Field: Modern Europe        This class introduces graduate students to major debates, problems and categories in European historiography on the period from the mid nineteenth to the late twentieth centuries. The emphasis is on methodological and analytical questions. Topics include nationalism, fascism, capitalism, colonialism, total war, cities, science, and subjectivity.              HIST-GA.1156 What is Europe?        Examines the formation of the European nation-state starting with the French Revolution. Provides an overview of key issues, including citizenship, exclusion, immigration, identity, nationalism, security, and the creation of the European Union and its policy formation.               HIST-GA.1201 Lit of the Field: Colonial Latin America        Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the colonial Latin American field. Required for PhD students in Latin American and Caribbean History.                  HIST-GA.1209 19th Century France: France and its Empire 1750-1800s    France and Its Empire, 1750-1880s focuses on the revolutionary period of modern France. This was a tumultuous and creative time, a time of revolution and reaction, republics and monarchies, liberalism and centralized power. We will study this period in three principal ways: by learning about the various regimes, politics, ideologies, and social patterns that marked the era; by reading documents written during this time and texts composed by some of its principal figures; and by analyzing selected works of present-day historical scholarship that help us understand modern France.         As we build this understanding, our thinking will be guided by the following questions: Why was it so difficult during the century following the French Revolution for France to develop a stable political regime? Why, in this connection, did France irrupt into revolution in response to the problems it faced? And to what extent did the French Revolution define the nature and meaning of the period that followed it? Finally, what was the role of France\u2019s empire, and how did colonialism square with the effort to build a stable republican regime?        The French Revolution is fundamental not just to French history but to world history. For this reason, we will devote considerable attention to the origins and meaning of this event. We will also consider the subsequent revolutions of the nineteenth century revolutions and examine the extent to which France became a modern society in the second half of the nineteenth century.                     HIST-GA.1326 Russia: Law and Empire, 16th-21st Century     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.1416 History of Modern Ireland I     Early-modern Irish history is an epic tale of conflict, subjugation, and the struggle for national identity. In the roughly two and a half centuries covered by this course, Ireland was transformed from a mysterious and remote island on the periphery of Europe to a quasi-autonomous state fully caught up in the sweeping economic, political, and social transformations that defined the late eighteenth century. Among the topics covered in History I are the Tudor conquest and colonization; Gaelic pushback; Ireland under the Stuarts; the Williamite War and formation of the Protestant Ascendancy; the emergence of Irish nationalism; Ireland and the Enlightenment; 18th-century political, economic, and societal transformations; and Ireland in the Age of Revolutions. The struggles and frustrations of this period define the agenda for Ireland\u2019s tumultuous passage through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.             HIST-GA.1421 Debates in Modern Irish History     This course seeks to analyze a selection of the intense debates in Ireland itself and abroad, especially in Britain and the USA, that characterize modern Irish history, concentrating on topics that transcend the specific Irish experience to raise issues of wider human import. It is equally a study of events and of their interpretation from various contested perspectives, and thus requires intense engagement with the historiography, and with the study of history as a mode of thought. The topics to be explored include the issues of Conquest, Collaboration, Assimilation and Resistance, viewed through the prism of Ireland and the British Empire, as reflected in a number of major topics, including: The Act of Union; The Great Irish Famine; Irish Diaspora; Issues of Irish Identity (as seen through Irish and British eyes via historical movements and events); the ethno-religious conflict in Northern Ireland since 1968; Ireland and Globalization.              HIST-GA.1441 History and Historiography of Irish America     The Irish are one of the most significant ethnic groups to ever migrate from Europe to the United States. Their impact has been disproportional to their numbers but this only partially explains our contemporary understanding of \u201cIrish America.\u201d This seminar will explore how the history of Irish immigrants and their descendants in the United States has been written over the past century and a half. Students will evaluate books and documentary films that have been influential in constructing the narrative of the Irish in America, in addition to article literature. The goal is to learn how to separate historical content from historiography and to see how both can influence popular perceptions of an ethnic people.              HIST-GA.1521 Medieval Marriage     This course will explore the practical experience of marriage in the Middle Ages. We will be looking at the lay experience of the stages of married life (from courting and wedding to annulment and death) in all its gendered aspects. For each of the thematic sessions we will explore as much as possible the experience across the whole social range from aristocracy to peasants. Although our focus will be on the Christian Middle Ages of western Europe we will devote ample space to comparative aspects in Islamic and Jewish culture especially for the Mediterranean area. Thematic sessions will centre on exogamy (intermarriage) in mixed faith and ethnic circumstances, polygamy and concubinage, remarriage and step family relationships, male power and female obedience and the memorialisation of married life. We will also explore alternative forms of cohabitation in a sexual or celibate manner. Wherever possible special attention will be paid to the material culture of marriage, such as the domestic arrangement in the houses, living and sleeping quarters and moveable possessions.              HIST-GA.1562 Lit of the Field: Africa     This course introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for African history.              HIST-GA.1600 Literature of the Field: US to 1877     A reading course covering the earlier period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.              HIST-GA.1646 Materializing in the Middle Ages     The theme of the seminar, materiality, is concerned with the tangible stuff of medieval lives, with those materials: animal parts, vegetable fibers, metal, stones, clay, wood, that were used and processed into finished objects: comestibles, clothing, homes and monuments, artifacts and ornaments, images and the media of written and visual communication. As they emerged from raw materials, things affected social relations and cultural perception, enabling action and provoking reaction. We will consider, for example, the effects of pageantry, with its elaborate display of culinary, heraldic, and sartorial splendor, in asserting and maintaining chivalric claims to dominance. We will examine recent archeological findings to understand the ways that, through accessories to their dress, peasants resisted and re-fashioned the identities imposed upon them by medieval elites. Objects, thus, shaped history, yet historians tend to write history based upon texts. Avoiding such an exclusive dependency requires methodological reflection. Stimulated by the work of social scientists such as Jane Bennett, Alfred Gell, Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour, and Bjrnar Olsen, lively debates are currently taking place about the theory, goals, and relevance of material culture studies, and we will develop our own perspectives on the issues at stake. Assessing the participation, meaning, and agency of things in pre-modern lives forces to question boundaries and to put them in a newer historical perspective: the relationships between humans and animals (and nature), between humans and technology, body and soul, images and memory, the animate and the inanimate. Our exploration of the connections between human and non-human environments will consider the appropriation of animal skins in the production of writing; the extension of human personhood via the use of animal power, tools, weapons, images, and memory aids; human involvement with a living landscape of holy trees, sacred groves and springs, and powerful stars; attitudes toward idols and automata; the perception of art as vibrant matter. Though modern theory inspires historians and art historians to seek agency in a network of social and material relationships, medieval intellectuals were more cautious in their belief in the power of matter. In fact, for many, the materiality of the human body was suspicious, as was knowledge that depended upon the mediation of the senses. Such \u2018carnal\u2019 knowledge was ascribed to minorities (Jews) and alleged dissenters (magi, witches). Materiality in the Middle Ages was a philosophical topic fraught with ambivalence, imbued with a potential for violence.              HIST-GA.1750 Intro to Public History     Reviews the history of public history, focusing on historians\u2019 relationships, dialogues, and collaborations with public audiences. Considers issues involving memory, identity, heritage, commemoration, historic preservation, history museums, historic sites, oral history, and digital history. Final project involves a collaborative endeavor with a local public history institution.               HIST-GA.1763 Approaches to History of Women and Gender     This course is intended as an introduction to some of the central methodological and interpretive issues involved in the historical study of women and gender. We consider the development of women\u2019s history as a field from the 1960s, the historiographies that have shaped women\u2019s history (and been influenced by it), the introduction of gender as an analytical category, the interpretive models that have structured writing about women and gender in the past, and the particular challenges involved in researching subjects who have often left little trace in the historic record. This is not a nation-based survey of women\u2019s history. Instead, our approach is comparative. We will read works that have had a significant impact on the development of the field, works that model particular methodological or interpretive approaches, and works by faculty at NYU. We will also consider contemporary reflections on the state of the field, both in the US and internationally .               HIST-GA.1773 Society &amp; Culture: 20th Century America     This is a graduate level research seminar on the social and cultural history of the United States in the twentieth-century. The central project of the course will be each student\u2019s development of an extended, article-length essay based on original research. Considerable class time will be dedicated to preliminary discussions of each research problematic and its relevant historiographies. Research takes time, as does writing and re-writing; papers are NOT written in one sitting or in a single draft. Accordingly, students will be required to develop their research in the first weeks, even as readings and discussion proceed and present finished drafts in class that will be revised for final submission.        Although the seminar is not be readings course or colloquium, the first half of the semester will include readings to introduce some theoretical tools and writing strategies. Introductory readings and wider reading around the relevant historiographies that the various students\u2019 research problematic engages, and shared reading of the research essays of others will also expose students to a broad a range of subjects in the literature in social and cultural history. The subject is cast broadly to allow for diverse student research interests, but will be limited to the long 20th century (from ca. 1890 to the present).              HIST-GA.1782 African American History     Broad exposure to African American history. Begins with a historiographical introduction, describing the growth and development of the field, and moves to a major theme and period treatment ranging from ancient Africa to the civil rights movement. Provides an understanding of the field and a foundation for specialized course work and research.              HIST-GA.1981 Migration History and Theory: The Italian Case as Litmus Test     The course begins with the assumption that mobility is the norm in human history and it will focus on the case of Italy \u2013 a geographically well-defined peninsula, which for centuries has been at the crossroad of demographic movements \u2013 as an ideal example of what kind of socio-cultural transformations can be consequence of population mobility in every society and context. The course will draw on the lessons from the various theories of migration to analyze the way in which Italy's human landscape has been affected by migratory flows and the social, cultural, political impacts these in- and out-flows have originated in the course of history. It will first provide an overview of the state of the art in the field of international migration theories, with a view to clarify any conceptual distinctions between the terms migration, immigration, mobility, diasporas, etc. Then, we will explore some key pathways that will form the focus of the transformations: a) the arts \u2013 literary and visual; b) institutions and laws \u2013 juridical concerns in controlling flows and identifying status and memberships; c) familial/societal structures; d) entrepreneurship and economic culture. Finally, the course will discuss to what extent and in what manner population movements have been forging states and societies and, through the Italian case, will reflect upon the role of mobility as a key dynamic in globalization. The course is addressed to those students with basic knowledge of Italian migration history and/or interest in migration studies, who intend to enhance their knowledge both of international migration theory and the history of Italian global migrations. The main aim of the course is to provide the students with effective tools to develop critical thinking on human mobility.              HIST-GA.2022 MA Proseminar     Introduction to the theoretical and methodological components involved in the research process. Considers historiographical issues; develops an understanding of the archival and library environments, focusing on searching strategies and the use of automated techniques; and emphasizes framing research questions. Students complete a research paper with appropriate documentation and bibliography in their area of interest.              HIST-GA.2031 Advanced Archival Description     Provides an understanding of archival descriptive standards and practices. Focuses on the development and use of bibliographic standards to create and exchange data concerning archival records. Particular emphases include the MARC format; the development, implementation, and evaluation of Encoded Archival Description and Encoded Archival Context; content management systems; digital encoding standards; and digital library development.               HIST-GA.2033 Creating Digital History     Historians who work with the public have a particular need to be confidant with digital tools. The course offers students a hands-on primer in the skills archivist and historians need to create, contribute to, and use web-based historical sites. Students will gain experience digitizing historical materials for preservation and access, creating structured metadata and folksonomies to describe historical objects, conducting online historical research and presenting the results of that research online in the form of blog posts and an online digital exhibit. Projects will center around the history of Greenwich Village and be publicly accessible at htttp://aphdigital.org/GVH. Class discussions will focus on current topics in digital humanities and how they impact the making of digital history sites.               HIST-GA.2122 Empire, Nation, Globalization     Empire and globalization lie at the heart of the spatial turn in academic work during the last several decades. This graduate seminar is designed to enrich student research in various disciplines by exploring empire and globalization as features of modern spatial history. We focus on imperial Britain and the United States and on globalization in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and in most detail, on South Asia. Spatial history begins with the premise that various scalar forms of social space and social power relations are meaningfully connected to one another. Localities weave into regions, continents, and global spaces. Expanding spaces of social power affect everyday life in smaller spaces, right down to New York neighborhoods and mountain hamlets in the Global South. The scale and impact of meaningful spatial interaction pose problems for historical study. Empire and nation do not necessarily form dominant spatial frames. Space is not a stage or container, but rather a permanently ongoing construction project, at all scalar levels. Spatial history entails the study of interactive, changing spaces over time, configured by social power of many kinds at many levels of scale. This course is designed to stimulate, support, and inform student research. Before mid-term, we read and discuss assigned texts. Each week, we focus on one theme, which we develop according to student interest. The bibliography at the end of the syllabus is a work-in-progress, providing resources for further work. After mid-term, we focus on student research. Each student should join the class with a research idea to work with all term. This idea can be very vague to begin with; it can derive from other courses or outside projects. Student work for the course includes weekly reading and one-page weekly essays to prepare for class. Students and instructor meet individually at mid-term to develop research ideas and devise readings for the remainder of the term. Ideas for final week readings also appear at the end of the syllabus. Students present their work in class at the end of the term. A research paper is due on the last day of university classes.                 HIST-GA.2150 Fiction, Historiography &amp; the Event     In this seminar we will examine the construction, disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability; the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune.

HIST-GA.2163 European Conceptions of the New Man, 1789-1945     This course concerns a fundamental fantasy of modern European thought, art, and culture, the figure of the \u201cNew Man\u201d in the period 1789-1939\u2014a figure that expressed the idea that human society and even human nature could and should be regenerated through political, philosophical, and aesthetic means. The course is intended as an engagement with a series of further questions: problems of modernity, secularism, humanism and time; methodological questions pertinent to intellectual and conceptual history as well as theory, comparative literature, and political theory: it is thus aimed at once at students with historical but also literary and political-science backgrounds. We will read a mixture of primary and secondary sources.              HIST-GA.2168 Methods and Approaches to World History     Description forthcoming. In the meantime, please contact the professor directly.             HIST-GA.2655 Morning in America: Ronald Reagan, the Nuclear Crisis, and the Cold War of the 1980s          This course seeks to place the final decade of the Cold War in historical perspective by focusing on the intertwinement of domestic and foreign policy during the Reagan administration. It explores the emergence of the neoconservative movement, the \u201cReagan revolution,\u201d the effects of \u201cReaganomics\u201d and the military buildup, and the ascent of Evangelical Christianity as a political factor. It also retraces the debates surrounding the role of government, social responsibility, the welfare state and public health care system, shifting value systems, and technological innovation, as well as their representations in society and popular culture. Merging an \u201cestablishment\u201d perspective with an analysis of protest cultures, the course examines Reagan\u2019s foreign policy of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d with regard to the Soviet Union from a global perspective, analyzing the nuclear threat and the renewed arms race, his policies toward Europe and Central America, Iran-Contra, the question of human rights in East-West diplomacy, and the controversy, widespread opposition, and grassroots activism these issues triggered both at home and abroad. Readings include the most recent and influential scholarship on this period as well as a variety of primary sources.             HIST-GA.2707 The Agrarian Question in History     This course will explore the emergence of what was called the \u201cAgrarian Question\u201d in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as that question was related to the emergence of industrialization and the question of value, problems of domestic and global revolution, and the issues of modernization and development in Europe and the non-Western world. We will trace the evolution of the question from its physiocratic core, through its articulation in Smith, Marx, the Soviet Union, Peru, and into the later twentieth century as part of the 'peasant problem.' The last part of the semester will be devoted to studying how this question has re-emerged in today\u2019s China, as a problem of development, where the peasantry persists. The aim of the class is to familiarize students with some of the basic philosophical and historical texts surrounding problems of development and culture, as they pertain to the agrarian question in China and elsewhere and to assist students in analyzing contemporary problems through a longer historical perspective. A lot of reading and a research paper at the end are basic requirements. Students from all geographical specializations welcome; MA students should write for permission to register.              HIST-GA.2901 Captivity, Displacement, and Migration     This course explores questions of voluntary and involuntary movement across the greater Ottoman and Mediterranean worlds. The emphasis is on the early modern period, especially the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, heyday of corsairs, renegades, captives, and converts. (Participants interested in other periods may write final papers accordingly.) The Ottoman empire, with its particular brand of imperial slavery and its forms of economic and household slavery, is a principal, although not exclusive, focus of the course; the \u201cGrand Turk\u201d looms large even when not a direct protagonist of events. The Eurasian and Mediterranean frontiers of the empire and the peoples who crossed them are emphasized. The majority of the readings are recent monographs; we will also read contemporary narratives. Occasional guest speakers will share their expertise in the themes of the course.

HIST-GA.3330 Guantanamo Public Memory Project at NYU     This class will bring together Museum Studies, Public History and CLACS students into a nationwide collaboration facilitated by the Guantanamo Public Memory Project. The class will seek to trace the complex history of Guantanomo Bay via the project\u2019s collation of oral history, documentary and photographic, and material culture pertaining to the facility. This history will be framed within a broader set of questions about the politics of archives, the ethics of historical narratives, the techniques and technologies that make history present for the public and the constitution of public consciousness via engagement with images, text and testimony. The class will coordinate, create and curate an exhibition that will draw content from 8 similar classes held in graduate programs across the country (the exhibition itself will travel subsequently to each of the venues). The exhibition will be held at NYU in the Kimmel Windows gallery space \u2013 a 24 hour accessible series of vitrines on the intersection of West 3 rd street and LaGuardia Place. NYU students will curate this exhibition, create digital and other content and coordinate a large international symposium to be held at the exhibition\u2019s opening.              HIST-GA.3603 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.              HIST-GA.3701 Creation of the Constitution     The course begins with readings setting forth the intellectual and experiential background of the framing, including common law and natural rights theory, republicanism, economic &amp; political scientific ideas, and colonial and post-Independence experience. We then study large parts of the debates at the Constitutional Convention, primarily using Madison's Notes. Next come the ratification debates, including readings from antifederalist writers, about half of The Federalist, and overviews of the Virginia and New York ratification conventions. We conclude with the addition of the Bill of Rights. Classes consist of a combination of lecture and extensive participation by students.
