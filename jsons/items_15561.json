The University\u2019s renovation of the 500,000 square-foot building \u2013 which will serve as the home of NYU\u2019s Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), one of the City\u2019s designated \u201cgenius schools\u201d to help foster New York\u2019s fledgling tech/innovation economy \u2013 will also house NYU\u2019s highly-regarded entrepreneurial incubators, as well as additional classrooms and office space for various NYU programs. The revitalization of the property is the latest move by NYU to expand its presence in Brooklyn. Earlier this year, NYU completed its merger with Polytechnic Institute to become NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, returning the engineering discipline to NYU after a 40 year gap.     The unoccupied 14-story building \u2013 originally home to the NYC Transit Authority \u2013 currently houses MTA communications equipment and sits above an active subway station. In its underutilized condition, the nearly vacant building has been an impediment to the full emergence of Brooklyn\u2019s booming downtown as a technological hub for New York City.     \u201cApplied science, technology, and engineering are among our fastest growing academic areas and the new 370 Jay Street \u2013 in the heart of a thriving tech corridor \u2013 will be an environment conducive to inspiration and innovation in those fields,\u201d said Lynne Brown, NYU senior vice president for University Relations and Public Affairs. \u201c370 Jay Street will give us the opportunity to promote research and learning not just in Brooklyn, but with programs across the entire University.\u201d     \u201cThe new 370 Jay Street will come alive with the sounds of learning and innovation, as NYU\u2019s CUSP becomes its latest and greatest tenant. I am pleased to support a project that embraces sustainable construction and energy efficiency, as Brooklyn looks to be a leader in these areas,\u201d said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. \u201cOur borough will continue to benefit from the great ideas that will emerge from 370 Jay Street, from world-class education to creative entrepreneurship.\u201d     Originally designed by William E. Haugaard and Andrew J. Thomas, the building was hailed as one of the most important buildings of the post-World War II era and a master of the genre of Modernist office buildings when it opened in 1951. Its efficient design \u2013 which allows natural light to reach the center of each floor plate \u2013 was viewed as a template for public office buildings for decades.     Mitchell Giurgola Architects have undertaken the building\u2019s adaptive reuse with an eye toward the research and learning it will house, incorporating several sustainable elements. The full limestone and steel fa\u00e7ade will be restored rather than replaced \u2013 thereby reducing the amount of waste that would be sent to a landfill by approximately 4,000 cubic yards. More than 1,000 energy-efficient windows will be installed adding a significant, sun-induced design element to the facade.     The building will undergo abatement and receive new mechanical, plumbing, and electrical systems with a one megawatt micro turbine. The design keeps the building contextual with the aesthetics of the surrounding buildings and neighborhood. Skanska USA is serving as the project\u2019s construction manager and Atelier Ten is serving as the sustainability consultant.     \u201cWe did a careful examination on how to adaptively reuse the building without creating a significant amount of waste,\u201d said Andrew Repoli, project manager for NYU. \u201cWe looked at various green-building features, but found there was no sustainable benefit to stripping off the original fa\u00e7ade. Instead, we incorporated it into our design. Equally as important, this design aligns our approach with CUSP\u2019s mission of helping cities operate more efficiently.\u201d     CUSP will be located on the top three floors of the 14-story building and the three incubators \u2013 Urban Future Lab in Downtown Brooklyn, Varick Street Incubator in Manhattan and the DUMBO Incubator \u2013 will be consolidated to the third floor. The remainder of the building will be used by NYU for classrooms and other academic uses, with the exception of 14,000 square of retail on the ground floor. The project requires approval by the Public Design Commission and will begin construction in 2015 and is expected to be completed by 2017.

With construction beginning now on approximately 26,000 square feet of space in 1 MetroTech Center, CUSP will occupy the MetroTech space, leased to the University by Forest City Ratner Companies, in February 2013 as NYU continues to transform the former Metropolitan Transit Authority facility at 370 Jay Street into its permanent home.   CUSP's facilities at MetroTech and 370 Jay Street \u2013 which will eventually total more than half a million square feet \u2013 will build on NYU's existing presence in Brooklyn, which includes NYU-Poly, by bringing together global leaders of science, technology, and education while anchoring the next phase of economic development initiatives in the area. CUSP, one of the winning proposals submitted in response to the City's Applied Sciences NYC initiative, will, at full strength, include 50 researchers and faculty members from universities and private industry, along with more than 400 Masters students and 100 Ph.D. candidates, as well as adjuncts, post-doctoral scholars and support staff.   &quot;The innovative faculty and students at CUSP will set out to tackle urban challenges and bring innovative solutions to a world market, and it's only appropriate that we begin shaping these ideas in Brooklyn \u2013 one of the most dynamic neighborhoods in the world,&quot; said Steven Koonin, Director of CUSP. &quot;There is no place better to be doing this work, and we look forward to working with Brooklyn and NYC to create new partnerships, urban products, companies and jobs.&quot;   &quot;CUSP will have a monumental impact on our City's economy, generating $5.5 billion in nominal economic activity, creating more than 7,000 jobs, and spinning off 200 companies over the coming decades,&quot; said New York City Economic Development Corporation President Seth W. Pinsky. &quot;At the same time, the academic programs and cutting-edge research generated by this institution will help solve some of the major modern challenges that large cities like New York City are certain to face. I am pleased to welcome CUSP to Brooklyn, where it will play a critical role for our City for generations.&quot;   &quot;With NYU's Center for Urban Science and Progress, Brooklyn will further cement its status as \u2018College Town, U-S-A' - with more college students than even Cambridge, Massachusetts,&quot; said Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz. &quot;I have been a strong advocate for the redevelopment of 370 Jay into a job-creating applied sciences epicenter, and as NYU continues to expand in our borough, they clearly understand that Brooklyn is the place to be\u2014and learn. With CUSP's presence as a high-tech education hub at MetroTech and 370 Jay in Downtown Brooklyn, the new 40,000-square-foot business incubator at NYU-Poly, and the emergence of the Tech Triangle and growth of our hi-tech small businesses, Brooklyn is undoubtedly the next Silicon Valley. Congratulations to CUSP on the occasion of its inaugural class, and bravo to the 50 students who will soon be building the Brooklyn of tomorrow!&quot;   &quot;In a few short years NYU has made a very strong impression on the Downtown Brooklyn area,&quot; said MaryAnne Gilmartin, Executive Vice President for Forest City Ratner Companies. &quot;With the addition of CUSP, MetroTech Center and Downtown Brooklyn as a whole continue to emerge as a hub of technology and innovation in New York City.&quot;   &quot;Already known as New York City's Collegetown, Downtown Brooklyn will be forever changed by the commitment that NYU is making here today,&quot; said Tucker Reed, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership. &quot;The opening of CUSP will truly signal our arrival as a center for innovation, creativity, and entrepreneurship.&quot;   Features of the Center's immediate space at 1 MetroTech include:     Eighty-three offices and workstations for faculty, visiting industrial researchers, administrators, and staff.   Four easily reconfigured collaborative spaces at the corners of the building that give everyone working at CUSP access to views of the city they are studying.   Two large visualization labs which will allow researchers to gain insight and understanding of large urban data sets or phenomena that are simulated in large, complex computer models.   An electronics lab for the design and fabrication of low-cost hardware that collects validated, crowd-sourced urban data.      NYU has completed its assessment of 370 Jay Street and full construction will take an estimated five years. Putting the long-empty building to use would create a hub for science and technology that connects the emerging tech community in Downtown Brooklyn and the surrounding neighborhoods with CUSP, as well as Poly's existing campus, adding to the economic vibrancy of the area. The City and NYU will transform 370 Jay Street into CUSP classrooms, offices, and laboratory space. An additional 40,000 square feet will be used in coordination with NYU-Poly as incubator space for businesses spun off by CUSP-related research.   CUSP is an applied science research institute created by New York University and NYU-Poly with a consortium of world-class universities and leading international tech companies. At the heart of its academic program, CUSP will investigate and develop solutions to the challenges that face cities around the world. The Center will be the first program to assemble a global consortium to focus on this area of research and development at this scale, making it the world's leading authority in the emerging field of &quot;urban informatics.&quot;                          This Press Release is in the following Topics:      NYUToday-feature , New York City , MetroTech , Brooklyn , Center for Urban Science and Progress           Type: Press Release            Press Contact:                Kim Alfred |                                                             Search News                                       Keywords:                          Select a School             Arts and Science         College of Arts and Science         College of Dentistry         College of Nursing         Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences         Division of Libraries         Gallatin School of Individualized Study         Graduate School of Arts and Science         Institute for the Study of the Ancient World         Institute of Fine Arts         Leonard N.
