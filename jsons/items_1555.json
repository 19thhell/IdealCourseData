In the early 19th century, the   major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with   little attention given to modern subjects. The founders of New York University   intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of those   aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in   law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in   1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a new university   that fed off the energy and vibrancy of the city.    The   first president of New York University's governing council was Albert Gallatin,   former adviser to Thomas Jefferson and secretary of the treasury in Jefferson's   cabinet. Gallatin and his cofounders envisioned a \"national university\" that   would provide a \"rational and practical education for all.\"    The   result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both   nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. NYU is one of   only 60 universities in the nation to have membership in the distinguished   Association of American Universities. Students come to NYU from all 50 states   and from 145 foreign   countries.    New   York University includes three degree-granting campuses: New York, United   States; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai, China. In addition, the   University has 11 global academic centers: Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany;   Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, United Kingdom; Madrid,   Spain; Paris, France; Prague, Czech Republic; Sydney, Australia; Tel Aviv,   Israel; and Washington, DC, United States. Although overall the University is   large, the divisions are small- to moderate-size units\u2014each with its own   traditions, programs, and faculty.    Enrollment   in the undergraduate divisions at NYU ranges between 124 and 7,341, and the   University offers over 9,000 courses and grants more than 25 different degrees.   Classes vary in size, but the University strives to create a sense of community   among students within and among the different disciplines.

In the early 19th century, the   major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with   little attention given to modern subjects. The founders of New York University   intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of those   aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in   law, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in   1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a new university   that fed off the energy and vibrancy of the city.    The   first president of New York University's governing council was Albert Gallatin,   former adviser to Thomas Jefferson and secretary of the treasury in Jefferson's   cabinet. Gallatin and his cofounders envisioned a \"national university\" that   would provide a \"rational and practical education for all.\"    The   result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both   nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. NYU is one of   only 60 universities in the nation to have membership in the distinguished   Association of American Universities. Students come to NYU from all 50 states   and from 145 foreign   countries.    New   York University includes three degree-granting campuses: New York, United   States; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai, China. In addition, the   University has 11 global academic centers: Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany;   Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, United Kingdom; Madrid,   Spain; Paris, France; Prague, Czech Republic; Sydney, Australia; Tel Aviv,   Israel; and Washington, DC, United States. Although overall the University is   large, the divisions are small- to moderate-size units\u2014each with its own   traditions, programs, and faculty.    Enrollment   in the undergraduate divisions at NYU ranges between 124 and 7,341, and the   University offers over 9,000 courses and grants more than 25 different degrees.   Classes vary in size, but the University strives to create a sense of community   among students within and among the different disciplines.
