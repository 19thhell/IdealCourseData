Usually you look in an index by subject. However, most indexes allow users to search on a variety of criteria, including author, title, source or document type. Once you have found citations, the next step is to check if Bobst Library owns the source and then to determine the location of the source. For more information about finding journal articles please consult the article tutorial at http://library.nyu.edu/research/tutorials/ , or ask a librarian at one of the reference centers in Bobst Library. The resources listed below typically focus on the study of gender or sexuality, however there are a number of other major indexes and abstracts that are appropriate for the study of gender and sexuality.

Because of the explosion of research in Women's Studies during the past two decades, scholars and students interested in women during the Middle Ages find an ever-growing flood of publications. Identifying relevant works in this mass of material is further complicated by the interdisciplinary nature of much of the scholarship. In order to help researchers find current articles and essays quickly and easily, librarians and scholars began compiling the Feminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index in July 1996. Books written by a single author are not indexed in Feminae; for these, check library catalogs that have strong collections in medieval studies.     GenderWatch .

Usually you look in an index by subject. However, most indexes allow users to search on a variety of criteria, including author, title, source or document type. Once you have found citations, the next step is to check if Bobst Library owns the source and then to determine the location of the source. For more information about finding journal articles please consult the article tutorial at http://library.nyu.edu/research/tutorials/ , or ask a librarian at one of the reference centers in Bobst Library. The resources listed below typically focus on the study of gender or sexuality, however there are a number of other major indexes and abstracts that are appropriate for the study of gender and sexuality. Please see the related research guides at the end of this page to learn more about them.     Contemporary Women's Issues .

Schaus Internet: http://library.nyu.edu/collections/find_articles_title.html From the Resource: Feminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index covers journal articles, book reviews, and essays in books about women, sexuality, and gender during the Middle Ages. Because of the explosion of research in Women's Studies during the past two decades, scholars and students interested in women during the Middle Ages find an ever-growing flood of publications. Identifying relevant works in this mass of material is further complicated by the interdisciplinary nature of much of the scholarship. In order to help researchers find current articles and essays quickly and easily, librarians and scholars began compiling the Feminae: Medieval Women and Gender Index in July 1996. Books written by a single author are not indexed in Feminae; for these, check library catalogs that have strong collections in medieval studies.     GenderWatch .

At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture. Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging of some categories (i.e., male or heterosexual) over others, along with the social and political implications of such hierarchies. Our curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is often presented as \"natural\" or \"normal\" in traditional academic curricula.
