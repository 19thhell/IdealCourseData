While fiction and   literary criticism are excluded, nominated books may combine literature   with other disciplines. Books may be written in English or French, but   the author must reside in North America. Preference is given to scholars   in the early years of their career (assistant or associate professors).   Present members of the prize committee are Professors Tom Conley   (Harvard), St\u00e9phane Gerson (NYU), Brigitte Lane (Tufts), Brian Martin   (Williams), and Helen Solterer (Duke, Chair). The call for   nominations for the next Wylie Prize in French Cultural Studies will go   out in late 2015. Books published in 2014 and 2015 will be eligible. The 2012-2013 Laurence Wylie Prize in French and Francophone Cultural Studies has been awarded to Professor Brett Rushforth for his book Bonds of Alliance: Indigenous &amp; Atlantic Slaveries in New France  (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2012). Forty books were submitted for consideration, all of them published in 2012 or 2013. Professor Rushforth is Associate Professor of History at William and Mary College. Professor Rushforth received his prize at Duke University on November 7 ( http://sites.duke.edu/cffs/wylie-prize/ ). On this occasion, he spoke at a roundtable around Bonds of Alliance that included other scholars working in French and Francophone studies as well as in American history. The roundtable was held at Duke University\u2019s Forum for Scholars and Publics. Participating respondents included Laurent Dubois (Duke University), Thavolia Glymph (Duke University), Lloyd Kramer (UNC-CH), and Ellen Welch (UNC-CH). Helen Solterer (Duke University, chair of the 2012-2013 Wylie Prize) organized and moderated this event.
