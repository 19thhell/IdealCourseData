Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory ENGL-UA 735 Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every year. 4 points. Topics vary from term to term. Representations of Women ENGL-UA 755 Identical to SCA-UA 734. Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every other year. 4 points. Broadly speaking, feminist theory and studies have been concerned with three central problems or issues: (1) describing the organization of power differences between men and women, (2) explaining the \u201corigins\u201d of sexual and gender difference, and (3) accounting for differences among women (and among men) that complicate notions of sexual and gender difference. This course surveys representations of sexual and gender difference in literary and cultural production, focusing especially on texts authored by women. Students consider theories of gender and sexuality that enable us to consider how literature depicts and engages social relations and, conversely, how our reading practices enact (or transform) social conventions regarding gender difference.
