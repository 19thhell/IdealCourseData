The counseling relationship differs from both social friendships and patient-doctor contacts. Unlike friends, counselors are able to be objective; they are not involved in your daily lives. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal effectively with problems. Read more...          Psychiatry     Our innovative model for psychiatric medication management services provides students with access to psychiatric medication services throughout their NYU career at a maximum out-of-pocket expense of $30 per visit.

Group Counseling     Sometimes a problem is better addressed through group counseling than individual appointments.

A counseling group can be powerfully healing - for some students, one of the most rewarding experiences during their NYU years. To sign up for a group, you must arrange to speak to the group leader (except where noted) by calling (212) 998-4780. Read more...

Counseling Labs       The Counseling Labs (APSY-GE 2658, Individual Counseling Practice I &amp; APSY-GE 2659, Individual Counseling Practice II) are designed to present students with an opportunity for experiential learning and practice in communication skills and counseling process. Based on a training program called Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR), the classes involve the use of training DVDs and audio visual recording of counseling sessions to help students develop self-awareness, personal and professional insight, and basic counseling skills.    Enrollment is open to matriculated NYU graduate students in the following departments:       Applied Psychology;    Drama Therapy;    Dance Therapy;    Speech Pathology.       Be advised that Lab I is a prerequisite for Lab II. Lab I and Lab II are prerequisites for Internship I and Internship II.    Grading for the course is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon circumstances. Those students in Lab I who have not acquired the necessary insight or skill level required for advancement to Lab II will be required to repeat Lab I.    Counseling Lab I Competencies       Mastery of the four basic skill sets introduced in the IPR tapes.    Understanding of and ability to engage in the IPR approach, i.e. client recall, counselor recall, mutual recall and the inquirer role.    Full participation in all lab activities is demonstrated by attendance and involvement in simulated counselor/client interactions, ability to examine skills as a counselor and giving feedback to other in their role plays.    Demonstrate progress through comparison of three marker tapes: beginning, midterm, and end of semester.    Evaluate progress at mid-term and end of semester with lab instructor. Evaluation includes all of the above activities, and for counseling students, indicates readiness to go on to Lab II. An incomplete or failure grade will be given to students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not made adequate progress.    Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab I will be subject to review by the Counseling Program Faculty.       Counseling Lab II Competencies       Ability to utilize the basic skills acquired in Lab I in a counseling situation.    Can conduct a basic counseling intake interview.

Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab II will be subject to review by the Counseling Program Faculty.          The Internship Sequence       Field learning is considered by many to be the center point of any counselor education program. It is strongly believed that counselors-in-training need the opportunity to combine their didactic learning with actual experience in a fieldwork setting where they can observe, develop clinical skills and practice the tasks typically associated with a professional counselor.    This clinical component of the program helps the counselor-in-training acquire an understanding of the role of the professional counselor. The student also develops a sense of professional identity and gains proficiency and confidence by applying his or her overall learning and emerging skills under the supervision of experienced, qualified and approved supervisors. Typically students will spend both semesters in the same internship site. In addition to the required hours in the field students are enrolled in an Internship seminar class. The internship experience is a preparation requirement for certification and /or licensure in all states.    Students in the Program for Mental Health and Wellness are required to meet the state licensure requirement of 600 hours (300 hours per semester or about 20 hours per week) during two consecutive semesters in an appropriate setting approved by the NYU Internship Director, under the supervision of either a licensed mental health professional.          Terminal Experience       The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) is currently the terminal experience for the MA program. The exam should be taken during the student's last semester of matriculation in the program. The fee for taking the CPCE is $45.00. It will be offered once in the fall and twice in the spring. Students have two opportunities to pass the examination. If they are unable to take or pass the exam, they can write an appeal outlining a proposed alternative educational experience to be presented to the M.A.Program Director for approval.          Electives       We define a special population as one in which the psychological development of the individual may be adversely affected by systematic societal factors related to the social class, gender, racial/ethnic status, age, disability, or other social positions.

Counseling Labs       The Counseling Labs (APSY-GE 2658, Individual Counseling Practice I &amp; APSY-GE 2659, Individual Counseling Practice II) are designed to present students with an opportunity for experiential learning and practice in communication skills and counseling process. Based on a training program called Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR), the classes involve the use of training DVDs and audio visual recording of counseling sessions to help students develop self-awareness, personal and professional insight, and basic counseling skills.    Enrollment is open to matriculated NYU graduate students in the following departments:       Applied Psychology;    Drama Therapy;    Dance Therapy;    Speech Pathology.       Be advised that Lab I is a prerequisite for Lab II. Lab I and Lab II are prerequisites for Internship I and Internship II.    Grading for the course is Pass/Incomplete/Fail. Students who miss more than two classes are given an incomplete or failing grade, depending upon circumstances. Those students in Lab I who have not acquired the necessary insight or skill level required for advancement to Lab II will be required to repeat Lab I.    Counseling Lab I Competencies       Mastery of the four basic skill sets introduced in the IPR tapes.    Understanding of and ability to engage in the IPR approach, i.e. client recall, counselor recall, mutual recall and the inquirer role.    Full participation in all lab activities is demonstrated by attendance and involvement in simulated counselor/client interactions, ability to examine skills as a counselor and giving feedback to other in their role plays.    Demonstrate progress through comparison of three marker tapes: beginning, midterm, and end of semester.    Evaluate progress at mid-term and end of semester with lab instructor. Evaluation includes all of the above activities, and for counseling students, indicates readiness to go on to Lab II. An incomplete or failure grade will be given to students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not made adequate progress.    Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab I will be subject to review by the Counseling Program Faculty.       Counseling Lab II Competencies       Ability to utilize the basic skills acquired in Lab I in a counseling situation.    Can conduct a basic counseling intake interview.    Understands the basic counseling process and can integrate skills within this process.

An incomplete or failure grade will be given to students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not made adequate progress.       Any counseling student who receives an incomplete or failure grade in Lab II will be subject to review by the Counseling Program Faculty.          The Internship Sequence       Field learning is considered by many to be the center point of any counselor education program. It is strongly believed that counselors-in-training need the opportunity to combine their didactic learning with actual experience in a fieldwork setting where they can observe, develop clinical skills and practice the tasks typically associated with a professional counselor.    This clinical component of the program helps the counselor-in-training acquire an understanding of the role of the professional counselor. The student also develops a sense of professional identity and gains proficiency and confidence by applying his or her overall learning and emerging skills under the supervision of experienced, qualified and approved supervisors. Typically students will spend both semesters in the same internship site. In addition to the required hours in the field students are enrolled in an Internship seminar class. The internship experience is a preparation requirement for certification and /or licensure in all states.    Students in the Program for Mental Health and Wellness are required to meet the state licensure requirement of 600 hours (300 hours per semester or about 20 hours per week) during two consecutive semesters in an appropriate setting approved by the NYU Internship Director, under the supervision of either a licensed mental health professional.          Terminal Experience       The Counselor Preparation Comprehensive Examination (CPCE) is currently the terminal experience for the MA program. The exam should be taken during the student's last semester of matriculation in the program. The fee for taking the CPCE is $45.00. It will be offered once in the fall and twice in the spring. Students have two opportunities to pass the examination. If they are unable to take or pass the exam, they can write an appeal outlining a proposed alternative educational experience to be presented to the M.A.Program Director for approval.          Electives       We define a special population as one in which the psychological development of the individual may be adversely affected by systematic societal factors related to the social class, gender, racial/ethnic status, age, disability, or other social positions.
