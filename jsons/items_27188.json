Both the major and minor are designed for students seeking pre-professional training for careers in international business and finance, diplomacy, international law, and cultural organizations dealing with Europe. Although open to all students, the minor is especially suited to majors in European languages, history, or the social sciences.    Undergraduates who are matriculated in the College of Arts and Science may also consider the B.A./M.A. program --   an opportunity to earn both the bachelor's degree and the master's   degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the   case.
