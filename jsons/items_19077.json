With a focus on both the business and content aspects of the industry, the program offers students a range of courses with practical and real-life application. Courses deal with the marketing, finance, management, accounting, legal, and economic issues facing entertainment and media firms. Industries covered include, film, home video, television, cable, music, sports, and publishing.        &#8211; Message from the Directors          EMT is a unique program that examines the business side of the entertainment industry. The program has formally been in existence for over 10 years and has grown from a few course offerings in marketing to a wide range of courses in marketing, finance, accounting, economics, law, and management at both the graduate and undergraduate level.    EMT has a broad focus on various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, home video, broadcast TV, cable networks, MSO\u2019s, DTH satellite, publishing (books, newspapers and magazines), sports, and music. Furthermore, the program looks broadly at the different business functions within the industry and how the digital revolution is dramatically challenging and changing existing business models. The MBA and B.S.B.A. curricula blend theory with practical applications. Courses are taught by regular Stern faculty as well as by adjunct professors from leading entertainment firms.    Students gain a broad understanding of the strategy and operating principles that drive the individual sectors of the entertainment industry. Classes are structured to encourage students to explore concepts, frameworks and models, and analyze industry data across multiple revenue streams. Students examine leading companies in the industry, such as Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Sony, CBS, Viacom, and Comcast/NBCU.    In a partnership with the Tisch School of the Arts Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, EMT established a dual MBA/MFA degree. This helps bridge the gap between the \u201ccreatives\u201d and the \u201csuits\" and puts NYU at the forefront of preparing the next generation of producers and studio executives.    EMT attracts truly exceptional students who have a passion for the entertainment industry. Organizations such as STEBA (Stern Tisch Entertainment Business Association) for undergraduates, and MESA (Media Entertainment and Sports Association) and TANG (Technology and New Media Group) for graduate students provide forums for networking and co-curricular activities. One such activity is the ProMotion Pictures Film Competition which brings together business and creative talent from MBAs at Stern and MFAs at Tisch to produce branded entertainment films for major companies. Past sponsors include Cisco, Volvo, Verizon, Unilever\u2019s Axe, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, I LOVE NY, and Vita Coco.    Our New York City location, combined with exceptional students, creates a vibrant and exciting learning environment. The faculty and I are committed to provide the very best educational experience to help launch students on challenging and rewarding careers in the entertainment industry.

With a focus on both the business and content aspects of the industry, the program offers students a range of courses with practical and real-life application. Courses deal with the marketing, finance, management, accounting, legal, and economic issues facing entertainment and media firms. Industries covered include, film, home video, television, cable, music, sports, and publishing.        &#8211; Message from the Directors          EMT is a unique program that examines the business side of the entertainment industry. The program has formally been in existence for over 10 years and has grown from a few course offerings in marketing to a wide range of courses in marketing, finance, accounting, economics, law, and management at both the graduate and undergraduate level.    EMT has a broad focus on various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, home video, broadcast TV, cable networks, MSO\u2019s, DTH satellite, publishing (books, newspapers and magazines), sports, and music. Furthermore, the program looks broadly at the different business functions within the industry and how the digital revolution is dramatically challenging and changing existing business models. The MBA and B.S.B.A. curricula blend theory with practical applications. Courses are taught by regular Stern faculty as well as by adjunct professors from leading entertainment firms.    Students gain a broad understanding of the strategy and operating principles that drive the individual sectors of the entertainment industry. Classes are structured to encourage students to explore concepts, frameworks and models, and analyze industry data across multiple revenue streams. Students examine leading companies in the industry, such as Time Warner, Disney, News Corporation, Sony, CBS, Viacom, and Comcast/NBCU.    In a partnership with the Tisch School of the Arts Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, EMT established a dual MBA/MFA degree. This helps bridge the gap between the \u201ccreatives\u201d and the \u201csuits\" and puts NYU at the forefront of preparing the next generation of producers and studio executives.    EMT attracts truly exceptional students who have a passion for the entertainment industry. Organizations such as STEBA (Stern Tisch Entertainment Business Association) for undergraduates, and MESA (Media Entertainment and Sports Association) and TANG (Technology and New Media Group) for graduate students provide forums for networking and co-curricular activities. One such activity is the ProMotion Pictures Film Competition which brings together business and creative talent from MBAs at Stern and MFAs at Tisch to produce branded entertainment films for major companies. Past sponsors include Cisco, Volvo, Verizon, Unilever\u2019s Axe, Heineken, Johnnie Walker, I LOVE NY, and Vita Coco.    Our New York City location, combined with exceptional students, creates a vibrant and exciting learning environment. The faculty and I are committed to provide the very best educational experience to help launch students on challenging and rewarding careers in the entertainment industry.

Stern web page.            Abstract              This course is a  survey of economic issues in the entertainment and media industries. It  examines some of the special aspects of these businesses that complicate the  market processes, such as the particular nature of demand for experience goods  (interdependent preferences, fads), pricing strategy for providers of  experience goods, scale economies and vertical integration in production, and  obstacles to market equilibrium that motivate public policy. Industries  examined will include :                 * The movie  business: the staged project nature of production, vertical integration,  peculiar contracting mechanisms and the reasons that nearly all films lose  money    * Music and publishing  with an emphasis on intellectual property, both legal and economic issues such  as valuation and royalties, the implications of new digital media;    * Television and radio,  and the fundamental differences between public and private broadcast markets;    * Major league sports,  and the implications of simultaneous production and consumption, labor markets,  and value creation in the sports leagues;    * Art markets, the  creation of and pursuit of economic rents through space and time;    * Gambling, uncertainty,  and certainties of the casino business.              Course Objectives       * We will survey several industries  to provide an overview of the markets for different kinds of experience goods.       * We will use the tools of  microeconomics to provide insights about features and processes that explain  the specific outcomes observed in the markets for experience goods.            Course Requirements       The course grade will be based on four written assignments and a  take home final examination. Class participation is important, especially when  discussing cases and current articles. Also, I hope that your classmates  (and I) can obtain some benefit from knowledge that many of you who have worked  in the entertainment and media industries can share with us.             Grades will be determined on the following basis:            1.   Case: Coming Soon: A Theater Near You  (Due on day 2 )  20%       2.    Written assignment; Entertainment Economics (Due on day 3 ) 20%       3.   Written assignment; DMCA (Due on day 4 )  20%       4.   Written assignment 3 Industry Study (Due on day 6 ) 40%              You may work in small groups (up to three students) on the Theater  case and the written assignments.            During the semester, we will examine three particular cases:       * Coming Soon: A Theater Near You, Harvard Business    School Case 9-797-011  (will be distributed in class)       *  United States  vs. ASCAP (The Capital Cities  Case : This is one of many cases involving music royalties. The March  2, 2007 ruling by the       United States Copyright  Royalty Board is closely related to this case.      *  United   States  vs. Syufy, Judge Kozinski's Opinion, May, 1990       * We will also take a less formal look at Cablevision, a  local vertically integrated firm involved in several related business.              The assignments listed above include:      Case -  Coming Soon, A Theater Near You  :    The theater case is assigned for submission. For your analysis, you will  prepare a 1-2 page writeup on the case. Note, this is to be a short (12  point, double spaced, 1 to 2 page) report, not a major research endeavor.   Also, you may work in groups of up to three individuals and submit a single  paper for the group, if you wish.      ( Download  specific guidelines for this assignment . )          Written  a ssignment  1 - Entertainment Economics:  This assignment will consist of three questions,  answered separately. Each should be answerable in a paragraph or two, and the  entire assignment should not take more than 1.5 pages.      (1) Examples of price discrimination can be found  throughout the entertainment industry. Locate a clear example for a current  type of entertainment. Describe the pricing strategy being used by the  entertainment provider. Discuss the appropriate theoretical foundation for the  pricing strategy.      (2) Locate an example of vertical integration among  contemporary entertainment firms. Describe the firms in question and the nature  of the vertical integration. Can you find counterpart firms in the industry  that provide the same products but are not vertically integrated?      (3) How do Americans spend their entertainment  budgets? Locate some general descriptions of the different ways that Americans  spend money on entertainment. Have the amounts and proportions, or the forms of  entertainment changed in the last 20 years? You may answer this question with  respect to a different country if you prefer.         Written assignment 2 - The DMCA  :    In our 4th class, we will discuss intellectual property. This encompasses  all of the creative arts in the economy including patents on products, devices,  machines and processes, copyrights including, of interest in our class, music  and video productions as well as publishing and a host of other creative  expressions, and trademarks. A central feature in the current business  scrimmage over music and now video copyrights is the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act, or DMCA. This assignment asks you to, first, research the  DMCA, itself, and find out what it is and what its intended role in the economy  is, then, second, write a short paper (one page will suffice) documenting the  role of the DMCA in the case of Viacom vs. YouTube. (Viacom sued YouTube  (Google, its owner) for $1 billion for copyright infringement because users of  YouTube posted vast numbers of clips containing copyrighted material and  YouTube did not do enough to stop them.) An additional question you  should pursue for this assignment - briefly: According to the copyright  law, what is a &quot;public performance (of a piece of music)?&quot; Now,  the large question: Is a &quot;music (or video) download a  performance?&quot; Why would it be? (A useful place to start: Note  the item in the last group of readings for session 4.)          Written assignment 3 - Market Study  :    Due on the final day of class is a short survey of one of the  industries/markets that we will mention in the course, or some other related  industry if you have a particular interest in a segment of the  entertainment/media market that we have not discussed. (You may also go  outside the list of markets we've discussed if you like. In the past, many  students have provided surveys of the markets in which they are employed, for  example, the computer game market.) What I would like here is a 3-4 page description  of the market that you choose. Your writeup should describe the market  structure, the major players, and changes that are taking place. Some other  issues you might consider are: What are the current trends? Is the  market growing or shrinking? How is technological change affecting the  market? Are the major firms in the market merging - is the market  consolidating? How does the market that you have chosen interact with  other markets, both within Entertainment and Media and outside it?                  Codes           Stern Honor:  Of course.              Social:  Your fellow students and your professor will greatly    appreciate it if you will please remember to turn off your cell phone    before the beginning of class.                       Course  Materials                     A very useful reference book for the course is: Entertainment  Industry Economics , Eighth Edition. Hal Vogel,  Cambridge University  Press, 2010 . ( Also  at Barnes and Noble ). Note that Vogel is optional, not required. If you  work in the entertainment industry, or will do so, you should find this a  useful work to have on your shelf. Also, if you have an earlier edition, you  may use it instead.              Vogel is used in other courses at Stern, and should be readily  available at the school bookstore. If not, Amazon and Barnes and Noble can  provide fast, cheap delivery at very advantageous prices. The Vogel book is  widely used around the country and there is no shortage of copies. I am not  assigning any particular reference book for microeconomics, but you may find it  useful to have one. Any of the standard industrial organization oriented books,  for example, the one used in the Firms and Markets course, Managerial Economics  and Business Strategy, 5th edition by Michael R. Baye, McGraw-Hill, 2006,  should suffice.              The &quot;Theater Near You,&quot; case will be distributed in  class. The Cablevision, Syufy and Capital Cities cases are accessible from this  home page in the listings below.         We will discuss Judge Kozinski's decision in   U.S.   vs. Syufy when we  discuss the theater (movie distribution) market. (The judge's opinion in this  case included the titles of over 200 movies (admittedly a bit old now). How  many can you find?)        The Capital Cities case contains a large  amount of legal opinion about basic microeconomics. This case is posted  with the other articles for the course. (See session 4.) A recent ASCAP case,  involving Yahoo!, AOL and Real Networks (April, 2008) grapples with the new  problems created by online distribution of music. ( This  case is posted via the ASCAP website with the references for Session 4.)        We will also rely on several additional articles from the popular press and the  formal economics literature. In some cases, full references will be given  for those who wish to dig deeper into the subject. A large number of  articles are posted below on the course website - some of these are links to  online material. Most of these are optional; I have posted them for those  who are interested in some additional material on the subjects we discuss in  class.
