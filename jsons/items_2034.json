Helen Keller and Emanuel Swedenborg. The role of sense information in forming our knowledge of  the world. Helen Kellers views on Descarte's cogfto: I think, therefore / am. When Helen Keller was asked how she could know so much given her dual handicaps of deafness and blindness, she responded: How can you know anything, given you are continuously misled by your senses?

Many people ask: How complex does a  computational device have to be before it, perhaps like spontaneous combustion, begins to exhibit intelligence, or think? This question implies that the physical substance (the machine) precedes the thinking. Peirce asked: How complex and organized does thought have to be before it, perhaps spontaneously, concludes that there is a physical world, or at least some thoughts can best be organized by assuming they correspond/correlate with something called a physical world? For Peirce, in the beginning was the word.     (a) http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/ling.html      (b)  Brent, The Wasp in the Bottle. In libraries.

Final Exam, Open Book, 60% of Grade.The exam is cumulative and covers all material in the course. Term Projects/Papers are Due on Exam Day         The Fine Print: A student may take the final exam, or produce a computer program in Prolog (no other language) that analyzes some aspect of human language, or write a term paper. The final project can be tumed in as a typewritten term paper or placed on-line as a set of HTML pages. Students may pair up and work together on a single project if it is of awesome proponions. All projects must be approved by the professor by the 22nd class meeting."}]},

There will be two sections, one based on readings and one based on lectures.  Each will contain several questions. You must answer two from section I and two from Section 11. The exam is an OPEN BOOK EXAM. You may bring any materials you wish to the exam: books, computers, printouts, notes, articles, etc. See the sample exams from another class. The exam will cover all reading materials listed above from lecture 1 to 20.      Any and all student term papers, computer projects, or HTML projects must be approved by the professor by the 22nd class.          Helen Keller, Alan Turing, and Charles Sanders Peirce          22. Helen Keller and Emanuel Swedenborg. The role of sense information in forming our knowledge of  the world. Helen Kellers views on Descarte's cogfto: I think, therefore / am. When Helen Keller was asked how she could know so much given her dual handicaps of deafness and blindness, she responded: How can you know anything, given you are continuously misled by your senses?

Many people ask: How complex does a  computational device have to be before it, perhaps like spontaneous combustion, begins to exhibit intelligence, or think? This question implies that the physical substance (the machine) precedes the thinking. Peirce asked: How complex and organized does thought have to be before it, perhaps spontaneously, concludes that there is a physical world, or at least some thoughts can best be organized by assuming they correspond/correlate with something called a physical world? For Peirce, in the beginning was the word.     (a) http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/ling.html      (b)  Brent, The Wasp in the Bottle. In libraries.

Final Exam, Open Book, 60% of Grade.The exam is cumulative and covers all material in the course. Term Projects/Papers are Due on Exam Day         The Fine Print: A student may take the final exam, or produce a computer program in Prolog (no other language) that analyzes some aspect of human language, or write a term paper. The final project can be tumed in as a typewritten term paper or placed on-line as a set of HTML pages. Students may pair up and work together on a single project if it is of awesome proponions. All projects must be approved by the professor by the 22nd class meeting."}, {"content": "Minds and Machines                                Minds and Machines     2014     Silver Center 520     Tuesday and Thursday 3:30-4:45     Professor:  Ned Block    ned.blockat-sign nyu.edu   5 Washington Place, 405   212-998-8322 (Note: you  will have better luck reaching me by email than by phone)   Office Hours: Thursday  5:00-6:00,   and by appointment         TAs: Vera  Flocke Office: 313     Office hours: Friday 10-12 and by  appointment         Martin Abreu  Zavaleta Office: 514     Office hours: Friday 1-3, and by  appointment                                     This course examines the conflict between computational and biological approaches to the mind.

You must choose three of these  assignments, including one of Assignments 1-3, and one assignment after  Assignment 6.         There will be  a final examination, the questions of which will be very similar to questions  on the weekly writing assignments. So you should be satisfied that you  understand the questions even for assignments that you do not do in  writing.         The writing  assignments will normally require statements of positions taken by one of the  authors that you've read. These statements should be couched in your own  words, explaining how you see what the author has said. No quotations; no paraphrases .         Grading: Each  of the three papers will count for one fifth of the grade, the final will  count for one fifth of the grade and participation in class (including  section) will be another one fifth.         Joint work is  encouraged. Arguing about your views with others is the best way to find out  where your position leads. If your paper is a product of joint work, all of  the participants should turn in their own versions, with the communal ideas  stated in each paper in the writer's own words. When you do work together on  an assignment, this must be stated on each paper. All participants in joint  work get full credit.              NO LATE PAPERS . Papers are  due at 5:00 PM on the day indicated. If you  cant get it in by 5 PM, just do the next  assignment.                          ASSIGNMENTS               Remember, no late papers.
