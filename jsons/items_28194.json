Undergraduate life at NYU is made up of a unique combination of experiences that stem from the vast learning opportunities inside and outside the classroom, the rich culture and excitement of New York City, and numerous options for international experiences through the University's global programs. Students will have countless ways to connect with other students in their schools and classrooms, in residence halls, student clubs, and while on the NYU campus.        Unlike its peers, NYU is characterized by its diversity of disciplines. There is no single intellectual experience. The varied programs of study adhere to a common expectation for high achievement, engaging world challenges through diverse academic journeys. Undergraduate courses offered range from chemistry and economics to iPhone programming and Politics &amp; Society in Iran. All courses follow the same high standard of expectation: pursuing the most superior level of academic enterprise and providing diverse, innovative opportunities for learning.            Undergraduate Programs        Undergraduate education at NYU is rooted in a strong liberal arts foundation. The University's undergraduate programs offer distinct options and paths of study, whether you are pursuing a rigorous and extensive education in liberal arts or a liberal arts education with more distinctive professional training.
