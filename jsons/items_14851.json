We define financial intermediaries broadly, including not only commercial banks, but also investment banks and providers of private equity and venture capital. Thus our research program focuses not only on \u2018traditional\u2019 banking questions, such as the regulation of commercial banks and the monetary transmission channels between the banking sector and the real economy, but also on the role and efficiency of investment banks and private equity funds in helping companies raise capital. For instance, the recent fallout from the new-economy boom has led to public and regulatory concerns over the role of investment banks in taking companies public. Other topics the program will focus on include sell-side research coverage, the integration of commercial and investment banking, risk management systems, and the regulatory changes under the Basel II proposals. We plan to organize seminars and conferences, provide access to unique datasets, and publicize the research efforts of NYU faculty in this important field.

NYU's Center for Financial Institutions was established to study their nature and operations.   The center, which co-sponsors the annual Comfort Global Economic Policy Forum , includes perspectives drawn from law, economics, political science, history, and sociology. It encourages scholarly research on central banks, collects and disseminates information relating to their powers and activities, and facilitates discussion among bank officials and scholars in related fields through regular conferences and colloquia.   The director of the center is Stuyvesant P. Comfort Professor of Law Geoffrey Miller .   The Center has been designed to accomplish three major goals:     The collection and dissemination of information related to central banks and financial systems.   The facilitation of discussion among central bankers, scholars, and those in related fields by simplifying the process by which information is gathered and distributed.   The encouragement of scholarly research on central banks and financial systems.
