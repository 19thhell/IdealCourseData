An important announcement was made  Cinema Studies FAQ Prospective Undergraduate Student FAQ Prospective Graduate Student FAQ  What type of program is Cinema Studies? The Department of Cinema Studies offers an academic program dedicated to the study of film history, theory, criticism, and aesthetics. This program is analogous to an English or Comparative Literature program, only here, the focus is on film, broadcasting and other media rather than literature. We offer comprehensive degrees at the B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. levels. We also offer an M.A. in Moving Image Archiving and Preservation, a self-contained curriculum that provides future professionals with an international, comprehensive education in the theories, methods, and practices of moving image archiving and preservation. In addition to film, the program covers video, broadcast television, and digital media. The curriculum combines academic study in the department with professional training at New York City labs, archives, and other repositories. Our undergraduate division is a standard four year program with an emphasis in liberal arts as well as cinema. top What professional opportunities are available to Cinema Studies graduates? Graduates of the M.A. and B.A. enter a variety of fields. The career path choices of our graduates vary tremendously. We have a group of students who have been successful pursuing careers in museum film departments, archives, and programming work. Several of our graduates are employed at such institutions as The Museum of Modern Art, Anthology Film Archives, and The Walker Art Center to name a few. Some of our graduates work in the film industry in development and publicity. Some of our graduates are successful filmmakers, screenwriters, editors, and actors. There are also graduates who have gone on to successful careers in Journalism at periodicals such as the Village Voice , Premiere Magazine , and many others. Our Ph.D. graduates have an excellent record of finding academic positions. Doctoral candidates are often successful in landing teaching positions while they complete their dissertations. As well, some of our Ph.D. graduates occupy positions in leading film museums and archives. top Does the Cinema Studies Program offer any kind of production classes? The Cinema Studies Program offers an academic degree rather than a vocational craft program. A few of our students are interested in supplementing their education with some filmmaking practice. For these students we offer the following options:       As an undergraduate student approaches his/her sophomore level in our program he/she may opt to apply for a double major status with the Department of Undergraduate Film and Television. If accepted, students will receive full access to production courses.    Graduate students wishing to take a production course may opt to take our basic 16mm film production class The Language of Sight and Sound which is open to any of our graduate students each summer.    top How competitive is admission to the program? Admission to all of our programs is very competitive. We generally accept one third of the applications. Each year our admission targets are approximately 40-50 B.A. students, 35-40 M.A. students, 8-12 M.A.(MIAP) students and 4 Ph.D. students. top If I am an applicant to the Ph.D. and do not get accepted and I would be interested in earning an M.A. degree from your program, will I still be considered? Yes, on the graduate application you can stipulate that you would be interested in the M.A. program if not accepted to the Ph.D. If you do enroll in the M.A. program, you will be expected to complete the M.A. before applying to the Ph.D. program. top Is the GRE required to apply to your graduate programs? All applicants to the PHD program must take the GRE. There are no exceptions. Students are encouraged to make arrangements to take the exam well in advance of the application deadline. Contact the GRE board as soon as possible to make arrangements to take the test. Applicants often ask if we have a target score for the GREs - we do not.    As of Fall 2012, we no longer require the GRE as part of the admissions requirements for the M.A. degree. top Does the department have special programs for non-degree students or what about summer classes? Undergraduate students enrolled in other colleges may want to take advantage of our special student status. We allow Undergraduate special students access to most of our undergraduate classes. If you are interested in applying to be a special student at the Tisch School of the Arts in Cinema Studies, please contact the Office of Dean Robert Cameron, Dean of Students of the Tisch School of the Arts at 212-998-1900.    We do not have a non-degree program available to graduate students.    Both graduate and undergraduate students who are not in our department are welcome to enroll in our summer courses. Information regarding summer course offerings is available on Special Programs section of this web site or by calling Tisch Special Programs at 212-998-1500. top If I am accepted as a Cinema Studies student what type of professional and scholarly opportunities are available to me outside of the classroom? The department has numerous opportunities for students outside of our classrooms. As part of your curriculum you may want to take advantage of internships. Many of our students, B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. enroll in an internship. There are many types of internships available. Cinema Studies interns work in museums, archives, film production companies, film distribution offices, periodical offices, televison and radio studios, and other venues. The department lists many positions, as does the Tisch Office of Student Affairs.     Students also take advantage of the many special events the department and the university sponsor. In addition to panel discussions, guest speakers, film series, and readings, the department often hosts major conferences. Some of the topics of these conferences of recent years include The Pan-African Film Conference, The Orson Welles Conference, The Brecht Conference, Hitchcock: A Centennial Celebration and most recently, The Urban Generation Chinese Cinema Conference and the 50th Anniversary of the Cahiers Du Cinema Conference.    Students are also urged to go to the many free screenings here in the department and the university. Our Saturday Cinematheque series continues through the academic year and new films are screened here from both the independent and commercial industries.     New York City is an exceptional place to study film and media. There are several world renowned and outstanding museums with incredible archives and screening programming as well as a host of revival houses within walking distance of campus. top If I have additional questions how can I find out more information? You may also contact the department and speak with the program coordinator, Kenneth Sweeney for information on the M.A. and PHD programs in Cinema Studies or Alicia Kubes for the MIAP program. Both can be reached at 212-998-1600. top Is it possible to come and visit the NYU campus? Students interested in visiting the campus are welcome to do so. University tours are given daily during the academic year. Applicants interested in touring the NYU campus can visit the website for more information. Applicants interested in visiting the department and speaking with an advisor should contact Kenneth Sweeney at 212-998-1600. Keep in mind that departmental visits are informational sessions that are scheduled by appointment and are not admissions interviews. top An important announcement was made about Tisch Asia on November 8, 2012.
