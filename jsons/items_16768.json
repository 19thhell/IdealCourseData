China has again become a major force in the world, while increasingly the world is drawn to China. More than the scope of the conventional Area Studies, the innovative interdisciplinary major in Global China Studies allows students to build on the knowledge and critical skills gained from the core curriculum to deepen their understanding of global currents in China, whether at the level of state and society or of individuals, and in the context of commercial, religious, cultural, political and other interactions. At the same time, students will gain a greater awareness of the extraordinary complexity of what we call \u201cChina\u201d and how that has come about. Global China Studies majors will further their formal language study, either by an additional year of modern Chinese or a year of classical Chinese, or, in consultation with the adviser, by a year\u2019s study of another dialect or language of China. They will learn about digital humanities from the specific perspective of Global China Studies; and finally, are strongly encouraged to study abroad beyond the minimum one semester in order to expand their global experience. Majoring in Global China Studies at NYU Shanghai positions students to pursue graduate education and professional careers in a broad range of areas at the cutting edge of 21st-century experience.
