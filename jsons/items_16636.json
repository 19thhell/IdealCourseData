In    the book by Miller &amp; Michel, the material is in Section    5.6.     18. (Nov 13th) Linear     Stability         I will rely mostly on lecture notes posted here, based in part    on the (optional) book by Fred Brauer and John A. Nohel. In    the book by Miller &amp; Michel, the material is in Sections    5.1-5.5.    16. (Nov 15th) Nonlinear     Stability     In the book by Miller &amp; Michel, the material is in    Sections 6.1-6.2.    19. (Nov 20th) Lyapunov     Functions     Based on Sections 5.1 and 5.2 (optional) book by Fred Brauer    and John A. Nohel.    20. (Nov 27th) Fun with ODEs: Fibonacci sequence     Guest lecture by Prof. Jonathan Goodman     21. (Nov 29th) Introduction to     Numerical solution of ODEs     Guest lecture by Prof. Jonathan Goodman. Here are the Matlab    codes (download them into one directory and then run 'matlab'    and execute command 'ssim', Ctrl+C to stop the animation): fsim.m , ssim.m     22. (Dec 4th) Solving ODEs using Maple     Here is a Maple script (execute 'xmaple ODE_Maple.mw '). Here is a PDF and an html version.     23. (Dec 6th) Solving ODEs using Matlab     And here is a related Matlab script ODE_Matlab.m     which solves the pendulum equation using Euler's method. And    here is the script PredatorPrey.m     to solve the Lotka-Volterra equations from Travis Askham's    recitation.     24. (Dec 11th) Chaotic Dynamics (+review)         25.
