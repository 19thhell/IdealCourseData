Yet, however much music and poetry may have their separate histories and technical languages, poets and composers have continued to probe the relation between the two arts. In this course, we will focus on the relationship between music and poetry in the modern era\u2014from the \u201cfin de si\u00e8cle\u201d and Verlaine\u2019s call to the symbolist poets to compose \u201cMusic above everything,\u201d to the modernists in English and American poetry and the jazz improvisations of the twentieth century. We will study musical and poetic history of the period, grapple with what we mean when we say a poem is musical and what melody means in poetry, and we will study how to define and discuss lyricism in music. Readings may include the work of modern poets (symbolists, imagists, modernists)\u2014Mallarm\u00e9, Verlaine, Val\u00e9ry, Pound, Auden, Mina Loy, Gertrude Stein, Langston Hughes, Stevens \u2014and modern composers Debussy, Stravinsky, Copland, Ives, Thomson and the rhythms of blues and jazz.

When proficient, they play in a viol ensemble. The FAS Music Department lends students a viol and bow from its collection. Qualified students may play with The Teares of the Muses, an ensemble affiliated with the NYU Music Department. The group performs on- and off-campus. Requirements to enroll in the course are previous vocal or instrumental training on any instrument - not limited to strings - and good musicianship skills. * Please note that the class will not actually take place within a structured course time. You will set up appointments for lessons with the professor.    Techniques of Music Composition - MUSIC-GA 2162    Tuesday 12:30-2:30    Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman (section 001)    Instructor: Jaime Oliver (section 002) *Contact the instructor directly for lesson schedules.    Students meet individually with a selected faculty member frequently throughout the semester, to review and discuss their ongoing creative work. All students enrolled in this course must also participate a bi-weekly seminar, led by rotating faculty, that will encompass discussions of technical, aesthetic, and theoretical issues related to 20th/21st century composition. These seminars may also include talks or masterclasses by guests actively involved in the creation or performance of music.   Studies in 20th-Century Analysis - MUSIC-GA 2163    Thursday 10:30-12:30    Instructor: Louis Karchin Focus: Kaija Saariaho and Beat   Furrer. The course will begin with a brief survey of contemporary   analytic techniques, including consideration of reductive analysis   (Schenker, Lerdahl), atonal transformational models (Schoenberg, Forte,   Babbitt), contour theory (Reti, Marvin), semiotic analysis (Nattiez),   and hermeneutic models and processes (Kramer). After this introduction,   the focus will turn to the music of two composers whose works have   emerged as seminal in the 21st century: Kaija Saariaho and Beat Furrer.    Along with their compositions, the course will explore trends of the   latter 20th century that helped shape the aesthetics of these two   composes.   Special Studies: Musical Instruments and Technology - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 001)  Friday 2:00-4:00    Instructor: Emily Dolan \"Neither the bare hand nor the understanding left to itself are of much use. It is by instruments and other aids that the work gets done, and these are needed as much by the understanding as by the hand.\" - Francis Bacon, The Novum Organum (1620) This seminar explores the history of musical instruments and the diverse ways in which we can think about what they are and what they do. Among our themes, we will consider the origins of organology, the relationship between music and technology, the history of mediation, the digital, and instrumental interfaces. We will draw on texts from musicology, ethnomusicology, organology, media studies, sound studies, and the history of science. Instruments, machines, and technology occupy an increasingly central position within musical scholarship, and so we will also ponder this \"instrumental turn,\" that status of instruments as objects of inquiry, and roles they play as boundary objects in various disciplines.  Special Studies: Musical Modernities, Modernisms, and Avant-Gardes - MUSIC-GA 2198 (section 002)  Thursday 2:00-4:00    Instructor: Brigid Cohen This course explores theories and historiographies of modernity, modernism, and the avant-garde, with a special focus on musical literatures, communities, and historical episodes from the 19th century to the present. In doing so, the course provides a critical introduction to the sharp contestations surrounding three interrelated concepts that have long wielded leverage in humanities scholarship. In addition to reading foundational texts that use and define these terms, we will also study contemporary debates that question whether these concepts - rooted in European intellectual histories - have purchase in the study of global comparative contexts. We will also contextualize our study within a network of related, contested key terms, ideas, and conditions: colonialism, capitalism, industrialization, nationality, technology, urbanization, revolution, and community. Theoretical discussions will be enriched by the study of specific artistic communities and settings, including 19th-century Parisian avant-gardes, the Ballets Russes, the Harlem Renaissance, the N \u00e9 gritude movement, the 1930's ethnographic research community in Bali, agitprop theater, and late 20th-century avant-gardes in North America, Europe, and East Asia.  Special Studies: Russian Guitar Poetry and the Aesthetics of Attenuation - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 001)  Tuesday 2:00-4:00    Instructor: J. Martin Daughtry This seminar, which is cross-listed in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies, offers a broad exploration of avtorskaia pesnia (literally \"author's song,\" but often glossed as \"guitar poetry\"), a musical practice that had its first efflorescence in the post-Stalinist Soviet Union and persists in an attenuated form throughout the contemporary Russian-speaking world. The seminar will deal with three broad timespaces: (1) the Soviet Union of the 1970s , when guitar poetry occupied a murky semi-official stance, its social salience was at its peak, and unofficial recordings were circulating wildly throughout the country; (2) Russia of the 1990s , where a new zeitgeist and economic reality forced an attenuation of its social salience, practitioners were forced to enter a commercial market where they were competing with foreign and domestic popular music, and attempts were made to adapt guitar poetry to the demands of Russian nationalism; and (3) the contemporary Russian diaspora , where the genre serves as a form of \"reflective nostalgia\" (Boym 2001); an organizing principle for disparate taste communities; and a modest but viable source of income for touring musicians. Over the course of the semester we will be doing a lot of listening and a fair amount of singing. I will also be bringing a number of practitioners into the classroom, and the class will be invited (though not required) to attend a number of events in the New York area. Russian fluency is not required, but some experience with the Russian language is desirable. (Ideally, students should be able to translate Russian lyrics with the aid of a dictionary).  Special Studies: The Ethics of Musical Marginality in the 20th Century - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 002)  Tuesday 5:00-7:00    Instructor: David Samuels The twentieth century was witness to an ethical discourse about the scope of human that took its cues from a discussion of how human beings should sound, and how people should respond to sound. Specifically, the tones and timbres of vocal and instrumental music acted as a key locus of a dialogue about how one could maintain one's humanity under the conditions of modern urban industrial capital. This course will approach folk revivalism, knowledge of world musics, and practices of early music performance as three emergent and overlapping responses to the perceived dehumanizing processes of the twentieth century. Central to all three are arguments about the human body and shared social participation that place questions of sonorous practice at the center of a conversation about how one expresses one's ethical humanity in the contemporary world, and vice versa.  Special Studies: Ethnographies of Global Popular Music - MUSIC-GA 2199 (section 003)  Monday 4:00-6:00    Instructor: Lauren Ninoshvili How are the musical dimensions of globalization experienced on the ground, in the sorts of geographically bounded areas that have traditionally served as sites of engaged ethnographic inquiry? This course seeks to understand the variety of ways in which globally circulating musical styles impact local aesthetics and repertoires, as an antidote to the kinds of universalizing, \"armchair\" theorizations that have dominated scholarly discourse on music and globalization to date. Key issues to be addressed include cultural imperialism and resistance, ownership and appropriation, purity and hybridity, circulation, liveness and mediation. Focusing on ethnographic monographs published within the last decade, the course sets as a parallel goal a critical reflection on the art and craft of musical ethnography (as both research methodology and writing style) in this era of Internet-mediated cultural experience.
