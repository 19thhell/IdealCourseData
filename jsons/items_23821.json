These language, science, and math requirements are necessary for New York State licensure and ASHA certification . The intent of this standard is to require students to have a broad liberal arts and science background. Specifically, students must:       Complete of three units of a language other than English.    Students must have transcript credit (which could include course work, advanced placement, CLEP, or examination of equivalency) for each of the following areas: human/animal biological science, physical science, social/behavioral science, and statistics. Appropriate course work may include human anatomy and physiology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, genetics, physics, inorganic and organic chemistry, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and statistics. Please note: Courses in biological and physical sciences and research methodology specifically related to communication sciences and disorders may not be applied for certification purposes in this category.       In addition to transcript credit, applicants may be required by their graduate program to provide further evidence of meeting this requirement. These prerequisite courses do not carry graduate credit for the master's degree.    Learning Outcomes    As a graduate of the MS program in Communicative Sciences and Disorders, you will:       Possess prerequisite skills in oral and written communication sufficient for entry into professional practice    Demonstrate knowledge of the principles of biological sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and social/behavioral sciences    Demonstrate knowledge of basic human communication and swallowing processes, including their biological, neurological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, linguistic, and cultural bases    Demonstrate knowledge of the nature of speech, language, hearing, and communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders, including etiologies, characteristics, anatomical /physiological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates    Apply principles and methods of prevention, assessment, and intervention for people with communication and swallowing disorders, including consideration of anatomical/physiological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates of the disorders    Demonstrate knowledge and follow the standards of ethical conduct    Demonstrate knowledge of processes used in research and the integration of research principles into evidence-based clinical practice    Demonstrate knowledge of contemporary professional issues    Demonstrate knowledge about certification, specialty recognition, licensure, and other relevant professional credentials    Complete a supervised practicum that includes experience with individuals across the life span and from culturally/linguistic diverse backgrounds.

These language, science, and math requirements are necessary for New York State licensure and ASHA certification . The intent of this standard is to require students to have a broad liberal arts and science background. Specifically, students must:       Complete of three units of a language other than English.    Students must have transcript credit (which could include course work, advanced placement, CLEP, or examination of equivalency) for each of the following areas: human/animal biological science, physical science, social/behavioral science, and statistics. Appropriate course work may include human anatomy and physiology, neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, genetics, physics, inorganic and organic chemistry, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and statistics. Please note: Courses in biological and physical sciences and research methodology specifically related to communication sciences and disorders may not be applied for certification purposes in this category.       In addition to transcript credit, applicants may be required by their graduate program to provide further evidence of meeting this requirement. These prerequisite courses do not carry graduate credit for the master's degree.    Learning Outcomes    As a graduate of the MS program in Communicative Sciences and Disorders, you will:       Possess prerequisite skills in oral and written communication sufficient for entry into professional practice    Demonstrate knowledge of the principles of biological sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, and social/behavioral sciences    Demonstrate knowledge of basic human communication and swallowing processes, including their biological, neurological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, linguistic, and cultural bases    Demonstrate knowledge of the nature of speech, language, hearing, and communication disorders and differences and swallowing disorders, including etiologies, characteristics, anatomical /physiological, acoustic, psychological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates    Apply principles and methods of prevention, assessment, and intervention for people with communication and swallowing disorders, including consideration of anatomical/physiological, developmental, and linguistic and cultural correlates of the disorders    Demonstrate knowledge and follow the standards of ethical conduct    Demonstrate knowledge of processes used in research and the integration of research principles into evidence-based clinical practice    Demonstrate knowledge of contemporary professional issues    Demonstrate knowledge about certification, specialty recognition, licensure, and other relevant professional credentials    Complete a supervised practicum that includes experience with individuals across the life span and from culturally/linguistic diverse backgrounds.
