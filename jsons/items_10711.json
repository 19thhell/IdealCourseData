Readings in Contemporary Literary Theory ENGL-UA 735 Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every year. 4 points. Topics vary from term to term. Representations of Women ENGL-UA 755 Identical to SCA-UA 734. Prerequisite: Literary Interpretation (ENGL-UA 200). Offered every other year. 4 points. Broadly speaking, feminist theory and studies have been concerned with three central problems or issues: (1) describing the organization of power differences between men and women, (2) explaining the \u201corigins\u201d of sexual and gender difference, and (3) accounting for differences among women (and among men) that complicate notions of sexual and gender difference. This course surveys representations of sexual and gender difference in literary and cultural production, focusing especially on texts authored by women. Students consider theories of gender and sexuality that enable us to consider how literature depicts and engages social relations and, conversely, how our reading practices enact (or transform) social conventions regarding gender difference.

A general introduction to the study of dramatic literature as well as to the very notion of theatre and its place in our cultural life, both past and present. Topics include the emergence of new dramatic genres and forms, the relation between \u201chigh culture\u201d and popular performance, the changing nature and activity of play-going, theories of character and action, the aesthetics of theatre production, the politics of representation, the idea of human and inhuman in performance, the globalization of theatre, and the urbanization of the performing arts, especially in New York. Eight to ten representative plays are read and discussed alongside various writing about the theatre. History of Drama and Theatre I, II DRLIT-UA 110, 111 Identical to ENGL-UA 125, 126.

The first semester covers the major periods of Greek and Roman drama; Japanese classical theatre; medieval drama; theatre of the English, Italian, and Spanish Renaissance; and French neoclassical drama. The second semester begins with English Restoration and 18th-century comedy and continues through romanticism, naturalism, and realism to an examination of antirealism and the major dramatic currents of the 20th century, including postcolonial theatre in Asia, Africa, and Australia.    Advanced Electives in Dramatic Literature    Acting Medieval Literature   DRLIT-UA 35 Identical to MEDI-UA 868. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of \"books\" to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, perform a substantial piece of narrative poetry, sing or play a body of medieval songs, or a similar endeavor.    Naturalism   DRLIT-UA 113 Identical to THEA-UA 705. 4 points.   A study of the origins and development of the most influential dramatic movements of the 20th century. Specific topics vary by term and instructor.    Modern Drama: Expressionism and Beyond   DRLIT-UA 114 Identical to THEA-UA 602. 4 points.   A study of the various formal movements that developed in reaction to realism. After examining several 19th-century antecedents, including Buchner, we study the most important experimental styles of each successive era: symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, epic theatre, the theatre of the absurd, and postmodernism. Authors covered include Maeterlinck, Kaiser, Pirandello, Lorca, Beckett, Genet, Bond, Handke, Muller, and Benmussa. The philosophical context is explored through reading Freud, Marx, Sartre, and Derrida; theoretical readings include essays by Artaud and Brecht. While the class focus is on the many styles that evolved in the 20th-century search for a more expressive form, some attention is given to how this search still very much influences theatre artists today.    Theory of Drama   DRLIT-UA 130 Identical to ENGL-UA 130. 4 points.   Explores the relationship between two kinds of theories: theories of meaning and theories of practice. Among the theories of meaning to be studied are semiotics, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, new historicism, and postmodernism. Theories of practice include naturalism, dadaism, futurism, epic theatre, theatre of cruelty, poor theatre, and environmental theatre. Theories are examined through theoretical essays and representative plays.    Gay and Lesbian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 137 Identical to THEA-UA 624. 4 points.   A survey of contemporary lesbian and gay plays from The Boys in the Band to Angels in America. The goal is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.    Popular Performance   DRLIT-UA 138 Identical to THEA-UA 621. 4 points.   A reevaluation of a wide variety of European and American forms that, beginning in the 16th century, were separated from \"high culture\" theatre. These include fairground performance, commedia dell'arte, mummers' plays, circus, pantomime, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and carnival, puppet, and mask theatre. Exploration of what popular performance does differently than \"high culture\" theatre, how it does so, and to whom it addresses itself. A study of characteristic forms and techniques of popular performance, the connection between Western and non-Western forms, and the central role of popular performance in 20th-century theatre.    Topics in Italian Culture: Futurism in Italy   DRLIT-UA 174 Identical to ITAL-UA 173. 4 points.   Arguably the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century, futurism saw itself as a violent explosion that would drastically redefine not only the artistic landscape but reality as a whole. The futurists produced a theoretical program to overhaul literature, painting, theatre, architecture, music, politics, and even cooking. The approach of the movement's 100th birthday is an opportunity to assess its relevance for our understanding of modernity. This is an interdisciplinary course.    Tragedy   DRLIT-UA 200 Identical to ENGL-UA 720, COLIT-UA 110. 4 points.   Historical and critical study of the idea and practice of tragedy from Greek times to the present.    Greek Drama: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides   DRLIT-UA 210 Identical to CLASS-UA 143. 4 points.   Of the many gifts of the ancient Greeks to Western culture, one of the most celebrated and influential is the art of drama. This course covers, by way of the best available translations, the masterpieces of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, including the place of the plays in the history of the drama and the continuing influence they have had on serious playwrights, including those of the 20th century.    Comedies of Greece and Rome   DRLIT-UA 211 Identical to CLASS-UA 144. 4 points.   Study of early comedy, its form, content, and social and historical background. Covers the Old Comedy of fifth-century Athens through the Attic New Comedy and Roman comedy. Authors include Aristophanes (11 comedies are studied, and one is staged); Euripides, whose tragedies revolutionized the form of both comedy and tragedy; Menander, whose plays were only recently discovered; and Plautus and Terence, whose works profoundly influenced comedy in Western Europe.

Assumes some familiarity with Shakespeare's works. Beginning students should take DRLIT-UA 225, 226. 4 points.   Explores the richness and variety of Shakespearean drama through an emphasis on the mastery of selected major plays. Six to eight plays are read intensively and examined thoroughly in discussion.    Restoration and 18th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 235 4 points.   The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to a 20-year period of civil war and military rule in England. As a postwar culture, Restoration England was a divided society, but also a society ripe for social change and cultural innovation. The London public theatres in this period, reopened after twenty years of prohibition, can be variously characterized as progressive vanguard and conservative rearguard, both an open forum for new ideas and subversive critique of the dominant culture, and a bastion of aristocratic privilege and state hegemony. This course considers the cultural activity of the Restoration public theatres from both outlooks. Embracing the divided nature of the art and culture of this period, the readings are organized into a series of unlikely pairings: urban comedies and classical tragedies, closet dramas and box-office successes, propaganda pieces and broad satires, puritan reform and libertine excess. Playwrights include Dryden, Davenant, Cavendish, Etherege, Wycherley, Rochester, Milton, Centlivre, Shadwell, Otway, and Farquhar.    Feminism and Theatre   DRLIT-UA 240 Identical to THEA-UA 623. 4 points.   A study of plays by female playwrights and feminist theatre from the perspective of contemporary feminist theory. Considerations include strategies for asserting new images of women on stage, the dramatic devices employed by female playwrights, lesbian aesthetics, race, class, and the rejection of realism. Possible plays and performance texts treated include those of Maria Irene Fornes, Caryl Churchill, Sarah Daniels, Wendy Wasserstein, Ntozake Shange, Adrienne Kennedy, Susan Glaspell, Aphra Behn, Alice Childress, Tina Howe, Holly Hughes, Karen Finley, Darrah Cloud, and Suzan-Lori Parks.    Modern British Drama   DRLIT-UA 245 Identical to ENGL-UA 614. 4 points.   Studies in the modern drama of England and Ireland, always focusing on a specific period, a specific group of playwrights, a specific dramatic movement of theatre, or a specific topic. Among playwrights covered at different times are Shaw, Synge, O'Casey, Behan, Osborne, Pinter, Stoppard, Bond, Friel, Storey, Hare, Edgar, Brenton, Gems, Churchill, and Daniels.    Modern American Drama   DRLIT-UA 250 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, SCA-UA 842. 4 points.   Study of the drama and theatre of America since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, the Group Theatre, Thornton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, and David Henry Hwang.    Theatrical Genres   DRLIT-UA 251 Identical to THEA-UA 632. 4 points.   This course (different each time) explores one or more distinctive theatrical genres, such as tragedy, comedy, melodrama, satire, or farce, or plays of distinctive theatrical types, such as theatre of the absurd, the documentary play, or theatre of witness. Since theatrical genres and theatrical types come into being because playwrights respond to historical necessity by visualizing specific worldviews, the course presents a study of the role and function of the theatre within societies, as a response to historical, psychological, and spiritual forces.    Modern U.S. Drama   DRLIT-UA 253 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, THEA-UA 608. 4 points.   A study of drama and theatre in the United States since 1900, including Eugene O'Neill, Susan Glaspell, Sophie Treadwell, Elmer Rice, Clifford Odets and the Group Theatre, Thorton Wilder, Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Edward Albee, Emily Mann, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, Maria Irene Fornes, Adrienne Kennedy, August Wilson, Lorraine Hansberry, David Henry Hwang, David Rabe, Luis Valdez, and Tony Kushner. We explore these writers and their texts as they relate to the page, to the stage, and to U.S. culture at large. We discuss how these writers (and others) represent themselves and notions of \"American-ness\" in their dramatic works. We include important works from the margins, as well as those that represent the mainstream. Does modern U.S. drama lead or follow U.S. culture? Does it tend to be a design for living or a reflection of custom? We also explore the role of gender in culture as demonstrated in these works. Does U.S. drama question the status quo or reinforce it? These and other interrogations inform our readings, discussions, and written assignments.    Major Playwrights   DRLIT-UA 254 Identical to ENGL-UA 652, THEA-UA 618. 4 points.

Issues of race, gender, class; of oppression and empowerment; of marginality and assimilation are explored in the works of such playwrights as Langston Hughes, Alice Childress, Lorraine Hansberry, Amiri Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, Charles Fuller, George C. Wolfe, Ntozake Shange, August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith. The sociohistorical context of each author is also briefly explored. Asian American Theatre   DRLIT-UA 256 Identical to THEA-UA 606. 4 points.   Acts as both an introduction to the genre of Asian American theatre and an interrogation into how this genre has been constituted. Through a combination of play analysis and historical discussion\u2014starting with Frank Chen's The Chickencoop Chinaman, the first Asian American play produced in a mainstream venue\u2014the class looks at the ways Asian American drama and performance intersect with a burgeoning Asian American consciousness. We review the construction of Asian American history through such plays as Genny Lim's Paper Angels and more recent works such as Chay Yew's A Language of Their Own. We also read theoretical and historical texts that provide the basis for a critical examination of the issues surrounding Asian American theatre. Orientalism, media representation, and theories of genealogy inform our discussion.    Political Theatre   DRLIT-UA 258 Identical to THEA-UA 622. 4 points.   Major forms, plays, and theories of socially engaged theatre exemplifying performance as a site of resistance, social critique, and utopianism.

Comparative Study: 20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 261 4 points.   The two decades or so following World War II were a particularly exciting period in the history of drama in Europe and America. This course focuses on five playwrights\u2014Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Adrienne Kennedy, and Peter Weiss\u2014whose engagements with postwar history and politics shaped the form and content of their works for the stage. Questions include modes of representing historical experience, theatre and historical forms of spectatorship, and challenges to genre. The presumption is that we cannot know in advance what it means to describe a play as \"political.\" Readings include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and selected shorter plays; Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Orpheus Descending; Genet's The Balcony, The Blacks, and The Screens; Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, The Owl Answers, and A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White; and Weiss's Marat/Sade and The Investigation.    17th-Century Theatre   DRLIT-UA 290 4 points.

These are plays about world-conquering heroes, murderous conspirators, riotous good-fellows, and star-crossed lovers; they are also about the fast-changing culture of early modern England, dealing with new patterns of urban life, emergent notions of republican politics and personal liberty, the discovery of new worlds and new sciences, and the increasing pressures of European war, revolution, and civil war. A different play each week. Plays by Beaumont, Brome, Dekker, Fletcher, Ford, Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Middleton, Milton, Shirley, and Webster.    Theatre of Latin America   DRLIT-UA 293 Identical to THEA-UA 748. 4 points.   An introduction to the history, theories, and practices of Latin American drama, focusing on the 20th century. We pay special attention to the historical reinvention of European-based theatrical forms in the Americas through their continuous interaction with non-European cultural forms. Through the plays of leading dramatists\u2014including Jorge Diaz, Egon Wolff, and Sergio Vodanovic (Chile); Jose Triana (Cuba); Rene Marquez and Luis Rafael Sanchez (Puerto Rico); Isaac Chocron (Venezuela); Emilio Carballido, Luisa Josefina Hernandez, Sabina Berman, and Elena Garro (Mexico); and Osvaldo Dragun, Eduardo Pavlovsky, Roberto Cossa, and Griselda Gambaro (Argentina)\u2014we explore the significance of modernist and postmodernist dramatic forms in cultures where industrial modernity is an insecure social context. We study the wealth of oppositional theatre in Latin America\u2014exemplified by Augusto Boal's \"theatre of the oppressed\"\u2014in relation to the historical use (or abuse) of theatrical spectacle as a political means to control peoples, from the early Spanish conquerors to recent authoritarian state leaders. We read postcolonial Latin American theories of culture and art, such as hybridity, transculturation, Brazil's modernist and anticolonial antropofagia, and the \"aesthetics of hunger,\" drawing on the work of Fernando Ortiz, Angel Rama, and Nestor Garcia Canclini, among others. We consider \"magical realism\" in the theatre as a social poetics of scarcity.    Theatre in Asia   DRLIT-UA 294 Identical to THEA-UA 744. 4 points.   This course (different each time) examines different traditions, innovations, representations, and locations of Asian theatre.

Types of performance studied include dadaist, surrealist, and futurist plays; multimedia happenings of Karpov, Oldenberg, and Whitman; conceptual self-works and solos of performers such as Vito Acconci, Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, and Diamanda Galas; and the work of avant-gardists such as Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, Meredith Monk, Ping Chong, Mabou Mines, LeCompte's Wooster Group, and Pina Bausch. Readings are supplemented by slides, videotape, and attendance at suggested performance events.    Drama in Performance   DRLIT-UA 300 Identical to ENGL-UA 132. 4 points.

Contemporary European Theatre   DRLIT-UA 609 4 points.   The European theatre scene of the last two decades has witnessed the emergence of a new wave of dramatists who share a dark, desperate, depressive, yet humorous Weltanschauung and style. They have encountered controversy and shock in reception but could not be ignored, gradually gaining a significant place in recent theatre history. We study and discuss work by Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, David Harrower, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Koffi Kwahule, Yasmina Reza, Juan Mayorga, Biljana Srbljanovi, Gianina Carbunariu, Hristo Boytchev, Matei Visniec, Goran Stefanovski, Vassily Sigarev, and their forerunners Beckett, Ionesco, Orton, Churchill, Koltes, Havel, Mrozek, et al.    Irish Dramatists   DRLIT-UA 700 Identical to THEA-UA 603, IRISH-UA 700. 4 points.

Playwrights covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin. Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements, and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic work.    Gender and Performance in the Italian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 720 Identical to ITAL-UA 720. 4 points.   Examines plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and historiography of the early modern period (1350-1700). Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell'arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well as the \"revisions\" that women playwrights and writers made to a largely male-dominated canon.    20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 730 4 points.   Transportable Drama: Stock character types, dramatic figures, and archetypal plots are to a certain extent independent and transportable terms that appear and reappear in multiple play texts, versions of those texts, and in diverse media. Beyond that, the experience of what we call \"drama\" is not limited to play texts and their presentation; it is present in fiction, news, film, television, the visual and electronic arts, and advertising. In this course, we explore how the dramatic impulse of several plots, figures, and characters is expressed in play texts and other media across several historical periods. For example, we may choose to look at Zola's novel and play of Therese Raquin, followed by Marcel Carne's 20th-century film adaptation. Or, we might examine one or more of the historical Don Juan plays in combination with the Byron poem, the Mozart opera, and/or a modern film treatment. Similarly, Shakespearean texts have been widely adapted to the present day, not only in theatrical spin-offs and films, but also through renderings by visual artists. A play based upon a news event, such as Treadwell's Machinal, may be examined in light of the original reportage and public records. By looking at clusters of related works in tandem, rather than as freestanding objects of study, we will gain a greater understanding of drama as a transportable art form and of adaptation in both its practical and theoretical aspects.

This course (different every time) introduces students to the specific choices that a director must make to transform the \"printed word\" into a visual auditory experience. For example, point of view becomes a challenge of camera shots; a described room becomes a matter of lighting, color, and sound; and the sense of time becomes a product of editing, rhythm, music, and splicing. Throughout the course, we pit a director's view against an author's view to examine how the same story may express different agendas, depending on the rendering. Works may include Euripides' Medea (Pasolini), Nabokov's Lolita (Kubrick), Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver (Scorsese), Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Potter), and Thomas Hardy's Tess (Polanski).

Honors Seminar    The subject of the Honors Seminar changes each year and is decided on by the faculty member teaching the seminar. The seminar is a small class (limited to 12) that ideally prepares students for the senior thesis; the primary focus is on research and the application of critical methodologies.

Drama studies majors normally take this seminar to complete the seminar requirement. (English majors in honors may also take this designated seminar if they choose to, subject to the 12-student limit.) Dramatic literature majors in honors may also satisfy the seminar requirement by taking, with the instructor's permission, the Honors Seminar in the undergraduate Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts.    Admission to the Drama Studies honors program is competitive. The Honors Seminars are limited to 12 students. The minimum GPA for admission to any College of Arts and Science honors program is 3.65 or better (both overall and in the major). In addition, students must have completed the two core courses History of Drama and Theatre I and II (DRLIT-UA 110 and 111) by the end of the semester in which they apply for the honors track.

Advanced Electives in Dramatic Literature    Acting Medieval Literature   DRLIT-UA 35 Identical to MEDI-UA 868. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of \"books\" to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, perform a substantial piece of narrative poetry, sing or play a body of medieval songs, or a similar endeavor.

After examining several 19th-century antecedents, including Buchner, we study the most important experimental styles of each successive era: symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, epic theatre, the theatre of the absurd, and postmodernism. Authors covered include Maeterlinck, Kaiser, Pirandello, Lorca, Beckett, Genet, Bond, Handke, Muller, and Benmussa. The philosophical context is explored through reading Freud, Marx, Sartre, and Derrida; theoretical readings include essays by Artaud and Brecht. While the class focus is on the many styles that evolved in the 20th-century search for a more expressive form, some attention is given to how this search still very much influences theatre artists today.    Theory of Drama   DRLIT-UA 130 Identical to ENGL-UA 130. 4 points.   Explores the relationship between two kinds of theories: theories of meaning and theories of practice. Among the theories of meaning to be studied are semiotics, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, new historicism, and postmodernism. Theories of practice include naturalism, dadaism, futurism, epic theatre, theatre of cruelty, poor theatre, and environmental theatre. Theories are examined through theoretical essays and representative plays.    Gay and Lesbian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 137 Identical to THEA-UA 624. 4 points.   A survey of contemporary lesbian and gay plays from The Boys in the Band to Angels in America. The goal is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.    Popular Performance   DRLIT-UA 138 Identical to THEA-UA 621. 4 points.   A reevaluation of a wide variety of European and American forms that, beginning in the 16th century, were separated from \"high culture\" theatre. These include fairground performance, commedia dell'arte, mummers' plays, circus, pantomime, minstrel shows, vaudeville, and carnival, puppet, and mask theatre. Exploration of what popular performance does differently than \"high culture\" theatre, how it does so, and to whom it addresses itself.

Topics in Italian Culture: Futurism in Italy   DRLIT-UA 174 Identical to ITAL-UA 173. 4 points.   Arguably the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century, futurism saw itself as a violent explosion that would drastically redefine not only the artistic landscape but reality as a whole. The futurists produced a theoretical program to overhaul literature, painting, theatre, architecture, music, politics, and even cooking. The approach of the movement's 100th birthday is an opportunity to assess its relevance for our understanding of modernity. This is an interdisciplinary course.    Tragedy   DRLIT-UA 200 Identical to ENGL-UA 720, COLIT-UA 110. 4 points.   Historical and critical study of the idea and practice of tragedy from Greek times to the present.    Greek Drama: Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides   DRLIT-UA 210 Identical to CLASS-UA 143. 4 points.   Of the many gifts of the ancient Greeks to Western culture, one of the most celebrated and influential is the art of drama.

Explores the richness and variety of Shakespearean drama through an emphasis on the mastery of selected major plays. Six to eight plays are read intensively and examined thoroughly in discussion.    Restoration and 18th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 235 4 points.   The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to a 20-year period of civil war and military rule in England. As a postwar culture, Restoration England was a divided society, but also a society ripe for social change and cultural innovation. The London public theatres in this period, reopened after twenty years of prohibition, can be variously characterized as progressive vanguard and conservative rearguard, both an open forum for new ideas and subversive critique of the dominant culture, and a bastion of aristocratic privilege and state hegemony. This course considers the cultural activity of the Restoration public theatres from both outlooks. Embracing the divided nature of the art and culture of this period, the readings are organized into a series of unlikely pairings: urban comedies and classical tragedies, closet dramas and box-office successes, propaganda pieces and broad satires, puritan reform and libertine excess. Playwrights include Dryden, Davenant, Cavendish, Etherege, Wycherley, Rochester, Milton, Centlivre, Shadwell, Otway, and Farquhar.

This course (different each time) explores one or more distinctive theatrical genres, such as tragedy, comedy, melodrama, satire, or farce, or plays of distinctive theatrical types, such as theatre of the absurd, the documentary play, or theatre of witness. Since theatrical genres and theatrical types come into being because playwrights respond to historical necessity by visualizing specific worldviews, the course presents a study of the role and function of the theatre within societies, as a response to historical, psychological, and spiritual forces.    Modern U.S. Drama   DRLIT-UA 253 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, THEA-UA 608. 4 points.

We explore these writers and their texts as they relate to the page, to the stage, and to U.S. culture at large. We discuss how these writers (and others) represent themselves and notions of \"American-ness\" in their dramatic works. We include important works from the margins, as well as those that represent the mainstream. Does modern U.S. drama lead or follow U.S. culture? Does it tend to be a design for living or a reflection of custom? We also explore the role of gender in culture as demonstrated in these works. Does U.S. drama question the status quo or reinforce it? These and other interrogations inform our readings, discussions, and written assignments.    Major Playwrights   DRLIT-UA 254 Identical to ENGL-UA 652, THEA-UA 618. 4 points.

Issues of race, gender, class; of oppression and empowerment; of marginality and assimilation are explored in the works of such playwrights as Langston Hughes, Alice Childress, Lorraine Hansberry, Amiri Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, Charles Fuller, George C. Wolfe, Ntozake Shange, August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith. The sociohistorical context of each author is also briefly explored. Asian American Theatre   DRLIT-UA 256 Identical to THEA-UA 606. 4 points.   Acts as both an introduction to the genre of Asian American theatre and an interrogation into how this genre has been constituted. Through a combination of play analysis and historical discussion\u2014starting with Frank Chen's The Chickencoop Chinaman, the first Asian American play produced in a mainstream venue\u2014the class looks at the ways Asian American drama and performance intersect with a burgeoning Asian American consciousness. We review the construction of Asian American history through such plays as Genny Lim's Paper Angels and more recent works such as Chay Yew's A Language of Their Own. We also read theoretical and historical texts that provide the basis for a critical examination of the issues surrounding Asian American theatre. Orientalism, media representation, and theories of genealogy inform our discussion.    Political Theatre   DRLIT-UA 258 Identical to THEA-UA 622. 4 points.   Major forms, plays, and theories of socially engaged theatre exemplifying performance as a site of resistance, social critique, and utopianism.

Comparative Study: 20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 261 4 points.   The two decades or so following World War II were a particularly exciting period in the history of drama in Europe and America. This course focuses on five playwrights\u2014Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Adrienne Kennedy, and Peter Weiss\u2014whose engagements with postwar history and politics shaped the form and content of their works for the stage. Questions include modes of representing historical experience, theatre and historical forms of spectatorship, and challenges to genre. The presumption is that we cannot know in advance what it means to describe a play as \"political.\" Readings include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and selected shorter plays; Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Orpheus Descending; Genet's The Balcony, The Blacks, and The Screens; Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, The Owl Answers, and A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White; and Weiss's Marat/Sade and The Investigation.    17th-Century Theatre   DRLIT-UA 290 4 points.   Explores plays written by Shakespeare's collaborators, rivals, and followers\u2014English drama in the age of Shakespeare written by playwrights other than Shakespeare. These are plays about world-conquering heroes, murderous conspirators, riotous good-fellows, and star-crossed lovers; they are also about the fast-changing culture of early modern England, dealing with new patterns of urban life, emergent notions of republican politics and personal liberty, the discovery of new worlds and new sciences, and the increasing pressures of European war, revolution, and civil war. A different play each week. Plays by Beaumont, Brome, Dekker, Fletcher, Ford, Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Middleton, Milton, Shirley, and Webster.    Theatre of Latin America   DRLIT-UA 293 Identical to THEA-UA 748. 4 points.   An introduction to the history, theories, and practices of Latin American drama, focusing on the 20th century. We pay special attention to the historical reinvention of European-based theatrical forms in the Americas through their continuous interaction with non-European cultural forms.

We study the wealth of oppositional theatre in Latin America\u2014exemplified by Augusto Boal's \"theatre of the oppressed\"\u2014in relation to the historical use (or abuse) of theatrical spectacle as a political means to control peoples, from the early Spanish conquerors to recent authoritarian state leaders. We read postcolonial Latin American theories of culture and art, such as hybridity, transculturation, Brazil's modernist and anticolonial antropofagia, and the \"aesthetics of hunger,\" drawing on the work of Fernando Ortiz, Angel Rama, and Nestor Garcia Canclini, among others. We consider \"magical realism\" in the theatre as a social poetics of scarcity.    Theatre in Asia   DRLIT-UA 294 Identical to THEA-UA 744. 4 points.

Emphasis is placed on theatrical forms that have been influenced by the theories of Artaud and the European avant-garde; John Cage and visual aesthetics related to American acting, painting, collage, and environmental and conceptual art. Types of performance studied include dadaist, surrealist, and futurist plays; multimedia happenings of Karpov, Oldenberg, and Whitman; conceptual self-works and solos of performers such as Vito Acconci, Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, and Diamanda Galas; and the work of avant-gardists such as Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, Meredith Monk, Ping Chong, Mabou Mines, LeCompte's Wooster Group, and Pina Bausch. Readings are supplemented by slides, videotape, and attendance at suggested performance events.    Drama in Performance   DRLIT-UA 300 Identical to ENGL-UA 132. 4 points.

Contemporary European Theatre   DRLIT-UA 609 4 points.   The European theatre scene of the last two decades has witnessed the emergence of a new wave of dramatists who share a dark, desperate, depressive, yet humorous Weltanschauung and style. They have encountered controversy and shock in reception but could not be ignored, gradually gaining a significant place in recent theatre history. We study and discuss work by Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, David Harrower, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Koffi Kwahule, Yasmina Reza, Juan Mayorga, Biljana Srbljanovi, Gianina Carbunariu, Hristo Boytchev, Matei Visniec, Goran Stefanovski, Vassily Sigarev, and their forerunners Beckett, Ionesco, Orton, Churchill, Koltes, Havel, Mrozek, et al.    Irish Dramatists   DRLIT-UA 700 Identical to THEA-UA 603, IRISH-UA 700. 4 points.

Playwrights covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin. Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements, and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic work.    Gender and Performance in the Italian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 720 Identical to ITAL-UA 720. 4 points.   Examines plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and historiography of the early modern period (1350-1700). Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell'arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well as the \"revisions\" that women playwrights and writers made to a largely male-dominated canon.    20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 730 4 points.   Transportable Drama: Stock character types, dramatic figures, and archetypal plots are to a certain extent independent and transportable terms that appear and reappear in multiple play texts, versions of those texts, and in diverse media. Beyond that, the experience of what we call \"drama\" is not limited to play texts and their presentation; it is present in fiction, news, film, television, the visual and electronic arts, and advertising. In this course, we explore how the dramatic impulse of several plots, figures, and characters is expressed in play texts and other media across several historical periods. For example, we may choose to look at Zola's novel and play of Therese Raquin, followed by Marcel Carne's 20th-century film adaptation. Or, we might examine one or more of the historical Don Juan plays in combination with the Byron poem, the Mozart opera, and/or a modern film treatment. Similarly, Shakespearean texts have been widely adapted to the present day, not only in theatrical spin-offs and films, but also through renderings by visual artists. A play based upon a news event, such as Treadwell's Machinal, may be examined in light of the original reportage and public records. By looking at clusters of related works in tandem, rather than as freestanding objects of study, we will gain a greater understanding of drama as a transportable art form and of adaptation in both its practical and theoretical aspects.

This course (different every time) introduces students to the specific choices that a director must make to transform the \"printed word\" into a visual auditory experience. For example, point of view becomes a challenge of camera shots; a described room becomes a matter of lighting, color, and sound; and the sense of time becomes a product of editing, rhythm, music, and splicing. Throughout the course, we pit a director's view against an author's view to examine how the same story may express different agendas, depending on the rendering. Works may include Euripides' Medea (Pasolini), Nabokov's Lolita (Kubrick), Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver (Scorsese), Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Potter), and Thomas Hardy's Tess (Polanski).

The intern's duties on-site should involve some substantive aspect of work in drama. The student is expected to fulfill the obligation of the internship itself, and a written evaluation is solicited from the outside sponsor at the end. The grade for the course is based on a final project submitted to a faculty director with whom the student has been meeting regularly over the semester to discuss the progress of the internship.    Independent Study   DRLIT-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies. May not duplicate the content of a regularly offered course. Intended for qualified upper-class majors or minors in this department, but may not be used to fulfill the minimum requirements of either the major or the minor. 2 or 4 points per term.   Requires a paper of considerable length that should embody the results of a semester's reading, thinking, and frequent conferences with the student's director. The paper should show the student's ability to investigate, collect, and evaluate his or her material, finally drawing conclusions that are discussed in a sound and well-written argument. In the 2-point course, the student is held to the same high standard as is the student who is working for 4 points, but the investigation and the paper are of proportionate length.    Honors Seminar    The subject of the Honors Seminar changes each year and is decided on by the faculty member teaching the seminar. The seminar is a small class (limited to 12) that ideally prepares students for the senior thesis; the primary focus is on research and the application of critical methodologies. Each year, one of the Department of English Junior Honors Seminars is also designated as the drama studies Honors Seminar, with at least a partial focus on drama. Drama studies majors normally take this seminar to complete the seminar requirement. (English majors in honors may also take this designated seminar if they choose to, subject to the 12-student limit.) Dramatic literature majors in honors may also satisfy the seminar requirement by taking, with the instructor's permission, the Honors Seminar in the undergraduate Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts.    Admission to the Drama Studies honors program is competitive. The Honors Seminars are limited to 12 students. The minimum GPA for admission to any College of Arts and Science honors program is 3.65 or better (both overall and in the major). In addition, students must have completed the two core courses History of Drama and Theatre I and II (DRLIT-UA 110 and 111) by the end of the semester in which they apply for the honors track.

MCC-GE 2005 - Psychic Life of Media   \"Our writing tools are also working on our thoughts,\" Nietzsche supposedly declared &agrave; propos his typewriter. This claim has been used by Friedrich Kittler and others to argue for a version of media studies based on \"media-technological determinism.\" This course will consider how various Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalytic concepts might be used to critique this position, or at least provide it with greater nuance . Readings vary from semester to semester. Sample Syllabus          MCC-GE 2010 - Censorship in American Culture   This course examines censorship in American culture, from the late 19th century to the present and surveys areas where debates about censorship have been urgently contested, from discussions about birth control, to literature, film, theatre, art galleries and history museums, to sidewalks and lecture halls, to the internet. Students will explore the historical contexts in which important cultural and legal struggles over censorship took place and how this history affects contemporary debates about the arts, sexuality, national security, technology, privacy, and government involvement in the marketplace of ideas and images.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2025 - Race and Media   The racial and ethnic diversity of the United States from Europeans' first encounter with Native Americans, through colonialism and American slavery, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights era and beyond has made the issue of race one of the United States' principal sites of conflict and conversation. For many years, scholarship on race and media has focused on a myriad of theories and issues surrounding representation, concerned with the presence or lack of people of color in media of all kinds, and the stereotypical ways they are portrayed when they are present. But this is only one part of the story. While this course highlights many of these issues, it focuses on the ways that media can and have shaped public discourse about race and racism both within and beyond the confines of the United States. The course considers a variety of media television sitcoms and drama, television and print news, film, popular music, the internet and others for the purpose of investigating how media have and continue to variably influence the publics racial agenda, and the general content, tone and tenor of racial conversation in the public sphere.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2027 - Media and the Environment   This course will introduce you to the varied ways in which human and natural environments have been shaped by media representations and technologies, extending from newspapers, photography, and popular literature, to film, television, and video games. The course integrates the study of environmental media from diverse disciplinary perspectives, including eco-cinema, eco-criticism, environmental communication, and environmental studies. It surveys research from media studies that explores how environments are represented in visual media; from eco-critical texts that detail the specificities of poetic, literary, and artistic approaches to the environment; and work in environmental communication that documents the role of the mass media, including the Internet, broadcast television, and news programs, in the dissemination of environmental messages. The course will also interrogate the diverging functions of environmental media in different historical periods and social contexts, beginning with the rise of landscape photography, scientific representations of nature, and &ldquo;fictional&rdquo; wildlife films; extending through the development of canonical environmental media works in the 1960s; and ending with the role of contemporary interactive and &ldquo;recycling&rdquo; based aesthetics. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2030 - Architecture as Media   This class reads architecture and the built environment through the lenses of media, communication, and culture. The course takes seriously the proposition that spaces communicate meaningfully and that learning to read spatial productions leads to better understanding how material and technological designs are in sustained conversation with the social, over time. Through analyses of a range of spaces &ndash; from Gothic Cathedrals to suburban shopping malls to homes, factories, skyscrapers and digital cities &ndash; students will acquire a vocabulary for relating representations and practices, symbols and structures, and for identifying the ideological and aesthetic positions that produce settings for everyday life.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2100 - Seminar in Media Criticism   Analysis of the media environment from a variety of critical perspectives. Emphasis on writing as well as reading media criticism.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2112 - Politics of the Gaze   The mediation and technological development of vision and its dominance over the human sensorium is integral to the emergence of the modern, including experiences of urbanism, consumer desire, gender/sexual identities, race and ethnicity, trans-cultural image systems, aesthetic production, and the making of power and political truth claims. This seminar will focus on introducing participants to the core theories and analytic methods of visual culture, and the socio-political history of the human sensorium in a variety of disciplines, including ethnography, social history, urban studies, cinema studies, social geography, material culture studies, and media studies.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2125 - Evolution of Technology    Traces the development of technology from historical, current, &amp; future-oriented perspectives. Attention given to intended &amp; unintended consequences of technological events.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2134 - Media Archaeology   Over the last decade or so, scholars in several disciplines have embarked on a series of media-archaeological excavations, sifting through the layers of early and obsolete practices and technologies of communication. The archaeological metaphor evokes both the desire to recover material traces of the past and the imperative tosituate those traces in their social, cultural, and political contexts - while always watching our steps. This eminar will examine some of the most important contributions to the field of media archaeology and, most importantly, provide an ongoing research studio in which participants undertake archaeological projects of their own.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2135 - Media, Memory, and History     This seminar will focus on introducing participants to the basic theory and core methods of visual culture studies in a variety of disciplines, including ethnography, social history, urban studies, cinema studies, social geography, art history and media studies.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2136 - War and Media Theory   Communication studies traditionally focus on how war is propagandized by mass media. In contrast, this seminar proposes that war is an encompassing mode of political communication in which media is militarized and violence is mediatized. We will examine how modern warfare has generated new visual cultures and new media networks. This seminar proposes that the visual technology of war and the technologies of event dissemination are linked problems in the political history of representation. The triangulation of person, place and time as the basis of perceiving history can only be accounted for by a history of mediated perception-a history increasingly characterized by military technologies and military visual culture, and their fashioning of the modern sensorium. The seminar will examine the thesis that the 'informationatization' of contemporary consciousness can only be understood through a media theory of war.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2137 - Memory, Architecture and Design: Comparative Perspectiveson New York and Buenos Aires   This course compares the debates &amp; contestations over architecture&rsquo;srelationship to memory, trauma, nationalism, &amp; memorialization thathave taken place in Argentina, over the memory of its &ldquo;dirty war&rdquo; from1976-1983, and in the United States over the last three decades. Itsituates this comparative perspective within the scholarship ofarchitecture &amp; design, memory studies, &amp; visual culture.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2138 - Politics of Digital Media       This  seminar will examine the myriad ways in which digital media shape our political  and cultural institutions, processes, and perceptions. From the silver-haired  architect of Wikileaks to the networked activists who helped bring down a slew  of Arab regimes, digital media are facilitating previously unimaginable  contests for visibility and power, ushering in a shift from spectatorship to  participation. But they are neither uncomplicated nor monolithic: A host of  forces, from government legislation to market considerations, are vying to  fashion the emerging technologies into weapons used to oppress opponents and  stifle dissent. To paint this rapidly evolving landscape, we will look at broad  political theories as well as particular policies, will hear from leading  theorists and activists in the field, and will strive to emerge with both a  philosophical and practical understanding of the movements currently at work  and the technological platform on which they rely and against which they  sometimes feud.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2143 - Cultural Analysis of Design   This class introduces design as an intersection of practice, philosophy, aesthetics, politics, and material culture. In the course of bringing students into the contemporary conversation that organizes design discourse increasingly in terms of interaction, this class prepares students to conduct original project work on the history, culture, and aesthetics of contemporary material and visual culture at the scale of computers, media, architecture, and product.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2146 - The Sitcom    This course examines the history and politics of television's most enduring genre, the situation comedy. The sitcom occupies a particularly important place in U.S. cultural hierarchies. Both lauded as an innovative, quintessentially televisual form and denigrated as the epitome of mass media's formulaic cultural dross, the genre is a discursive locus in which U.S. preoccupations with class, race, gender, and other forms of difference are negotiated.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2147 - Reality and Documentary TV   This course will survey  the historical development and shifting definitions of documentary and reality  television. We will explore the ways in which television has understood and  utilized non-fiction formats at particular historical moments; trace the  formations and deployment of realist aesthetics; explore the ethical  obligations/problematics of these forms and their practitioners; examine the  implications and meanings of documentary/reality hybrids; and consider the reception  of and cultural meanings derived from particular documentary and reality texts  and subgenres. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2149 - A Cultural History of Television   A survey of the cultural and industrial history of American television; focus on how technological innovation, regulatory bodies, advertisers, network heads, creative producers, audiences have interacted with economic, social, and political forces to shape television over time. Examines the methodological practices and concerns involved in the writing of media histories and specifically the history of broadcasting. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2150 - The Origins of Modern Media    sample syllabus Examination of the sociopolitical, technological, aesthetic, &amp; institutional development of media from 1880-1950. Emphasis is placed on telegraphy, telephony, sound-recording, &amp; amplification devices, radio (both point-to-point &amp; broadcast) &amp; film. Students are introduced to a variety of historiographical techniques &amp; are encouraged to reflect upon the relationship between origins of the mass media &amp; current technological institutional, sociopolitical &amp; aesthetic dynamics of media.          MCC-GE 2155 - Activist Art and Creative Activism   The course will focus on the tactical, strategic, and organizational uses of artistic aesthetic taken up by the activist for the purpose of social change. The course will rely on both a survey of the existing theory and scholarship on &ldquo;artistic activism,&rdquo; as well as close analyses of contemporary practices on a local, national and global scale. Special attention will be paid to issues of creativity and efficacy, addressing questions concerning the value of this hybrid practice as both an aesthetic and political activity.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-GE 2157 - The Communications Revolution and Culture in America    An examination of the nature of the communications revolution in the 20th century &amp; its impact on American cultural life &amp; institutions. First semester focuses on the political economy of media from a critical perspective; second semester focuses on current developments in the communications industry &amp; their impact on the U.S. &amp;global culture, from an industry perspective. Either half may be taken independently.          MCC-GE 2166 - The Global City and Media Ethnography: Practice-led Transcultural Media Research   The course focuses on the theories and methods of media/sensory ethnography, visual culture, media archeology, through the linked topics of transcultural and trans-local processes, diaspora identities, the post colonial and human rights. The curriculum is aimed at graduate students from diverse disciplines who want to explore creative media practice as a research methodology. This course provides students with theoretical and practical grounding in multi-sited action research in trans-cultural and transnational settings. Through social historical and trans-cultural ethnographic perspectives practice-led pedagogy promotes a self- reflexive contextual and critical understanding of the use of media for the conduct and dissemination of research and the creation of social knowledge through participatory cultural production. Practice-Led Media Research is the theory, social history pedagogy and circulation of social science and humanities research through the production of film, video, internet, visual arts and other screen/audio based media. Practice-led research overcomes divisions between social theory and action-research, and between creative practice and evidence-based research. An important focus is the use of visual media to convey ideas and distinctive understandings about the world. There is a strong emphasis on comprehending visual phenomena in cross-cultural perspective and on the multifarious roles played by media in processes of identity and cultural formation in the world today.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2167 - Transnational Media Flows   This class will study the global landscape of media flows, particularly television and film, and its specific configurations at regional and national levels. Rooted in the idea of media as cultural industries we will identify the supranational regional players from some of the most important geo-linguistic markets around the world, where the tensions of global/transnational media and cultural audience's dynamics at local levels become more evident. We will examine the implications of these industrial/cultural dynamics from both theories that denounce the homogenizing cultural effect produce by global media, as well as approaches that underscore the rising of counter-flow trends based on audiences' preferences. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2169 - Globalization, Memory, and Visual Culture   This course examines the intersections of global visual culture and cultural memory, with a particular focus on the tensions that arise between the largely national tendencies of cultural memory and the global circulation of cultural meaning. We will focus on the ways that the nation, colonialism, and globalization have been enacted through visual culture and cultural memory with a particular focus on France, in comparison to other national contexts.    The course provides an overview of contemporary theoretical engagements with cultural memory, visual culture, and consumerism, looking at the role played by discourses of memory in changing concepts of nation, colonialism-postcolonialism, and globalization. The course will begin by examining how cultural memory and memorialization have been deployed in the context of the nation, looking in particular at how national memory has been constructed in France. We will look at how the concept of national memory becomes contested, and the institutions through which the memory of France and the French Empire have been constructed. We will thus consider the tensions between the emerging identities of transnationalism and globalization and the traditional frameworks of national memory. How cultural memory is enacted through visual culture will be a key theme of the course, looking at memorials, museums, artistic projects, design, and architecture as central to how cultural memory is shaped. We will situate these projects in relation to the memory industry and global consumer economy, through which cultural memory is packaged, branded, and consumed. These intersections&mdash;memory, visual culture, consumerism, nationalism, colonialism, and globalization&mdash;will frame our inquiries.    This course will be an intensive three-week course in Paris, organized in collaboration with the American University of Paris. We will have a number of field trips and site visits, including the Musee Carnavalet, the Quai Branley museum of French colonialism, the Cite de l&rsquo;Immigration, and a day trip to Normandy and the World War II museum in Caen.    Note: This couse will be offered in Paris in Summer 2014. Department approval needed. More information is available here .    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2171 - Screening History: The Construction of American History in Hollywood   This course explores how popular Hollywood films construct versions of the historical past, and can be utilized as historical documents themselves. The films reach mass audiences, they entertain, they mythologize, they produce compelling narratives about the past, they simplify complex problems, and they have been influential in creating audiences&rsquo; historical understanding. Hollywood films are significant and complex cultural texts, and this course will study them as artifacts of a powerful communications entertainment industry whose visions of the past and arguments regarding social, political, economic order throughout the 20 th century and into the 21 st centuries warrants our close examination.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-GE 2173 - Research for Communication Professionals   The course has two parts. One is providing the student with an understanding of media research as used to measure usage and behavior and to commodify audiences for sale to support content. Exposure to the measurement tools such as ratings, time spent, reach, engagement, WOM, CTR, by such firms as Google, ComScore, Nielsen, Arbitron, and others, will be part of this. Two is how research is done on the media to understand people's attitudes, opinions and behavior. This will consist of exposure to a variety of different studies on different aspects of the media as well as exposure to different methodologies and techniques. It will also consist of the student participating in a simulated media research project on how to conduct a research study. Both these parts of the class will be taught in the context of the digital media environment that is causing a revolution in measurement, re-shaping platforms and the economics of the business. Digital media is upsetting the media business as not only can it measure people's individual behavior but creates research data that can predict behavior as well as tell people what they want to consume. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2191 - Print Media and Modernity   This seminar will explore the evolution of print technology and culture since Gutenberg's first experiments with movable type. Our objective will be to arrive at an understanding of how print media have formed and transformed essential features of the culture of capitalism. Themes will include the rise of the bourgeois individual, public/private spheres, production of difference, erotics of reading, urban space and spectacle, high/low culture, bureaucracy. Although the emphasis will be on the history of the book, the course will also examine newspapers, paper money, identity documents, and other printed matter. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2200 - Media Events and Spectacle   An inquiry into those forces in our technological society, especially those of the mass media that significantly influence our beliefs, attitudes &amp; actions. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2201 - Mediating the Bio-political Body   This seminar seeks to build media theory within the material histories, philosophy and political culture of embodiment/disembodiment. The body is situated as the interface of our era's most contentious political terrains including human rights violations, epidermal stigma, gendered gazes, targeting gazes, and confinement in refugee, detention, torture and concentration camps. For Foucault the formation of the political subject is isomorphic to the formation of the body as a communicative, mediating and mediated site. The body has become the screen, the archive and the stylus for political inscription and encryption. For Foucault, Agamben and Esposito the political is concerned with producing forms of life as biopower-- the governing of life and death through subject forming and deforming body-media from surveillance to violence. Previously Hegel, Kojeve, Lacan and Fanon theorized political domination as the spectral occupation and remediation of one body by another. Derrida described the current war on terror as the shift from communitas to immunitas, to auto-co-immunity in which the body-politic sacrifices its actuality to protect itself as virtuality. In the above theories the body unfolds as the place where our current historical actuality originates and culminates in a politics of somatic virtuality. We will examine the body as a political semiotechnique, as material support for political ideology and spectacle and as enabled/disabled by techno-political prosthetics and as the means of political virtualization. We will track several orienting genealogies of the body that roughly run from Hegel and Kojeve to Lacan and Fanon; from Spinoza, Nietzsche and Heidegger, to Deleuze, Foucault, Agamben, Esposito and Derrida; from Merleau-Ponty to Lefort and Ranciere. Among the themes to be explored are: exposability and disposability of the body; torture, embodied witnessing and truth; postcolonial typographies of the body; second bodies, subversive mimesis and political virtuality; political animality and monstrosity; communicable and excommunicated bodies; political violence as auto-immunization. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2202 - Public Sphere Formation   The unprecedented visibility both of everyday life, and of the mediatization that makes this visibility possible, shift and transform society and the conditions of knowledge about it. We will approach these issues as questions pertaining to public sphere formation. We will begin with two distinct but related arguments about the public-private opposition, namely Habermas's influential formulation drawing on Kant, and Hannah Arendt's, that draws on ancient Greek philosophy. In this course we will consider the problems attending any attempt to construct a theoretical genealogy for the terms \"public\" and \"private,\" and examine as well specific cultural-political mobilizations, and techno-institutional elaborations of these terms, and some of the implications arising from these definitions, mobilizations and instantiations.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2206 - Dis/ability Studies: Media, Philosophy, and Visual Culture   Introduction to the concepts used in the new interdisciplinary field of disability studies. This seminar will be a joint exploration of the necessarily connected experience and representation of dis/ability, embodiment and the \"normal\" in modern Western culture. It centers on questions of dis/ability in the three fields at three critical interfaces, namely the formation of Western rationality in the seventeenth century;the generalization and medicalization of the concept of the \"normal\" in the nineteenth century; and the emergence of dis/ability as a new form of identity in the past forty years. sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2210 - Globalization and Gender   This course will examine how definitions of gender and sexuality are reproduced, negotiated and deployed in the context of globalization and transnational flows. We will examine key texts drawn from feminist/global cultural studies on the topics of citizenship, global labor flows, migration, militarization, neoliberalism and the construction of the gendered global subject. Through a reading of theoretical texts, ethnographic case studies and analysis of media representation, we will engage with questions of feminist epistemology and method research.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2211- Decolonization and its Aftermath   The advent of 20th century decolonization challenged the way in which world history had been conceived for four centuries, as centered upon the tiny landmass of Western Europe, rather than say, as plural and polycentric. The former view made it difficult to understand how the majority of the world's population mattered to history at all. With the onset of decolonization after the end of World War I, the world began to be seen, first through the lens of the nation, and secondly, as an extensive set of interconnections, where seemingly remote events could have major effects across countries. This course will combine a survey of select decolonization movements with analyses of the transformations from anticolonial nationalism through postcolonial developmentalism to the contemporary new world order. The course will consider decolonization in two senses: as the historical achievement of independence in former colonies, and, as a communicational concept illuminating socio-political change. sample syllabus 1    sample syllabus 2          MCC-GE 2220 - Communication and the Culture Industries     An examination of the ways the entertainment industries exercise their communicative power. Provides a wide-ranging overview of theoretical &amp; empirical research on the industrial manufacture of popular culture, focusing on sociologies of production &amp; on the ongoing processes of digitization and globalization.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2251 - Communication Environments: Macroanalysis   Inquiries into \"the business behind the box\": the economic &amp; decision-making structure of broadcast television.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2284 - Religion and Media    Bertrand Russell long ago declared that religion belonged to the infancy of human history, in a statement that expressed the secular self-understanding of an enlightened European of his time. By comparison, at least from the time of Alexis de Tocqueville, it has been clear that in a country like the United States, religious affiliation has not diminished with the advance of historical time. If anything the movement has been in a contrary direction, with religion having increased in social and political influence, with effects that reverberate across the globe today. The disparity between Continental and American perceptions reflects a failure to understand the place of religion in modern society, and to relate changes in religious practice to historical change. It is not simply in traditional, backward or disadvantaged societies that religion thrives, but in the very heart of modern society, so to speak. The legislative approach to sequester religion and keep it in its place, widely practiced, rarely has the desired results. Religion turns out to be mediated in new ways, to sacralize new forms of connection, to mark out new relations between the sacred and the profane.    Note: This couse may be offered in Paris. Consult your academic advisor for further information.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2286 - Young People & Media Cultures   In this course students explore the debates and issues raised by various media environments as these relate to young people's growth and experiences. Students investigate how young people actually use, value, and find meaning in multiple media in different social contexts, and discuss the social, cultural, and political implications of these situations. Finally, students propose how to deal with the issues raised by the readings and discussions. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2287 - Global Youth Media   This graduate level course explores the contextual purposes, practices, and outcomes of youth media projects that use a variety ofcommunication and media technologies in different locations around theworld. Students will examine research into why and how youth createand distribute multiple media in different locales, and investigate inwhat ways these activities support the development of young people&rsquo;scapacities for 21st century skills of digital communication, criticalliteracy, civic engagement, media appreciation, and personalexpression.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2310 - Sound Studies   This course examines central themes in the emerging field of 'Sound Studies'. We explore a range of histories, archeologies and ethnographies of sound and listening, as it intersects with topics in media studies, science and technology studies, political economy and musicology. How has our experience of sound changed as we move from the piano to the personal computer, from the phonoautograph to the mp3? How have political, commercial, and cultural forces shaped what we are able to listen to, and how we listen to it? Finally, how have performers, physiologists, acousticians, engineers and philosophers worked to understand this radical transformation of the senses?  Students should be able to describe and analyze technologies of sound production and reproduction over the last two centuries. They should also be able to describe, contrast and analyze (1) disciplinary, (2) metaphysical, (3) ideological, and (4) musical approaches to sound and listening over the last two centuries. Finally, students should be able to critically assess the way various communicative media have shaped how sound is made, used and heard in our times.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2344 - The Social Life of Paper    What is the cultural work performed by or with the technology of paper? How can a history of paper supplement and enrich recent histories of printing technology and printed artifacts like \"the book\"? What would it mean to imagine a paperless future? Organized around discussions of readings in common, this course considers the history, production, circulation and use of paper in the social production of knowledge, the shared imagination of value, and the mutual relations of consumers and commodities.    sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2351 - Global Food Cultures    An interdisciplinary and intercultural examination of human communication through food. The course explores the social, economic, political, and cultural ramifications of the technology, production, acquisition, preservation, packaging, distribution, promotion, representation, selling, presentation, and consumption of food, as well as the disposal of food-related wastes. Students will have a unique opportunity to explore various local, regional, and transnational cuisines and food rituals in Hong Kong as the manifestation of changing social norms, economic realities, and cultural beliefs in an increasingly global and multicultural city.    Note: This couse is offered in Hong Kong. Consult your academic advisor for further information.       Sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2381 - Topics in Globalization: Global Consumer Culture   Consumer culture by its nature is intensely local and inevitably global. Its locality is tied up with the intimacy of food, clothing, and shelter, and the elasticity of the relationship between bodies and things, yet its meanings and messages are globally circulated and produced. Consumption is a flash point for social and political debates about the relationship between needs and desires. This course explores critical approaches to the globalization of consumer culture by exploring the ways in which bodies and things shape each other through long histories (colonial, postcolonial, global) of production, distribution, and fashion. Students will study the social world of global consumers as an analytic entry point into the complex networks of cultural practice which mediate the perennial tension between habituation and novelty in the shaping of consumer experience in the context of globalization.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2402 - Topics in Visual Culture and Cultural Studies: The Political History of Visual Display and Representation   This course is a political analysis of the modern history of visual display and exhibition, tracing it from the Russian avant-garde to issues of spectacle, the ideological function of the museum, and public art. The critique of institutions such as museums is an area of inquiry in visual culture. This course analyzes concepts of the public, the avant garde, spectacle, the function of exhibitions in totalitarian political regimes, the concept of exhibition as resistance, and the relationship of urban economies and visual display. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2403 - Topics in Visual Culture and Cultural Studies: Visuality and Globalization   Visual culture studies visuality as a key component of globalization. By visuality, we mean the visualization of history, composed of images, ideas and the imagination. This class introduces present-day visualized globalization in historical context and offers students ways to research visual culture in the intersections between globalizations past and present. In the first half of the class, lectures and discussion trace the concept of visuality from its emergence in the 19th century to its uses in imperial regimes and the neo-visuality of the present. We consider how visuality imagines history as war, visible only to the Hero, or Great Man, and consider alternatives proposed by abolitionists, indigenous people, and the labor movement. The second half of the class will be a series of visual media-based workshops from painting and photography to film and digital media, discussing strategies and approaches to research as well as offering students the opportunity to use primary and archival materials. Students will develop a project proposal that might be developed into a thesis, article or mixed-media project. sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2405 - Topics in Visual Culture and Cultural Studies: Communism and the Cold War   In the era of the permanent memorial, it is noticeable that Communism and the Cold War are being increasingly marginalized in accounts of present-day crises. This class offers a counterpoint by examining the legacies of these experiences in visual and cultural studies. It suggests a different history of the present than is usually told, with particular regard to visuality in film, art and performance. Each participant will undertake a research project using materials in the Tamiment Library (and elsewhere if needed) and will present the results in a mini-conference at the end of the semester.    sample syllabus           MCC-GE 2406 - Special Topics in Visual Culture and Cultural Studies: Semiotics of Media, Art and Performance   This seminar will explore semiotics and performance theory by comparing the modes ofperformance used in media (including television, film, radio, advertising, theater, music andvisual art) with social performance in general. Readings will draw from classic and contemporary work in semiotics, performance theory and linguistic anthropology, analyzing media and art forms from around the world. Students willengage with the theoretical concepts and analytical models encountered in class by applying them to a media form, performance or piece of art of their own choosing. Sample Topics List          MCC-GE 2420 - Visual Culture Methods   In the  wake of the Arab Spring and the Occupy movements worldwide, especially Occupy  Wall St here in New York, how can we study the interface of visualized media  and politics? This course provides a participatory introduction to the methods  of critical visuality studies from a wide range of perspectives. The class will  develop and explore horizontal means of occupying visual culture.    Sample syllabus          MCC-GE 2836 - Culture and Media in Urban China   This graduate workshop combines an interdisciplinary seminar on methods in China studies and a &ldquo;writing group&rdquo; format for graduate students developing original research on historical and contemporary formations of Chinese media and material culture: historical documents, art, photography, films, television shows, legal cases, novels, magazines, blogs and microblogs, material objects, ritual events, etc. We will read from outstanding books in China studies, including sociology, history, art history, anthropology, and media studies. Our discussion of these readings will focus on comparing methodological and analytical approaches to a range of text/objects, and contrasting forms of argument that focus on: 1) &ldquo;cosmology&rdquo; (cultures, conceptual schemes, languages, ideologies); 2) &ldquo;politics&rdquo;(conflict, difference, distinction); and 3) &ldquo;structure&rdquo; (networks and systems, kinship, clientalism, bureaucracy). Over the course of the semester students will develop analyses of their own text/objects, and use these analyses to develop journal articles, MA theses, or dissertation chapters.    sample syllabus                    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
