You will not necessarily need to pay taxes; but you must at least report your presence in the U.S. This is a legal requirement.   Although OGS staff cannot advise on tax issues, we hope to give you basic information here as a helpful starting point.                  Do I have to file?                   If you first arrived in the U.S. on or after January 1, 2015 and if you were not present in the U.S. at all during 2014, you currently have no tax filing obligations \u2014 but you will need to file next year, so check back then on what to do.   If you were present in the U.S. for even one day during 2014 you have tax filing obligations. Keep reading for when, what and how to file.                   When to file                   The earliest we recommend you file your taxes is February 1 as the government updates their forms each year and these new forms are only ready in late January. The tax filing deadline to file is April 15 . If you are unable to file your forms by that due date, you must submit an Application for Automatic Extension of Time to File Your Tax Return Form 4868 to the Internal Revenue Service.                  What and how to file                  Step 1: Gather the following documents and information as references you may need.   (Note: You may not have or need some of these; this is a list of all the documents you might need.)       Passport, Visa, I-94 record   Your Exit and Entry Dates for all past U.S. visits   Your I-20, DS-2019, or other immigration documents   Social Security number (if you do not have a Social Security number, you will need an Individual Tax Identification Number, which can be obtained through GLACIER Tax Prep; see step 2)     Current U.S. Address AND Permanent Foreign Address   Name of Educational Institution or Sponsoring Organization   Form(s) W-2, 1042-S, 1099   Scholarship or Fellowship grant letters (if no related Form 1042-S)   Copy of past year\u2019s tax forms (if you had any)                    Step 2: Use GLACIER Tax Prep (GTP) to file your federal tax return and/or forms.   NYU has purchased GTP software to help you fulfil your tax obligations. GTP will ask you a series of questions and will use your answers to fill in all necessary U.S. government tax forms for you. It will also inform you of any tax treaty benefits that may apply to you.     1. Access the GTP log in page with your NYU net ID and password. If your NYU Net ID is not active, first visit https://start.nyu.edu . If you are still having difficulty activating your account, then contact AskITS@nyu.edu .                                                              2. Log into GTP. If you have a GLACIER account through NYU OR you used GTP last year, be sure to use your same user name and password. If you have never used GTP and do not have a GLACIER account, create a new account.   3. Once logged in, answer the questions in GTP. Once submitted, GTP will determine your tax return filing requirements.   4. Print the forms GTP generates. Review, sign and mail them no later than April 15. Note: non-resident taxes cannot be submitted electronically; GTP will tell you the mailing address to use.   5. If GTP determines that you are a resident for U.S.tax purposes, it will not generate your tax forms. You should file resident tax returns \u2014 the same thing U.S. citizens do. Resources for this include:     Free File   TurboTax   H&amp;R Block   VITA service s                    Step 3: Confirm whether you had U.S. income during 2014 \u2014   GTP will have helped you figure this out. Note that U.S. income includes earned wages, as well as some non-NYU scholarships, stipends, prizes, awards, winnings, etc.       If you had no U.S. income during 2014 you are not required to file a state tax return. Send in your signed federal forms and you will be done for the year!                    Step 4: If you had U.S. income during 2014, you also must file a state tax return.   Note: State taxes may have different residency guidelines then U.S. taxes. You can use Sprintax to file your state taxes at a discounted rate.

Review NY state\u2019s definition of tax residency to determine your NY tax filing status.           Be sure to note the definition of permanent place of abode in NY .

Good to Know:    Tax Treaties     The United States has over 50 tax treaties with different countries. The treaties vary in terms of the benefits they offer to students, the types of income covered, the total amount of the exemption, and the number of years you could claim the benefit. If you file your tax forms with a tax software, the software will automatically factor in any benefit offered through a tax treaty with your country.   For more information on tax treaties, including a list of the countries that the United States has tax treaties with, see IRS Publication 901 , U.S. Tax Treaties. Note that tax treaties vary in their implications for state taxes.
