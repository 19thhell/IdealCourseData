There are two concurrent workshops held over three weeks: one for high school students preparing for college auditions and the other for college and graduate students preparing for competitions and/or graduate school auditions. The intensity of the schedule and exacting performance standards make SummerStrings most appropriate for serious, dedicated musicians ages 15-25.       These audition workshops will give you the skills you need to forge ahead with confidence! Under the guidance of NYU string faculty members, many of whom have won major competitions and orchestral auditions, you will spend your days putting together the elements needed for a successful audition. Faculty will assist you in preparing solo Bach, concerti, showpieces and etudes. You will learn sports psychology techniques to help deal with performance anxiety such as centering, mental practice and the perfect formula for audition preparation.       SummerStrings is pleased to offer Alexander Technique sessions to correct posture and teach bodily self-awareness. Participants who struggle with persistent bad habits have the opportunity to learn a ground-breaking method of overcoming them in as little as an hour. A select few participants will also have the opportunity to make a fully edited recording in NYU&rsquo;s state-of-the-art James L. Dolan Studio .       Upon completion of the course, you will have a clearer understanding of the audition process that will enable you to achieve your goals!    Courses and Faculty    Both programs include:          Two private lessons per week    One hour of daily chamber music rehearsal or coaching    One hour classes held each afternoon on a series of topics ranging from building confidence through audition strategies to developing one&rsquo;s musical voice through improvisation and freedom of expression    Five hours of daily practice time    Performance opportunities at bi-weekly student performances, master classes and chamber music recitals    Evening and weekend activities that in the past have included NY Philharmonic concerts, sightseeing in New York City and visits to museums          NYU Artist faculty include Cyrus Beroukhim , Stephanie Chase , Gregory Fulkerson , Kikuei Ikeda , Anton Miller , Naoko Tanaka , violin; Stephanie Baer , Shmuel Katz , Karen Ritscher , viola; Marion Feldman , Eileen Moon , Edward Arron , cello; Joseph Bongiorno , bass; Edward Malave , Alexander Technique and Justin Hines, improvisation.
