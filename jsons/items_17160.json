BSc, PhD   University College London/Imperial. MSc     Ed's PhD looked into the role of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments in corals. Since joing NYUAD in 2012, he has been investigating the mechanisms used by corals in the extreme conditions of the Gulf, in the hope of improving the understanding of whether/how corals will adapt to future climate change. Ed is also looking at the population structure and connectivity of corals within and outside of the Gulf.

BSc   Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) Ph.D     Emily's PhD evaluated the importance of algal endosymbionts in shaping the thermal tolerance of corals. While based at NYUAD, Emily\u2019s goal is to identify traits of Arabian Gulf corals that enable them to withstand extremely hot temperatures and apply these findings to assess potential climate change responses of corals in other regions.

BSc, PhD   University College London/Imperial. MSc     Ed's PhD looked into the role of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like pigments in corals. Since joing NYUAD in 2012, he has been investigating the mechanisms used by corals in the extreme conditions of the Gulf, in the hope of improving the understanding of whether/how corals will adapt to future climate change. Ed is also looking at the population structure and connectivity of corals within and outside of the Gulf.

BSc   Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) Ph.D     Emily's PhD evaluated the importance of algal endosymbionts in shaping the thermal tolerance of corals. While based at NYUAD, Emily\u2019s goal is to identify traits of Arabian Gulf corals that enable them to withstand extremely hot temperatures and apply these findings to assess potential climate change responses of corals in other regions.

ecology in extreme environments and to understand how these may serve as a model for the possible impacts of future climate change on reefs elsewhere.                                                                             Current research seeks to examine how coral communities in these extreme environments respond to and recover from mass bleaching events, and how variation in environmental conditions affect biogeographic patterns of community structure of corals, fish, and other reef biota in the region. The current research of our 2 post-doctoral researchers focuses on molecular biology, coral physiology and coral reproduction to understand how corals cope in the uniquely extreme environment of the Gulf.
