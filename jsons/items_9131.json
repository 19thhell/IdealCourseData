In addition to distinguished senior scholars and critics, the faculty includes many younger members of solid achievement and growing reputation. This outstanding group of teachers represents a broad spectrum of specialization in all areas of French literature and civilization, as well as critical theory, the history of ideas, cultural studies, and Francophone studies.   The Institute of French Studies  NYU's Institute of French Studies, is this country's premier multidisciplinary center for the study of modern France. Its resident faculty of specialists in history, anthropology, French, politics, and art history, together with its distinguished visiting professors from France make it unique in the United States. Established in 1978 with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the IFS focuses on French culture, history, politics, economics and society. It draws upon the strengths of New York University's world-class faculty in the humanities and social sciences and on the vast cultural riches of New York City.
