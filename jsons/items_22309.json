Sharkey          12/03/2013               In a 2011 public opinion poll, The Pew Charitable Trusts asked Americans how important they thought a number of factors were in determining whether people in the United States get ahead or fall behind economically. More than 80 percent of respondents identified factors such as hard work, ambition, and access to education as key drivers of upward mobility, while less than half viewed growing up in a good neighborhood as an important factor. On the contrary, respondents strongly agreed that a young person with drive, ambition, and creativity growing up in a poor neighborhood is more likely to get ahead economically than someone growing up in a more affluent neighborhood who lacks those attributes.      Contrary to these perceptions, however, evidence is building that location actually matters a great deal and that Americans\u2019 economic mobility prospects vary by state, locality, and even neighborhood.      For example, a 2009 Pew study indicated that a person who experienced high neighborhood poverty throughout childhood had a much higher risk of moving down the economic ladder as an adult. Other recent research examining mobility among metropolitan areas, including nearby towns and rural areas, showed that economic mobility varied widely across these localities. And, in a 2012, first-of-its-kind analysis of Americans\u2019 economic mobility at the state level, Pew found that a number of states, primarily in the Mideast and New England regions, had higher mobility than the national average, and other states, primarily in the South, had lower mobility.      This report adds to the growing body of research as it examines economic mobility across 96 U.S. metropolitan areas and the role of place in Americans\u2019 prospects of moving up or down the economic ladder. It also offers insight on why and how location matters. Although a host of factors, such as state and local policies and labor market conditions, could influence mobility, this analysis considers one: neighborhood economic segregation, or the degree to which the poor and the wealthy live apart from each other. To begin to answer this question, Pew commissioned original research that, using three longitudinal data sets, measures differences in economic mobility across American metro areas over the last generation and identifies above-average-, average-, and below-average-mobility areas. The analysis then looks at whether metro areas\u2019 rates of economic segregation are related to their rates of economic mobility.

Speakers will examine how cities face a wide range of issues, including innovation and entrepreneurship, infrastructure and resiliency, design and creativity, and density and sustainability.   The conference, created by CityAge, will take place on Tuesday, June 18, and Wednesday, June 19, at NYU\u2019s Eisner and Lubin Auditorium on the 4th floor of the Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South, New York City.   Press coverage is welcome. Media can RSVP at info@cityage.org .   \u201cThe Global Metropolis will explore the great challenges that confront us as well as the opportunities for innovation and progress as we live through the greatest rate of urbanization in human history,\u201d said NYU President John Sexton. \u201cHow we build, rebuild, and sustain our cities ranks among the most consequential choices of our time. Our future economies, our local and planetary environments, and the standards of living of billions of people will depend on the decisions we make in this age of the city.\u201d   The conference reinforces NYU\u2019s historic connection to cities and urban scholarship. Founded in 1831 in New York City to be \u201cin and of the city,\u201d NYU recently created two new academic centers focused on urban policy:   \u2022 The Marron Institute on Cities and Urban Environment, which sponsors interdisciplinary research to help cities become more livable, sustainable, and equitable; and   \u2022 The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory to help cities become more productive and resilient.   Attendees will come from cities around the world, including Mexico City, Shenzhen-China; Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Seoul-South Korea, London, Toronto, Copenhagen-Denmark, Manchester-UK, Quezon City-Philippines, Vancouver, Atlanta, Seattle, Kansas City, and many more.   The conference will feature more than 60 speakers, including: Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed; former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley; Lightyear Capital Chairman Donald B. Marron; Bruce Katz, vice president, Brookings Institute; Bjarke Ingels, founding architect, BIG; Richard Barkham, research director, the Grosvenor Group; NYC Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan; NYC Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden; NYC EDC President Seth Pinsky; NYC DEP Commissioner Carter Strickland; and many others. See the full list of speakers here .   NYU participants include Mr. Sexton; Mr. Marron, chairman of the Marron Institute Advisory Board and an NYU trustee; Fred Wilson, managing partner at Union Square Ventures and an NYU trustee; Paul Romer, Marron Institute director; Steven Koonin, CUSP director; Constantine Kontokosta, CUSP deputy director; Vicki Been, director of NYU\u2019s Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy; and Anthony Townsend, adjunct assistant professor of planning at the NYU Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.   \u201cThis is a unique opportunity to converse directly with the people who are building \u2014 and rebuilding \u2014 the worlds\u2019 cities in a period of profound change,\u201d said Miro Cernetig, co-founder of CityAge America. \u201cHow we build our cities in this generation will hold consequences for centuries to come. This is a focus on the solutions that can chart a sustainable and prosperous path for the world\u2019s cities.\u201d   CityAge holds events around North America to explore the business of city building. More than 3,000 people have attended CityAge forums, which Ron Bogle, the president of the American Architectural Foundation, has called one of the leading urban forums.   &quot;CityAge brings together the leaders driving that change for informed and insightful discussions about what\u2019s working, what\u2019s not, and what\u2019s next,&quot; said Bogle, who is master of ceremonies at the two-day gathering. &quot;The future of cities is being shaped at CityAge.\u201d   About NYU:   Founded in 1831, NYU is one of the world\u2019s foremost research universities and is a member of the selective Association of American Universities. NYU has degree-granting university campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai; has eleven other global academic sites, including London, Paris, Florence, Tel Aviv, Buenos Aires, and Accra; and sends more students to study abroad than any other U.S. college or university. Through its numerous schools and colleges, NYU conducts research and provides education in the arts and sciences, law, medicine, business, dentistry, education, nursing, the cinematic and performing arts, music and studio arts, public administration, social work, and continuing and professional studies, among other areas.

Sharkey          12/03/2013               In a 2011 public opinion poll, The Pew Charitable Trusts asked Americans how important they thought a number of factors were in determining whether people in the United States get ahead or fall behind economically. More than 80 percent of respondents identified factors such as hard work, ambition, and access to education as key drivers of upward mobility, while less than half viewed growing up in a good neighborhood as an important factor. On the contrary, respondents strongly agreed that a young person with drive, ambition, and creativity growing up in a poor neighborhood is more likely to get ahead economically than someone growing up in a more affluent neighborhood who lacks those attributes.      Contrary to these perceptions, however, evidence is building that location actually matters a great deal and that Americans\u2019 economic mobility prospects vary by state, locality, and even neighborhood.      For example, a 2009 Pew study indicated that a person who experienced high neighborhood poverty throughout childhood had a much higher risk of moving down the economic ladder as an adult. Other recent research examining mobility among metropolitan areas, including nearby towns and rural areas, showed that economic mobility varied widely across these localities. And, in a 2012, first-of-its-kind analysis of Americans\u2019 economic mobility at the state level, Pew found that a number of states, primarily in the Mideast and New England regions, had higher mobility than the national average, and other states, primarily in the South, had lower mobility.      This report adds to the growing body of research as it examines economic mobility across 96 U.S. metropolitan areas and the role of place in Americans\u2019 prospects of moving up or down the economic ladder. It also offers insight on why and how location matters. Although a host of factors, such as state and local policies and labor market conditions, could influence mobility, this analysis considers one: neighborhood economic segregation, or the degree to which the poor and the wealthy live apart from each other. To begin to answer this question, Pew commissioned original research that, using three longitudinal data sets, measures differences in economic mobility across American metro areas over the last generation and identifies above-average-, average-, and below-average-mobility areas. The analysis then looks at whether metro areas\u2019 rates of economic segregation are related to their rates of economic mobility.

Speakers will examine how cities face a wide range of issues, including innovation and entrepreneurship, infrastructure and resiliency, design and creativity, and density and sustainability.   The conference, created by CityAge, will take place on Tuesday, June 18, and Wednesday, June 19, at NYU\u2019s Eisner and Lubin Auditorium on the 4th floor of the Kimmel Center, 60 Washington Square South, New York City.   Press coverage is welcome. Media can RSVP at info@cityage.org .   \u201cThe Global Metropolis will explore the great challenges that confront us as well as the opportunities for innovation and progress as we live through the greatest rate of urbanization in human history,\u201d said NYU President John Sexton. \u201cHow we build, rebuild, and sustain our cities ranks among the most consequential choices of our time. Our future economies, our local and planetary environments, and the standards of living of billions of people will depend on the decisions we make in this age of the city.\u201d   The conference reinforces NYU\u2019s historic connection to cities and urban scholarship. Founded in 1831 in New York City to be \u201cin and of the city,\u201d NYU recently created two new academic centers focused on urban policy:   \u2022 The Marron Institute on Cities and Urban Environment, which sponsors interdisciplinary research to help cities become more livable, sustainable, and equitable; and   \u2022 The Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP), a public-private research center that uses New York City as its laboratory to help cities become more productive and resilient.   Attendees will come from cities around the world, including Mexico City, Shenzhen-China; Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Seoul-South Korea, London, Toronto, Copenhagen-Denmark, Manchester-UK, Quezon City-Philippines, Vancouver, Atlanta, Seattle, Kansas City, and many more.   The conference will feature more than 60 speakers, including: Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed; former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley; Lightyear Capital Chairman Donald B. Marron; Bruce Katz, vice president, Brookings Institute; Bjarke Ingels, founding architect, BIG; Richard Barkham, research director, the Grosvenor Group; NYC Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan; NYC Planning Commissioner Amanda Burden; NYC EDC President Seth Pinsky; NYC DEP Commissioner Carter Strickland; and many others.
