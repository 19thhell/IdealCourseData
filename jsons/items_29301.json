Nearly 100 people completed the course, and many more expressed interest or stopped by over the three-day period. The course, which was free, was open to faculty and students from medical and dental institutions across the city and state. Faculty received CME/CDE credits, and students received a certificate of participation upon completion of the course.   The event marked the first time that dentists have participated in such a comprehensive program in New York City. The goal was to give participants the opportunity to educate and prepare themselves to respond appropriately in the event of a catastrophic public health crisis. Training included classroom lectures and demonstrations, as well as hands-on demonstrations of triage and decontamination of people exposed to chemical and biological agents.   Dean Alfano said, \u201cNYU as well as other medical and dental centers in the New York City area have been working together on this particular issue of terrorism preparedness, and we are pleased that the Army agreed to produce this course for medical and dental faculty and students in the NYC/NYS area. As 9/11 demonstrated, it is important, as health care providers, that we educate ourselves for potential catastrophic events, such as a chemical attack.\u201d   Dr. Dianne Rekow, Director of Translational Research at the NYU College of Dentistry and Chairperson of NYUCD\u2019s Bioterrorism and Catastrophe Response Task Force, who helped organize the course, said, \u201cExperts from disparate disciplines, such as academic and clinical dentistry, medicine and public health, emergency management, fire departments, and the military, had the opportunity to engage in discussions that we hope will set the stage for future collaboration. The outcomes of such collaboration should further strengthen New York City\u2019s ability to respond to threats and reaffirm its innovation and leadership in catastrophe preparedness principles and policy.\u201d   Recent months have seen a great deal of activity surrounding the issue of a role for dentistry in bioterrorism preparedness. Here are some highlights:     The ADEA annual meeting included a symposium on dentistry and terrorism preparedness. The featured speaker at the annual meeting, New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia C. Novello, subsequently invited Dean Alfano to meet with her in Albany to present his ideas on this issue.   The ADA and HHS cosponsored a major conference on bioterrorism and dentistry\u2019s response at which Dean Alfano and Dr. Rekow were featured speakers.   Dean Alfano made a presentation to Dr. Thomas Frieden, NYC\u2019s Health Commissioner, about using dentists\u2019 offices as inoculation sites or places to dispense medications in the event of an emergency, thereby greatly expanding access to care for the general public and sparing physicians and other health professionals to do other things in times of crisis. His presentation led to the inclusion of dentists in the NYC emergency plan for mass inoculations for smallpox. The plan calls for about 2,000 dentists to receive certification to deliver the vaccine, along with other health care providers. This action makes NYC the first city to officially \u201csanction\u201d dentists to do these inoculations.   Under Dr. Rekow\u2019s direction, NYUCD is implementing the creation of educational modules related to terrorism preparedness and response as part of the overall curriculum. This initiative has garnered support from state and national dental organizations and academic dental centers.   The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Dental School (UMDNJ) and NYUCD have independently developed catastrophe preparedness plans, including a \u201cshelter in place\u201d component. The two schools will get together soon to compare notes.   Dr. Rekow was part of an all-university group that traveled to Washington, D.C., to brief the New York Congressional delegation on activities in progress at the NYU Center for Catastrophe Preparedness.

This course aims to provide training in the biology, epidemiology and control of emerging diseases. It will provide the necessary skills to analyze the interplay between human host and pathogen in both evolutionary ecology and statistical epidemiology frameworks. There will be a discussion of \"Darwinian Medicine\". Specific bioterrorism pathogens will be discussed, as well as methods of identification and predictive modeling of a bioterrorism incident. In addition to lectures, class time will include practical data handling. Discussion of both methodological and substantive epidemiology papers from the recent literature will be led by the students.

Nearly 100 people completed the course, and many more expressed interest or stopped by over the three-day period. The course, which was free, was open to faculty and students from medical and dental institutions across the city and state. Faculty received CME/CDE credits, and students received a certificate of participation upon completion of the course.   The event marked the first time that dentists have participated in such a comprehensive program in New York City. The goal was to give participants the opportunity to educate and prepare themselves to respond appropriately in the event of a catastrophic public health crisis. Training included classroom lectures and demonstrations, as well as hands-on demonstrations of triage and decontamination of people exposed to chemical and biological agents.   Dean Alfano said, \u201cNYU as well as other medical and dental centers in the New York City area have been working together on this particular issue of terrorism preparedness, and we are pleased that the Army agreed to produce this course for medical and dental faculty and students in the NYC/NYS area. As 9/11 demonstrated, it is important, as health care providers, that we educate ourselves for potential catastrophic events, such as a chemical attack.\u201d   Dr. Dianne Rekow, Director of Translational Research at the NYU College of Dentistry and Chairperson of NYUCD\u2019s Bioterrorism and Catastrophe Response Task Force, who helped organize the course, said, \u201cExperts from disparate disciplines, such as academic and clinical dentistry, medicine and public health, emergency management, fire departments, and the military, had the opportunity to engage in discussions that we hope will set the stage for future collaboration. The outcomes of such collaboration should further strengthen New York City\u2019s ability to respond to threats and reaffirm its innovation and leadership in catastrophe preparedness principles and policy.\u201d   Recent months have seen a great deal of activity surrounding the issue of a role for dentistry in bioterrorism preparedness. Here are some highlights:     The ADEA annual meeting included a symposium on dentistry and terrorism preparedness. The featured speaker at the annual meeting, New York State Health Commissioner Dr. Antonia C. Novello, subsequently invited Dean Alfano to meet with her in Albany to present his ideas on this issue.   The ADA and HHS cosponsored a major conference on bioterrorism and dentistry\u2019s response at which Dean Alfano and Dr. Rekow were featured speakers.   Dean Alfano made a presentation to Dr. Thomas Frieden, NYC\u2019s Health Commissioner, about using dentists\u2019 offices as inoculation sites or places to dispense medications in the event of an emergency, thereby greatly expanding access to care for the general public and sparing physicians and other health professionals to do other things in times of crisis. His presentation led to the inclusion of dentists in the NYC emergency plan for mass inoculations for smallpox. The plan calls for about 2,000 dentists to receive certification to deliver the vaccine, along with other health care providers. This action makes NYC the first city to officially \u201csanction\u201d dentists to do these inoculations.   Under Dr. Rekow\u2019s direction, NYUCD is implementing the creation of educational modules related to terrorism preparedness and response as part of the overall curriculum. This initiative has garnered support from state and national dental organizations and academic dental centers.   The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Dental School (UMDNJ) and NYUCD have independently developed catastrophe preparedness plans, including a \u201cshelter in place\u201d component. The two schools will get together soon to compare notes.   Dr. Rekow was part of an all-university group that traveled to Washington, D.C., to brief the New York Congressional delegation on activities in progress at the NYU Center for Catastrophe Preparedness.
