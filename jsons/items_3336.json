Ma is the managing director of China Investment Corporation (CIC), one of China\u2019s sovereign wealth funds and the fourth largest in the world, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute . The 2012 NYU Law Magazine \u2019s profile of Ma put it succinctly: \u201cMa is China\u2019s financial front man in North America.\u201d   Ma was recently promoted to the head of CIC\u2019s North American office. Based in Toronto, CIC may soon be moving to New York City, according to the Wall Street Journal , bringing Ma back to the city where he was a Hauser Global Scholar.   Ma described his experience at NYU Law as formative, recalling in particular the broad range of perspectives and viewpoints he encountered as part of the Hauser Global Law School. \u201cThat, to me, was the base for my future career to be a global professional.\u201d   Before working with CIC, Ma worked at Barclays Capital (NY) and JP Morgan.

Invitations for the event, an opportunity for current scholars, researchers, faculty, alumni, and friends of the program to connect with one another, proved so popular that the venue had to be changed at the last minute to Vanderbilt Hall\u2019s spacious Greenberg Lounge.   Before introducing University Professor Richard Stewart , who is the chair and faculty director of the Hauser Global Law School Program, and Rita Hauser , the alumna who founded the program with her husband Gustave Hauser (LL.M. \u201957), Dean Richard Revesz described the Hauser Program as being in its second phase. \u201cHauser 1.0 was about bringing the world to NYU,\u201d he said. \u201cHauser 2.0 is about taking NYU to the world.\u201d It was certainly a global gathering, with scholars and fellows from Greece, Germany, Bosnia-Herzegovina, New Zealand, South Africa, Peru, Italy, China, England, France, and Korea in attendance.   Winston Wenyan Ma (M.C.J. \u201998), managing director and deputy chief of China Investment Corporation\u2019s Representative Office in Toronto , was the 2012 keynote speaker. In her introduction, Hauser described Ma as one of the Law School\u2019s most well-rounded graduates, someone with a foot in scholarship, law, and finance. She was absolutely correct: Ma, who worked for Davis Polk and Wardwell, JPMorgan Chase, and Barclays Capital before joining CIC, is also the author of the 2006 book Investing In China: New Opportunities in a Transforming Stock Market .   Ma\u2019s wide-ranging speech, which referenced modern scholar Niall Ferguson, Qing dynasty scholar Liang Qichao, and quantum physics, focused primarily on what he considered the three waves of Chinese modernization\u2014the opening and reform of the country in the 1980s which saw Chinese Ph.D. students studying abroad; the surging growth in the 1990s that saw ex-patriot Chinese students branch into law, management, and finance; and the most recent, post-WTO admission era in which increasing numbers of Chinese students are choosing to return to participate in their country\u2019s remarkable growth .   As the U.S. and China grapple with their increasingly intertwined roles over the coming years, Ma is one of an extremely select group of people with the experience, education, and background to provide a bridge for constructive dialogue between the two world powers . \u201cEach government must work to build domestic security and prosperity to fit its own unique political, economic, geographic, cultural, and historical circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there must be cross-border conversations and brainstorming in the broadest possible context, and the NYU and Hauser Program is the perfect venue for that. This historic time of the century calls for the collective effort of the NYU community\u2014each and every one of us.\u201d   Posted on January 27, 2012    Related Reading  Read the full text of Winston Ma's speech (PDF)   Read the 2012 Law School Magazine profile of Winston Ma   Official Website of the Canada China Chamber of Commerce   \"CIC Close to Canadian Timber Deal With Brookfield\"   Wall Street Journal , 11/6/12                                Law School News Search           &rsaquo;               @nyulaw on Twitter     Congrats to Prof. Helen Hershkoff, recipient of @nyuniversity 's Distinguished Teaching Award: http://t.co/Ynm2G6kHhj 3 hours ago  #SCOTUS to weigh in on when agencies must apply cost-benefit analysis | Daniel Cheung '16 writes @RegBlog : http://t.co/MneaAik1jX 4 hours ago TOMORROW: Catch @maddow &amp; Prof. @kenji_yoshino talking about marriage equality: http://t.co/1bLk4jt7z3 #SCOTUS http://t.co/Lj8uPbxebL 5 hours ago   VIEW ALL \u203a                                   Facebook   Twitter   YouTube   Instagram   Visitor Information   Directories   Offices and Departments   Site Map   NYU School of Law                   Prospective Info   Admissions (JD) Admissions (LLM/JSD) Areas of Study Degrees Offered Faculty Profiles Campus Map  Academics   Academic Sitemap Course Descriptions Class Schedules NYU Classes Clinics Academic Calendars  Departments   Academic Services Career Services Financial Aid Graduate Affairs (LLM) Hospitality and Events Housing Human Resources Library Operations and Facilities Records and Registration Student Affairs  Tools and Resources   About the Law School Campus Map Directories Law School News Journals Picture Book                      \u00a9 2015 New York University School of Law. 40 Washington Sq.
