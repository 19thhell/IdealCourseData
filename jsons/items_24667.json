The title is conferred upon outstanding scholars whose work reflects exceptional breadth and some of whose work is interdisciplinary. Because of this interdisciplinary dimension, the title of \u201cUniversity Professor\u201d carries a somewhat different meaning at NYU than similar titles carry at other universities.
