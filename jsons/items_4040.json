Research Fields: A frica, African Diaspora, Urban  History, Historical Cartography, Digital Humanities.           \u201cLagoon City: Lagos in the Nineteenth Century Bight of  Benin\u201d is a spatial history of Lagos between 1845 and 1868, one that takes into  account Lagos\u2019 role as the economic, political and cultural focal point of the  region. My research is rooted in urban history, but offers an interdisciplinary  response to analyzing the ways that coastal West Africans imagined, manipulated  and represented their cities. By analyzing myths of origin, songs, missionary  journals, newspapers, naval dispatches and reports, in tandem with the colonial  maps, sketches and surveys that fix and plot their ideas and activities, I  create maps paired with textual narratives to reconstruct their past in place.

Covering the period from the arrival of the SS Windrush from Jamaica in  1948 to Member of Parliament Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech  in 1968, this project situates the development of networks of communication and  Caribbean radical politics both in the metropole and abroad. I utilize the  writings of influential artists and intellectuals, the activities of West  Indian student groups, correspondence between migrants and allies in the  Caribbean, social science research, and literary culture to illustrate the ways  migrants reckoned with racialization in the capital and ushered in a generation  of political mobilization which worked for the civil rights of people of color  in Britain. Ultimately, the hostile environment in London shocked the  migrants out of their colonial island identities, and their collective trauma  then contributed to the making of a new post-colonial, metropolitan  identity. This process was borne out of migrants\u2019 racialized experiences  in London and their maintenance of networks of communication and association  with family and friends in the West Indies.

My dissertation is entitled \u2018\u201cSo That Tomorrow Would Be Better for  Us:\u2019 Developing French-Funded Catholic Schools in Dahomey and Senegal,  1946-1975.\u201d I analyze the rapid expansion of Catholic schools in a largely  Muslim and multi-religious West Africa from the post-World War II to the  postcolonial period. I draw on never before used sources from over twenty  official and unofficial archives in Benin, Senegal, Italy, and France, as well  as interviews conducted with over 60 former students. The moral, civic vision  of those affiliated with these schools influenced a key generation of schoolchildren,  many of whom carried this into their professional lives as public servants and  citizens of newly independent West African nations.

L  M   Jeppe Mulich      Jeppe  Mulich holds an MA in European Studies from Yale University and a BSc in  Political Science from the University of Copenhagen. His work lies in the  disciplinary intersection between history, sociology, and international  relations and focuses on theories of empire in global history, in particular  the constitutive qualities of imperial practices; trans-imperial networks and  regional integration; hierarchy and international orders; and globalization as  a historical phenomenon. At New York University he works with Lauren Benton and  his dissertation, examining inter-imperial relations in the colonial Caribbean,  is entitled \u201cIn a Sea of Empires: Networks and Crossings in the Leeward  Islands, 1783-1834.\u201d           Jeppe  has published in The Journal of Global History, co-authored a piece in a  forthcoming anthology on spatial history, and presented ongoing research at a  number of conferences, including the International Studies Association, the  Society of Early Americanists, and the Millennium Conference at the LSE.

N  O              Mairin Odle      I am a  Ph.D. candidate in Atlantic history, with particular interests in  cross-cultural encounters, race, gender, and histories of the body in early  America.           My  dissertation, \u201cStories Written on the Body: Cross-Cultural Markings in the  North American Atlantic, 1600-1830\u201d, examines the role of permanent body  modifications in early American conceptions of cultural difference and personal  identity. In my research, I investigate  how cross-cultural contact between Native American, European, and African  societies in 17th- and 18th-century North America could alter individuals\u2019  physical appearances in profound ways\u2014focusing on three types of marks:  scalping, tattooing, and branding. These marks were connected by their  painful origins, the physical intimacy their infliction demanded, and their  symbolic, storytelling power. Tracing the experiences of marked  individuals, as well as the stories told about them, I demonstrate how  contested ideas about the nature of human and societal difference\u2014which played  out in diplomacy as well as violent conflict, captivity, and  enslavement\u2014actually reshaped early American bodies. Those reshaped  bodies in turn, I argue, were key to establishing (or disrupting) the material  reality of such ideas, particularly those emerging in the eighteenth century  about permanent and racialized physical identity.            Currently a Mellon Dissertation  Fellow in History here at NYU, I have held fellowships at the McNeil Center for  Early American Studies, the Newberry Library, the John Carter Brown Library,  the American Antiquarian Society, and the Library Company of Philadelphia and  Historical Society of Pennsylvania. My  work has appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography , as  well as The Appendix and The Atlantic .               Alison K. Okuda      Alison  K. Okuda entered the doctoral program in African Diaspora History in 2009 and,  along the way, she was awarded a M.Phil. in History. Under the guidance of  Michael Gomez, she is currently writing her dissertation, entitled \u201cCaribbean  and African Exchanges: The Post-Colonial Transformation of Ghanaian Music,  Identity, and Social Structure.\u201d It questions the meaning of pan-Africanism for  individuals in Ghana and the Caribbean through a look at inter-community  relations in the music scenes of London and Accra during the mid-twentieth  century. Focusing on how these people experienced a variety of music and  cultures demonstrates that popular conceptions of pan-Africanism in Ghana were  expansive and included the African diaspora. Such an inclusive attitude subsequently  influenced Ghanaian policies and institutions during the process of nation  building. In addition to her research fields in African Diaspora, West African,  and cultural history, Alison has research and teaching interests in Caribbean,  African American, and migration studies.           Ms.  Okuda has been an active member of the history department through such  activities as the African/Diaspora Student Workshop, which she co-created, the  Graduate History Teaching Collaborative, which she also co-created and has  continued to serve on its organizing committee, and the Africa-Diaspora Forum,  a faculty-led program for which she is the current assistant. Recently, she has  taught such courses as \u201cAfrica: History and Culture\u201d at Concordia  University-Wisconsin and \u201cNarratives of Cultural Exchange in African Diaspora  History\u201d at NYU, as well as led discussions as a Teaching Assistant for  \u201cCultures and Contexts: Global Asia.\u201d Her commitment to teaching is further  supported by her publications in the history department-funded Graduate  Teaching Handbook and the journal Metropolitan  Archivist under the title, \u201cDual Uses of the Archives: Critical Moments in  Researching and Teaching\u201d (Summer 2013). Alison has also presented her work in  range of spaces, from the African/Diaspora Student Workshop to international  conferences convened by the Ghana Studies Association, the Association of  Caribbean Historians, and the Association for the Study of the Worldwide  African Diaspora.   P  Q  R            Gabriel de Avilez Rocha           Advisor:  Lauren Benton           I am a  PhD Candidate specializing in the legal and environmental history of the early  modern Iberian Atlantic. My interests include comparative colonial Americas,  slavery and capitalism, ethnohistory, and empires in world history. Other interests  involve political ecology, actor-network theory, and global intellectual  history.           My  dissertation, titled \u201cEmpires Made Flesh: Commons in the Macaronesian Atlantic,  1450-1600\u201d investigates the intersections between communal resource  arrangements and Iberian imperial escalation in the early modern Atlantic  world. It focuses on the Macaronesian archipelagos (the Azores, Madeira, the  Canaries, and Cape Verde) as crossroads between Iberia, Northern Europe, the  African Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Americas. I study instances of  conflict and cooperation over extractive industries related to lumber,  minerals, plants, water, fish, and animals, alongside contemporaneous  initiatives of slaving, plunder, and colonization. Through local and regional  developments, I seek to understand how individuals and collectives from diverse  social and ethnic backgrounds sought profit and sustenance in the early modern  Atlantic.

Concentrating on civic education curricula, pedagogic techniques, and   literacy campaigns, my work explores how different regimes aimed at   forming citizens for specific conceptions of society and polity. The   narrative is based on a combination of archival research and personal   accounts accessed through oral histories from over seventy interviews   conducted with former students, teachers, professors, inspectors,   literacy educators, political activists, and government   officials--including the two most important ministers of education of   the 1976-1983 dictatorship. In this way, my dissertation assesses how a   number of people, with varying degrees of political commitment ranging   from armed training to relative apathy, lived through turbulent times,   responded to various political projects, and worked to influence   political outcomes.

Her dissertation, \u201cA  Trade of Their Own: Market Women, Insurgent Economies, and the Making of Caribbean  Freedom, 1800-1888,\u201d examines the economic practices of enslaved and free black  women in the context of the nineteenth century transition from slavery to  freedom. This work traces the development of the economies of the enslaved from  the marketing of surplus produce from individual and family provision grounds  to the feeding of entire colonies and the formation of plebian transimperial  trading networks in the Caribbean basin. \u2018A Trade of Their Own\u2019 argues that though  this informal economy subsidized slave society by reducing the costs of social  reproduction, the female-centered markets of Atlantic world were also multi-faceted  institutions that fostered an ethos of black autonomy conducive to rebellion and  antagonistic to the worst aspects of slavery\u2019s exploitation .

Research Fields: A frica, African Diaspora, Urban  History, Historical Cartography, Digital Humanities.           \u201cLagoon City: Lagos in the Nineteenth Century Bight of  Benin\u201d is a spatial history of Lagos between 1845 and 1868, one that takes into  account Lagos\u2019 role as the economic, political and cultural focal point of the  region. My research is rooted in urban history, but offers an interdisciplinary  response to analyzing the ways that coastal West Africans imagined, manipulated  and represented their cities. By analyzing myths of origin, songs, missionary  journals, newspapers, naval dispatches and reports, in tandem with the colonial  maps, sketches and surveys that fix and plot their ideas and activities, I  create maps paired with textual narratives to reconstruct their past in place.

Covering the period from the arrival of the SS Windrush from Jamaica in  1948 to Member of Parliament Enoch Powell\u2019s infamous \u201cRivers of Blood\u201d speech  in 1968, this project situates the development of networks of communication and  Caribbean radical politics both in the metropole and abroad. I utilize the  writings of influential artists and intellectuals, the activities of West  Indian student groups, correspondence between migrants and allies in the  Caribbean, social science research, and literary culture to illustrate the ways  migrants reckoned with racialization in the capital and ushered in a generation  of political mobilization which worked for the civil rights of people of color  in Britain. Ultimately, the hostile environment in London shocked the  migrants out of their colonial island identities, and their collective trauma  then contributed to the making of a new post-colonial, metropolitan  identity. This process was borne out of migrants\u2019 racialized experiences  in London and their maintenance of networks of communication and association  with family and friends in the West Indies.

I  J  K        Rachel Kantrowitz      Advisor:  Frederick Cooper           I am a  specialist in the history of twentieth century Francophone West Africa, with  thematic interests in international development, decolonization, religion, and  education. My dissertation is entitled \u2018\u201cSo That Tomorrow Would Be Better for  Us:\u2019 Developing French-Funded Catholic Schools in Dahomey and Senegal,  1946-1975.\u201d I analyze the rapid expansion of Catholic schools in a largely  Muslim and multi-religious West Africa from the post-World War II to the  postcolonial period. I draw on never before used sources from over twenty  official and unofficial archives in Benin, Senegal, Italy, and France, as well  as interviews conducted with over 60 former students. The moral, civic vision  of those affiliated with these schools influenced a key generation of schoolchildren,  many of whom carried this into their professional lives as public servants and  citizens of newly independent West African nations.

L  M   Jeppe Mulich      Jeppe  Mulich holds an MA in European Studies from Yale University and a BSc in  Political Science from the University of Copenhagen. His work lies in the  disciplinary intersection between history, sociology, and international  relations and focuses on theories of empire in global history, in particular  the constitutive qualities of imperial practices; trans-imperial networks and  regional integration; hierarchy and international orders; and globalization as  a historical phenomenon. At New York University he works with Lauren Benton and  his dissertation, examining inter-imperial relations in the colonial Caribbean,  is entitled \u201cIn a Sea of Empires: Networks and Crossings in the Leeward  Islands, 1783-1834.\u201d           Jeppe  has published in The Journal of Global History, co-authored a piece in a  forthcoming anthology on spatial history, and presented ongoing research at a  number of conferences, including the International Studies Association, the  Society of Early Americanists, and the Millennium Conference at the LSE. Before  embarking upon his doctoral studies, he worked on political affairs at the  Permanent Mission of Denmark to the United Nations in New York.  N  O              Mairin Odle      I am a  Ph.D. candidate in Atlantic history, with particular interests in  cross-cultural encounters, race, gender, and histories of the body in early  America.           My  dissertation, \u201cStories Written on the Body: Cross-Cultural Markings in the  North American Atlantic, 1600-1830\u201d, examines the role of permanent body  modifications in early American conceptions of cultural difference and personal  identity. In my research, I investigate  how cross-cultural contact between Native American, European, and African  societies in 17th- and 18th-century North America could alter individuals\u2019  physical appearances in profound ways\u2014focusing on three types of marks:  scalping, tattooing, and branding. These marks were connected by their  painful origins, the physical intimacy their infliction demanded, and their  symbolic, storytelling power. Tracing the experiences of marked  individuals, as well as the stories told about them, I demonstrate how  contested ideas about the nature of human and societal difference\u2014which played  out in diplomacy as well as violent conflict, captivity, and  enslavement\u2014actually reshaped early American bodies. Those reshaped  bodies in turn, I argue, were key to establishing (or disrupting) the material  reality of such ideas, particularly those emerging in the eighteenth century  about permanent and racialized physical identity.            Currently a Mellon Dissertation  Fellow in History here at NYU, I have held fellowships at the McNeil Center for  Early American Studies, the Newberry Library, the John Carter Brown Library,  the American Antiquarian Society, and the Library Company of Philadelphia and  Historical Society of Pennsylvania. My  work has appeared in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography , as  well as The Appendix and The Atlantic .               Alison K. Okuda      Alison  K. Okuda entered the doctoral program in African Diaspora History in 2009 and,  along the way, she was awarded a M.Phil. in History. Under the guidance of  Michael Gomez, she is currently writing her dissertation, entitled \u201cCaribbean  and African Exchanges: The Post-Colonial Transformation of Ghanaian Music,  Identity, and Social Structure.\u201d It questions the meaning of pan-Africanism for  individuals in Ghana and the Caribbean through a look at inter-community  relations in the music scenes of London and Accra during the mid-twentieth  century. Focusing on how these people experienced a variety of music and  cultures demonstrates that popular conceptions of pan-Africanism in Ghana were  expansive and included the African diaspora. Such an inclusive attitude subsequently  influenced Ghanaian policies and institutions during the process of nation  building. In addition to her research fields in African Diaspora, West African,  and cultural history, Alison has research and teaching interests in Caribbean,  African American, and migration studies.           Ms.  Okuda has been an active member of the history department through such  activities as the African/Diaspora Student Workshop, which she co-created, the  Graduate History Teaching Collaborative, which she also co-created and has  continued to serve on its organizing committee, and the Africa-Diaspora Forum,  a faculty-led program for which she is the current assistant. Recently, she has  taught such courses as \u201cAfrica: History and Culture\u201d at Concordia  University-Wisconsin and \u201cNarratives of Cultural Exchange in African Diaspora  History\u201d at NYU, as well as led discussions as a Teaching Assistant for  \u201cCultures and Contexts: Global Asia.\u201d Her commitment to teaching is further  supported by her publications in the history department-funded Graduate  Teaching Handbook and the journal Metropolitan  Archivist under the title, \u201cDual Uses of the Archives: Critical Moments in  Researching and Teaching\u201d (Summer 2013). Alison has also presented her work in  range of spaces, from the African/Diaspora Student Workshop to international  conferences convened by the Ghana Studies Association, the Association of  Caribbean Historians, and the Association for the Study of the Worldwide  African Diaspora.   P  Q  R            Gabriel de Avilez Rocha           Advisor:  Lauren Benton           I am a  PhD Candidate specializing in the legal and environmental history of the early  modern Iberian Atlantic. My interests include comparative colonial Americas,  slavery and capitalism, ethnohistory, and empires in world history. Other interests  involve political ecology, actor-network theory, and global intellectual  history.           My  dissertation, titled \u201cEmpires Made Flesh: Commons in the Macaronesian Atlantic,  1450-1600\u201d investigates the intersections between communal resource  arrangements and Iberian imperial escalation in the early modern Atlantic  world. It focuses on the Macaronesian archipelagos (the Azores, Madeira, the  Canaries, and Cape Verde) as crossroads between Iberia, Northern Europe, the  African Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Americas. I study instances of  conflict and cooperation over extractive industries related to lumber,  minerals, plants, water, fish, and animals, alongside contemporaneous  initiatives of slaving, plunder, and colonization. Through local and regional  developments, I seek to understand how individuals and collectives from diverse  social and ethnic backgrounds sought profit and sustenance in the early modern  Atlantic.

Federico Sor      Areas of teaching interests: modern Latin America and the Caribbean, colonial Latin America, modern global history  Research interests: Latin America, political history, social history, Cold War, national narratives  Courses taught: \"A History of Capitalism,\" \"Contemporary World: An Introduction to Global History Since 1800\"  Dissertation: \"The Pedagogy of Revolution and Counterrevolution in Argentina, 1966-1983\" My   dissertation is a study of competing political ideologies and projects   in Cold War Argentina, focusing on education as a site where those   ideologies and projects are expressed with particular clarity.   Concentrating on civic education curricula, pedagogic techniques, and   literacy campaigns, my work explores how different regimes aimed at   forming citizens for specific conceptions of society and polity. The   narrative is based on a combination of archival research and personal   accounts accessed through oral histories from over seventy interviews   conducted with former students, teachers, professors, inspectors,   literacy educators, political activists, and government   officials--including the two most important ministers of education of   the 1976-1983 dictatorship. In this way, my dissertation assesses how a   number of people, with varying degrees of political commitment ranging   from armed training to relative apathy, lived through turbulent times,   responded to various political projects, and worked to influence   political outcomes.

Her dissertation, \u201cA  Trade of Their Own: Market Women, Insurgent Economies, and the Making of Caribbean  Freedom, 1800-1888,\u201d examines the economic practices of enslaved and free black  women in the context of the nineteenth century transition from slavery to  freedom. This work traces the development of the economies of the enslaved from  the marketing of surplus produce from individual and family provision grounds  to the feeding of entire colonies and the formation of plebian transimperial  trading networks in the Caribbean basin. \u2018A Trade of Their Own\u2019 argues that though  this informal economy subsidized slave society by reducing the costs of social  reproduction, the female-centered markets of Atlantic world were also multi-faceted  institutions that fostered an ethos of black autonomy conducive to rebellion and  antagonistic to the worst aspects of slavery\u2019s exploitation .          Shauna has taught history courses on Africa, global Asia,  Latin America and the Caribbean, and the black Atlantic.

Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues  pertaining to Africana studies and take a corequisite seminar that  enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic  terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow  students to apply the theory that they have gained through course  work, (2) to provide students with analytical tools, and (3) to  assist students in their exploration of professional career paths.  The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an  interview and permission of the director of internships.      Independent Study        Independent Study SCA-UA 197, 198 Prerequisite:  permission of the program director. Offered every semester. 1 to 4  points per term.      Elective Courses          Black Urban Studies SCA-UA 115 Formerly SCA-UA 105.  Identical to HIST-UA 90. Offered every year. 4 points. Introduces students to the tools of  cultural criticism and theory, with particular emphasis on black  culture, urban environment, and black people\u2019s relationships to a  variety of social and cultural institutions and practices. The latter  may include the mass media, class and poverty, the police, urban  development, education, music, art, and sports.          African American 20th-Century Novels  and Narratives SCA-UA 139 Offered every year. 4  points. This seminar covers a historicized  selection of black writers who over the latter half of the 20th  century have inscribed in literature the cultural, social, and  political experiences of African Americans in the United States. We  critically explore, discuss, and write about a range of works varying  from poetry to the short story and the novel. Our studies focus on  the key topics, issues, innovations, and themes that have  consistently been important to African American literary production.  Some examples are the emancipation impulse, \u201cdouble consciousness,\u201d  the black struggle for human rights, the rise of black women writers,  postmodernism, sexual and gender politics, and contemporary  expressions of the slavery motif.          The Black Essay SCA-UA 152 Offered every year. 4  points. Examines the urban experience and black  life and culture in New York through a series of writing assignments  on African American neighborhoods, institutions, issues, and culture.  Students are required to travel throughout the black community,  conduct interviews, and do research for essays on the black  experience in the city. They are introduced to the research and  reporting techniques of journalism and given the chance to employ  these techniques in their papers.          The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 Offered every year. 4  points. This interdisciplinary seminar explores  the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in  addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Central  to our discussions is a focus on how the display of the black body  affects how we see and interpret the world. Using a series of case  studies, we consider the construction of beauty, gendered images,  race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze has profoundly  determined the visual construction of the black body in contemporary  society. The interplay between the historical and the contemporary,  between self-presentation and imposed representation, is fundamental  to our discussions. The seminar centers the student within the  contemporary world of image making with an emphasis on the black  body. Final projects include an imaging project and/or a written  essay.          Black Feminism SCA-UA 156 Offered once every two  years. 4 points. This course explores the production and  practice of black feminist theory in 20th-century America. We examine  the written work and the activism of African American women and look  at the way that theory and practice historically intersect around  questions of race and gender. Because this is a course on feminism,  we also spend a good deal of time interrogating power and thinking  about the ways in which systems of oppression both produce and block  a black feminist consciousness. Hip Hop &amp; Politics SCA-UA 157 Offered every year. 4 points. In places ranging from the political theory of Adolph Reed to the comedy of Bill Cosby we find a critique of the \"hip hop generation\" so dismissive it might be a useful point of departure for further historical and theoretical inquiry. Besides realizing the worst fears of a previous generation who placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, this new generation's fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race. This course mixes a diverse set of readings with music and film to interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \"hip-hop generation\" and the perceived demise of contemporary black politics. Race and Reproduction SCA-UA 158 Offered every other year. 4 points. Race and Reproduction is an interdisciplinary course that examines the connections between gender, racial ideology and history of medicine to consider the range of ways that reproduction\u2014medically, culturally, and experientially\u2014produces and troubles racial ideology. In this course we will explore issues in the history of race and reproduction, focusing primarily (though not exclusively) on North American contexts. Cross-cultural breadth will help us to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and socio-cultural context. While questions about biology will be central to this history, we will also locate biology within a wider set of issues around social reproduction and the practices of motherhood. Through our readings we will consider how different disciplinary orientations (social history, medical anthropology, feminist theory, art history, etc.) help us to illuminate and problematize the connections between technologies and politics of biology and difference.             Language and Liberation: At Home in the  Caribbean and Abroad SCA-UA 163 Identical to LING-UA 26.  Offered every year. 4 points. Explores the linguistic and cultural  transformations that took place in the Commonwealth Caribbean from  17th-century slavery and bond servitude to the present day. The focus  is on the extent to which Caribbean people were given or demanded the  freedom to create and maintain a postcolonial Caribbean identity.  Discusses the sociohistorical conditions that led to the creation of  new Caribbean languages called \u201cpidgins\u201d and \u201ccreoles\u201d as the  English language was transplanted from Britain to the Third World.          The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 Offered once every year. 4  points. Cities have played an important role  throughout African history and in various Afrodiasporic contexts:  from the metropolises of ancient Egypt and the urban centers of  well-known West African civilizations (such as Ghana, Mali, and  Songhai) to cities such as Port-au-Prince, Havana, and Georgetown in  the Caribbean and the urban enclaves in the United States. In  attending to the way actors constitute wealth and power\u2014in  accounting for the way proximity structures interpersonal  experiences\u2014this course uses ethnographic, sociological,  historical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city. We  explore the contours of these urban matrices through special  attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the  way Afrodiasporic populations have experienced and lived history  (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). As part  of our mission, we consider the historical emergence of the Third  World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian  postcolonies, but instead, a project to reverse the course of  European exploitation. Instead of proceeding strictly  chronologically, students consider the Afrodiasporic urban experience  thematically, through a diverse array of readings.          Topics in Africana Studies SCA-UA 180 Offered once a semester. 4  points. Explores specific issues dealing with  the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural  institutions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester,  include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education,  sports, music, and art.          Topics in Pan-Africanism SCA-UA 181 Offered once a semester. 4  points. Deals with specific themes of  Pan-Africanism and their impact on the modern world. Possible themes,  which vary from semester to semester, include African unity, black  rebellion, colonialism and racism, the African diaspora and culture,  and relationships between Pan-Africanism and movements such as  nationalism, Marxism, and Afrocentricity.      Language Courses          Elementary Swahili I SCA-UA 121 Offered every year. 4  points. Provides students with an elementary  understanding of Swahili, a Bantu language with a rich oral and  written tradition that is spoken by about 100 million people from  Somalia to Mozambique and Zanzibar. After a short presentation of  Swahili\u2019s history, codification, and relation to other languages,  students are drilled in phonetics and grammar. They are also  introduced to poems, songs, and oral narratives.          Elementary Swahili II SCA-UA 122 Prerequisite: Elementary  Swahili I (SCA-UA 121) or permission of the instructor. Offered every  year. 4 points. Expands on the basic knowledge of the  pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental  grammatical features acquired in Swahili I. Allows essential  communication skills to develop into conversational ability using  simple and familiar situations. Building on the early grasp of the  language, students expand the range of conversational ability and  understanding of various grammatical concepts associated with this  agglutinative language.          Intermediate Swahili I SCA-UA 123 Prerequisite: Elementary  Swahili II (SCA-UA 122) or permission of the instructor. Offered  every year. 4 points. Builds on the basic knowledge of the  pronunciation, vocabulary, useful expressions, and fundamental  grammatical features already attained at the introductory level. Aims  to strengthen reading, writing, and conversation skills by accessing  a wide range of grammatical and literary knowledge of the language,  its cultural context, and literary genre. Students are required to  familiarize themselves with a novel and a play written in Kiswahili.          Intermediate Swahili II SCA-UA 124 Prerequisite: Intermediate  Swahili I (SCA-UA 123) or permission of the instructor. Offered every  year. 4 points. Aims to enable students to communicate  entirely in Kiswahili, to carry out bidirectional translation from  Swahili to English and from English to Swahili, and to negotiate  technical language. At this level, students would master the  intricacies of Kiswahili grammar; acquire a wide range of vocabulary;  read Kiswahili fluently; understand Kiswahili poetry, idioms, and  proverbs; and use idiomatic Kiswahili in creative writing and  translation.
