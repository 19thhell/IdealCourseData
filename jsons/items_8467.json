Special emphasis is placed on visiting and exploring significant cultural and historical sites, not only in Athens but also in other parts of Greece. Field trips, cultural activities, and guest lecturers constitute an integral component of the program; students are expected to attend and actively participate in all of them.            ACADEMICS      NYU Summer in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, literature, politics, art, and culture of Greece with cultural activities and field trips to introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. Local artists, scholars, and politicians often give presentations and lectures in class. Approaching modern Hellenic society and culture from an interdisciplinary perspective, the program provides students with an appreciation of the history of modern Greek language and literature and an understanding of how the Greeks have borne their classical, Byzantine, and Ottoman historical and political experiences, even as they translate them into the modern era.      Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-story Bauhaus building conveniently located in the historical center of Athens. The center has several classrooms, study areas, a library, gallery space, screening rooms, patio, and recreation areas. The surrounding neighborhood is active, with many cafes, restaurants, cinemas, stores, and opportunities to enjoy one of the most vibrant cities in the world.

HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Students stay in double rooms at the five-star St. George Hotel, a modern, air-conditioned hotel situated in the fashionable Kolonaki district. The hotel\u2019s location, in a lively section of Athens, offers students the opportunity to enjoy a neighborhood rich in cultural diversions and leisure activities. Breakfast, linens, and a daily room cleaning service are provided. Hotel amenities include a roof garden with pool.            EXCURSIONS     The program's trips and excursions are under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Culture and are meant to encourage students to discover and experience modern Greece through the various lenses of its rich history. Activities may include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, evening outings to dramatic and musical performances, and a half-day trip to Attica's beautiful coastline and Poseidon's temple at Cape Sounion. Weekend trips may include the royal tombs of Mycenae, the ancient theatre of Epidaurus, the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the volcanic Cycladic island of Santorini. This year's program may also include a visit to the island of Crete, known not only for its historical and archaeological importance but also for its geophysical uniqueness and breathtaking beauty.      Excursions may also include the impressive medieval settlement of Mystras, the capital of Byzantine Greece, and the imposing Byzantine-Venetian fortified towns in mountainous Arcadia in the Peloponnese. There are also organized visits to significant sites of modern Greek history, including Nafplion, the capital of the Greek state after the 1821 War of Independence and a city known for its beautiful examples of 19th-century neoclassical architecture, as well as the Polytechnic School of Athens, site of the 1973 student uprising against the dictatorship. All these sites offer the unique opportunity for long walks, hiking, and exploration.              Undergraduate Courses     All undergraduate students must register for 8 points.

This course focuses primarily on selected plays of the three leading Athenian dramatists: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Plays are analyzed critically in relation to their cultural, historical, and theatrical importance. Situating the plays within the history of Greek drama, the course also assesses their continuing influence on 20th-century notions of performance. Students have the unique opportunity of attending performances of the plays by renowned theatre troupes in the ancient theatre of Herod Atticus in Athens and in that of Epidaurus.

Assuming that Athens serves as a window into Greek history and culture, this course provides students with an opportunity to encounter Greece through the architecture, monuments, art, and music of Athens. From its early beginnings as a center for art and literature, for commerce and industry, to its emergence as the capital of the new Greek state, Athens has always been a city in transition, a museum of Greek history as well as an active, living entity. It retains the traces of the political, economic, religious, and cultural history of Greece\u2014in its streets, its buildings, its glorious artifacts and ruins\u2014even as it struggles to move forward. Students are introduced to the beauty and history of a city whose identity is inextricably bound to mythology and to the history of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization. Visits to archaeological centers, museums, music bars, and several of the city's most important cultural and historical sites are included. A sample syllabus is available upon request by e-mailing summer.in.athens@nyu.edu                                                                  CLASS-UA 9352 \u0096\u00a0The Archaeology of Greece\u00a0\u0096- Staff - \u0096 4 points                               Conducted in English.  In the world's literary and intellectual imagination, Greece is a land of ruins and monuments. Conceptualizing and idealizing Greece's ancient past, archaeology has played a crucial role in the discursive and ideological formation of modern Greece and Neohellenism. In this course, students are introduced to several of Greece's most significant archaeological sites - sites that bear the traces of Greece's prehistoric era, its classical past, the Roman conquest, the Byzantine period, and beyond. The course seeks to assess the various ways in which contemporary Greece has borne the burden of its antiquity and how its &quot;past glories&quot; are inscribed in its present cultural life as a modern Mediterranean, Balkan, and European country located on the crossroads of the East and West. For this to be achieved, we will read stories of Greek travel from a host of writers. The course considers materials drawn not only from archaeology but also from anthropology, travel accounts, literature, and cultural geography. Field trips to archaeological sites and visits to museums are included. Through individual projects and written assignments, students are expected to develop their skills of observation and analysis, as well as pursue an in-depth &quot;reading&quot; not only of Greece's past, but also of present day Greece in all its complexity and richness.

Special emphasis is placed on visiting and exploring significant cultural and historical sites, not only in Athens but also in other parts of Greece. Field trips, cultural activities, and guest lecturers constitute an integral component of the program; students are expected to attend and actively participate in all of them.            ACADEMICS      NYU Summer in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, literature, politics, art, and culture of Greece with cultural activities and field trips to introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. Local artists, scholars, and politicians often give presentations and lectures in class. Approaching modern Hellenic society and culture from an interdisciplinary perspective, the program provides students with an appreciation of the history of modern Greek language and literature and an understanding of how the Greeks have borne their classical, Byzantine, and Ottoman historical and political experiences, even as they translate them into the modern era.      Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-story Bauhaus building conveniently located in the historical center of Athens. The center has several classrooms, study areas, a library, gallery space, screening rooms, patio, and recreation areas. The surrounding neighborhood is active, with many cafes, restaurants, cinemas, stores, and opportunities to enjoy one of the most vibrant cities in the world.

HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Students stay in double rooms at the five-star St. George Hotel, a modern, air-conditioned hotel situated in the fashionable Kolonaki district. The hotel\u2019s location, in a lively section of Athens, offers students the opportunity to enjoy a neighborhood rich in cultural diversions and leisure activities. Breakfast, linens, and a daily room cleaning service are provided. Hotel amenities include a roof garden with pool.            EXCURSIONS     The program's trips and excursions are under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Culture and are meant to encourage students to discover and experience modern Greece through the various lenses of its rich history. Activities may include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, evening outings to dramatic and musical performances, and a half-day trip to Attica's beautiful coastline and Poseidon's temple at Cape Sounion. Weekend trips may include the royal tombs of Mycenae, the ancient theatre of Epidaurus, the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the volcanic Cycladic island of Santorini. This year's program may also include a visit to the island of Crete, known not only for its historical and archaeological importance but also for its geophysical uniqueness and breathtaking beauty.      Excursions may also include the impressive medieval settlement of Mystras, the capital of Byzantine Greece, and the imposing Byzantine-Venetian fortified towns in mountainous Arcadia in the Peloponnese. There are also organized visits to significant sites of modern Greek history, including Nafplion, the capital of the Greek state after the 1821 War of Independence and a city known for its beautiful examples of 19th-century neoclassical architecture, as well as the Polytechnic School of Athens, site of the 1973 student uprising against the dictatorship. All these sites offer the unique opportunity for long walks, hiking, and exploration.              Undergraduate Courses     All undergraduate students must register for 8 points.

This course focuses primarily on selected plays of the three leading Athenian dramatists: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Plays are analyzed critically in relation to their cultural, historical, and theatrical importance. Situating the plays within the history of Greek drama, the course also assesses their continuing influence on 20th-century notions of performance. Students have the unique opportunity of attending performances of the plays by renowned theatre troupes in the ancient theatre of Herod Atticus in Athens and in that of Epidaurus.

Assuming that Athens serves as a window into Greek history and culture, this course provides students with an opportunity to encounter Greece through the architecture, monuments, art, and music of Athens. From its early beginnings as a center for art and literature, for commerce and industry, to its emergence as the capital of the new Greek state, Athens has always been a city in transition, a museum of Greek history as well as an active, living entity. It retains the traces of the political, economic, religious, and cultural history of Greece\u2014in its streets, its buildings, its glorious artifacts and ruins\u2014even as it struggles to move forward. Students are introduced to the beauty and history of a city whose identity is inextricably bound to mythology and to the history of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization. Visits to archaeological centers, museums, music bars, and several of the city's most important cultural and historical sites are included. A sample syllabus is available upon request by e-mailing summer.in.athens@nyu.edu                                                                  CLASS-UA 9352 \u0096\u00a0The Archaeology of Greece\u00a0\u0096- Staff - \u0096 4 points                               Conducted in English.  In the world's literary and intellectual imagination, Greece is a land of ruins and monuments. Conceptualizing and idealizing Greece's ancient past, archaeology has played a crucial role in the discursive and ideological formation of modern Greece and Neohellenism. In this course, students are introduced to several of Greece's most significant archaeological sites - sites that bear the traces of Greece's prehistoric era, its classical past, the Roman conquest, the Byzantine period, and beyond. The course seeks to assess the various ways in which contemporary Greece has borne the burden of its antiquity and how its &quot;past glories&quot; are inscribed in its present cultural life as a modern Mediterranean, Balkan, and European country located on the crossroads of the East and West. For this to be achieved, we will read stories of Greek travel from a host of writers. The course considers materials drawn not only from archaeology but also from anthropology, travel accounts, literature, and cultural geography. Field trips to archaeological sites and visits to museums are included. Through individual projects and written assignments, students are expected to develop their skills of observation and analysis, as well as pursue an in-depth &quot;reading&quot; not only of Greece's past, but also of present day Greece in all its complexity and richness.

Special emphasis is placed on visiting and exploring significant cultural and historical sites, not only in Athens but also in other parts of Greece. Field trips, cultural activities, and guest lecturers constitute an integral component of the program; students are expected to attend and actively participate in all of them.            ACADEMICS      NYU Summer in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, literature, politics, art, and culture of Greece with cultural activities and field trips to introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. Local artists, scholars, and politicians often give presentations and lectures in class. Approaching modern Hellenic society and culture from an interdisciplinary perspective, the program provides students with an appreciation of the history of modern Greek language and literature and an understanding of how the Greeks have borne their classical, Byzantine, and Ottoman historical and political experiences, even as they translate them into the modern era.      Classes are held at the Al Andar Center, a three-story Bauhaus building conveniently located in the historical center of Athens. The center has several classrooms, study areas, a library, gallery space, screening rooms, patio, and recreation areas. The surrounding neighborhood is active, with many cafes, restaurants, cinemas, stores, and opportunities to enjoy one of the most vibrant cities in the world.

HOUSING &amp; MEALS     All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Students stay in double rooms at the five-star St. George Hotel, a modern, air-conditioned hotel situated in the fashionable Kolonaki district. The hotel\u2019s location, in a lively section of Athens, offers students the opportunity to enjoy a neighborhood rich in cultural diversions and leisure activities. Breakfast, linens, and a daily room cleaning service are provided. Hotel amenities include a roof garden with pool.            EXCURSIONS     The program's trips and excursions are under the auspices of the Greek Ministry of Culture and are meant to encourage students to discover and experience modern Greece through the various lenses of its rich history. Activities may include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, evening outings to dramatic and musical performances, and a half-day trip to Attica's beautiful coastline and Poseidon's temple at Cape Sounion. Weekend trips may include the royal tombs of Mycenae, the ancient theatre of Epidaurus, the oracle of Apollo at Delphi, Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, and the volcanic Cycladic island of Santorini. This year's program may also include a visit to the island of Crete, known not only for its historical and archaeological importance but also for its geophysical uniqueness and breathtaking beauty.      Excursions may also include the impressive medieval settlement of Mystras, the capital of Byzantine Greece, and the imposing Byzantine-Venetian fortified towns in mountainous Arcadia in the Peloponnese. There are also organized visits to significant sites of modern Greek history, including Nafplion, the capital of the Greek state after the 1821 War of Independence and a city known for its beautiful examples of 19th-century neoclassical architecture, as well as the Polytechnic School of Athens, site of the 1973 student uprising against the dictatorship. All these sites offer the unique opportunity for long walks, hiking, and exploration.

This course focuses primarily on selected plays of the three leading Athenian dramatists: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Plays are analyzed critically in relation to their cultural, historical, and theatrical importance. Situating the plays within the history of Greek drama, the course also assesses their continuing influence on 20th-century notions of performance. Students have the unique opportunity of attending performances of the plays by renowned theatre troupes in the ancient theatre of Herod Atticus in Athens and in that of Epidaurus. A sample syllabus is available upon request by e-mailing summer.in.athens@nyu.edu                                                              HEL-UA 9130 \u0096\u00a0The City of Athens \u0096- Theodoratou -\u0096 4 points                               Conducted in English.  Assuming that Athens serves as a window into Greek history and culture, this course provides students with an opportunity to encounter Greece through the architecture, monuments, art, and music of Athens. From its early beginnings as a center for art and literature, for commerce and industry, to its emergence as the capital of the new Greek state, Athens has always been a city in transition, a museum of Greek history as well as an active, living entity. It retains the traces of the political, economic, religious, and cultural history of Greece\u2014in its streets, its buildings, its glorious artifacts and ruins\u2014even as it struggles to move forward. Students are introduced to the beauty and history of a city whose identity is inextricably bound to mythology and to the history of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization. Visits to archaeological centers, museums, music bars, and several of the city's most important cultural and historical sites are included. A sample syllabus is available upon request by e-mailing summer.in.athens@nyu.edu                                                                  CLASS-UA 9352 \u0096\u00a0The Archaeology of Greece\u00a0\u0096- Staff - \u0096 4 points                               Conducted in English.  In the world's literary and intellectual imagination, Greece is a land of ruins and monuments. Conceptualizing and idealizing Greece's ancient past, archaeology has played a crucial role in the discursive and ideological formation of modern Greece and Neohellenism. In this course, students are introduced to several of Greece's most significant archaeological sites - sites that bear the traces of Greece's prehistoric era, its classical past, the Roman conquest, the Byzantine period, and beyond. The course seeks to assess the various ways in which contemporary Greece has borne the burden of its antiquity and how its &quot;past glories&quot; are inscribed in its present cultural life as a modern Mediterranean, Balkan, and European country located on the crossroads of the East and West. For this to be achieved, we will read stories of Greek travel from a host of writers. The course considers materials drawn not only from archaeology but also from anthropology, travel accounts, literature, and cultural geography. Field trips to archaeological sites and visits to museums are included. Through individual projects and written assignments, students are expected to develop their skills of observation and analysis, as well as pursue an in-depth &quot;reading&quot; not only of Greece's past, but also of present day Greece in all its complexity and richness.

This trip was a once in a lifetime experience, and words cannot describe how grateful I am for that.&quot;     &quot;What a wonderful time I've had here in Greece. This program is unlike any other I have experienced from the fantastic professors to the fun trips and excursions, and not to mention Liana's incredible enthusiasm.&quot;     &quot;This trip has been such an amazing experience for me. Not only have I learned so much about Greece and had the chance to see some of the art and architecture that I have studied about for so long but I have also made so many great friends since I've been here. I cannot tell you what these last six weeks have meant to me. I've enjoyed every second of my trip.&quot;   &quot;Most amazing summer of my life. The faculty and staff put so much effort into making this program so incredible.
