Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Health systems around the world are grappling with problems of cost, access, equity and quality of health care, and the tradeoffs among these objectives. Economic and political reforms designed to promote markets, manage competition, organize systems for public contracting, improve management, and change financial incentives in the health sector have been debated in most countries, and in many cases, implemented. While health system reform has received more attention than public health, there has also been increasing attention to what is often termed the \u201cnew public health.\u201d As reforms to improve population health have been added to the political agenda, there have been new efforts to rekindle health reform.      In this seminar, we will apply some perspectives and tools of public policy analysis, and draw on international comparisons of health systems to analyze efforts at health system and public health reform. The readings, lectures and class discussions should make students more knowledgeable about policy options and policy changes in different countries. The seminar opens with an overview of how forces of \u201cglobalization\u201d may affect health system reform. Next, we focus on ideas, concepts and theories of health care reform. We then attempt to go beyond the OECD and controversial WHO approach to health system performance and examine what may be learned in the United States from health systems and reform efforts in wealthy industrialized nations. The course provides a special focus on the experience of Britain, Germany and France. Each case will apply a common, general framework for analyzing health systems and reform while emphasizing different perspectives for approaching these topics. Students are required to select a wealthy OECD nation and become \u201cexperts\u201d about the health system and efforts to reform it.

Semester: Fall       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Only open to Executive MPA students.      This course exposes students to contemporary thinking about institutions, governance and the reinvention of the public sector. We focus on specific reforms intended to improve government performance and promote good governance as rapid economic, political and social changes-both global and local-- evolve in different countries at various stages of development. Major topics include establishing and enhancing rule of law, property rights, and regulatory regimes; developing more effective organizational structures, civil service systems and anti-corruption mechanisms; and creating and enhancing frameworks and policies for public sector fiscal management, decentralization, public-private partnership and citizen engagement. As we work through the topics, we consider competing theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence. An underlying theme is the need to go beyond the mainstream tendency to use pre-packaged tools and narrow frameworks in pursuit of single \"right\" answers. Rather, the course uses diverse case material to challenges students to use rigorous and creative analysis to seek levers of change that matter and are feasible in particular contexts.
