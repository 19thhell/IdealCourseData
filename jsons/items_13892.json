(The Investment Office does not manage the  University\u2019s real estate holdings, retirement plan assets, charitable giving vehicles, or  other gifts which have certain investment restrictions.)   NYU\u2019s Endowment Fund provides a permanent source of capital and support to the  University\u2019s mission and programs. The portfolio is managed by professional investment  staff (the NYU Investment Office) and utilizes a broadly diversified roster of external  managers.   The Fund seeks to maximize a long-term real rate of return commensurate with the risks  appropriate to an investment portfolio that maintains a total-return investment philosophy,  a generation-neutral spending policy and an infinite investment horizon. Active  management and diversification are fundamental elements of NYU\u2019s investment  approach which seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted performance to that available  solely through passive indices.

(The Investment Office does not manage the  University\u2019s real estate holdings, retirement plan assets, charitable giving vehicles, or  other gifts which have certain investment restrictions.)   NYU\u2019s Endowment Fund provides a permanent source of capital and support to the  University\u2019s mission and programs. The portfolio is managed by professional investment  staff (the NYU Investment Office) and utilizes a broadly diversified roster of external  managers.   The Fund seeks to maximize a long-term real rate of return commensurate with the risks  appropriate to an investment portfolio that maintains a total-return investment philosophy,  a generation-neutral spending policy and an infinite investment horizon. Active  management and diversification are fundamental elements of NYU\u2019s investment  approach which seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted performance to that available  solely through passive indices.
