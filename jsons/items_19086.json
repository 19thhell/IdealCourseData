New York Senator Martin J. Golden (District 22), chair of the Senate Select Committee on Science, Technology, Incubation and Entrepreneurship, and NYU-Poly organized the fact-finding session so that government representatives of New York City, the Governor\u2019s Office, and the Senate can hear from 25 of the most prominent leaders in the sector during two panel discussions on Friday, September 20, 2013.     The roundtable, entitled \u201cGrowing Computer and Video Game Development in New York,\u201d will offer opportunities for the public to question panelists and make suggestions on how to attract and support an industry that accounted for $4.9 billion of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2009. Speakers will explore whether and how New York can grow its digital games industry to match or exceed the size of its film industry.     Other statics from the Entertainment Software Association illustrate the impact of the sector:     \u2022 New York is among the top five states in industry employment: 5,474 direct and indirect jobs.  \u2022 The average compensation for an entertainment software industry employee in New York was$96,062.  \u2022 From 2005 to 2009, the entertainment software industry\u2019s annual growth exceeded 10 percent, compared to 2 percent growth for the entire U.S. economy.     \u201cThe gaming software industry is large and growing and New York State can claim an increasing share for our citizens,\u201d Golden said. \u201cAt present, New York State lags behind California, Texas, and Washington in the number of companies, employees, and contribution to the economy. We have about one-tenth the number of game software employees as California and one tenth of California\u2019s gaming software\u2019s contribution of $2.16 billion to the state economy. Even Texas has twice the economic impact and twice the number of employees of New York. Clearly we can do better. We have the talent and we have the people. The purpose of these Roundtables is to create policy and program that will make us the center of the game software universe. When companies and gaming entrepreneurs think of gaming software, we want them to think of New York State. We are taking our first steps to make that happen with this Roundtable.\u201d    \u201cNYU and NYU-Poly have emerged among the top universities in the country in game design, and this autumn we brought together all our graduate programs in Brooklyn\u2019s MetroTech Center under the Media and Games Network (MAGNET) to provide offices, studio and work spaces, teaching labs, and research areas,\u201d said Katepalli R.

Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. Our main result is that some well known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice-versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, we show it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push similar users toward the same products. We show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences.
