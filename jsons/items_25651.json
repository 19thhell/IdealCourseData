You fill notebooks with your plans for video game levels you\u2019d like to make. Or you spend entire weekends role-playing goofy adventures with your friends.   You run an online blog where you analyze the latest and greatest game releases. Or perhaps you just can\u2019t stop doodling your favorite video game characters.   You dominate your local card game tournament. Or maybe you just invent card games of your own.   We\u2019ve got news for you: You finally found what you\u2019re looking for.

If this is crazy, who wants to be sane?      What is the Game Center BFA?   The Game Design BFA is a 4-year Bachelors of Fine Arts program. We are located inside NYU\u2019s famous Tisch School of the Arts program, and like other Tisch programs in film, dance, and theater, we look at games as a creative form of art. Students in the BFA program learn about game design, game development, and game scholarship, preparing them for careers as game designers, developers, scholars, and critics.   The program structure first introduces you to the fundamentals of games through the lenses of design, technology, and culture. As you progress in the program, you have the flexibility to discover and pursue your own interests, taking courses that range from collaborative game production to critical analysis to specialized elements of visual and audio design. At the conclusion of your BFA study, you\u00a0complete a senior project, either as an individual or with a group.     A solid foundation. The required elements of the BFA curriculum covers the basics of making and understanding games on and off the computer. This includes courses like Games 101 , an in-depth look at the history of games from ancient board games to the latest videogames, taught by our entire faculty .       Broad and deep. The program emphasizes flexibility and choice. You can choose to focus in many areas, from game design to visual design, and from game programming to game scholarship. There are a wide array of classes from which you can mix and match your own education in games.       Senior project. All students complete a senior project \u2013 a one or two semester group or solo\u00a0endeavor. A capstone project might be making a game on or off the computer, or could be a research paper, curated exhibition , or take any number of other forms.       Integrated with the Game Center. The best thing about the Game Center BFA is that it is part of the larger NYU Game Center. Our faculty, staff, talks, workshops, resources, facilities, and events help make the program a world-class experience in the study of games.

The BFA Experience at NYU                                           Game Design BFA     You are not crazy.   You love games. You fill notebooks with your plans for video game levels you\u2019d like to make. Or you spend entire weekends role-playing goofy adventures with your friends.   You run an online blog where you analyze the latest and greatest game releases. Or perhaps you just can\u2019t stop doodling your favorite video game characters.   You dominate your local card game tournament. Or maybe you just invent card games of your own.   We\u2019ve got news for you: You finally found what you\u2019re looking for. At the NYU Game Center, we take games seriously. As seriously as you do. We know they are strange and amazing and magical. And we live to understand them better and invent new forms of play. We\u2019d like you to join us.   Your time in the NYU Game Center BFA will be challenging, frustrating, rewarding, and unforgettable. One thing\u2019s for sure: it will definitely be fun. If this is crazy, who wants to be sane?      What is the Game Center BFA?   The Game Design BFA is a 4-year Bachelors of Fine Arts program. We are located inside NYU\u2019s famous Tisch School of the Arts program, and like other Tisch programs in film, dance, and theater, we look at games as a creative form of art. Students in the BFA program learn about game design, game development, and game scholarship, preparing them for careers as game designers, developers, scholars, and critics.   The program structure first introduces you to the fundamentals of games through the lenses of design, technology, and culture. As you progress in the program, you have the flexibility to discover and pursue your own interests, taking courses that range from collaborative game production to critical analysis to specialized elements of visual and audio design. At the conclusion of your BFA study, you\u00a0complete a senior project, either as an individual or with a group.     A solid foundation. The required elements of the BFA curriculum covers the basics of making and understanding games on and off the computer. This includes courses like Games 101 , an in-depth look at the history of games from ancient board games to the latest videogames, taught by our entire faculty .       Broad and deep. The program emphasizes flexibility and choice. You can choose to focus in many areas, from game design to visual design, and from game programming to game scholarship. There are a wide array of classes from which you can mix and match your own education in games.       Senior project. All students complete a senior project \u2013 a one or two semester group or solo\u00a0endeavor. A capstone project might be making a game on or off the computer, or could be a research paper, curated exhibition , or take any number of other forms.       Integrated with the Game Center. The best thing about the Game Center BFA is that it is part of the larger NYU Game Center. Our faculty, staff, talks, workshops, resources, facilities, and events help make the program a world-class experience in the study of games.          Program Curriculum   The BFA in Game Design is a well-rounded, interdisciplinary degree that includes\u00a0 coursework \u00a0in game studies, game design and game development, as well as the option to specialize in game programming, visual or audio design, and the business of games. All of the courses in the Game Design BFA program are organized in seven areas. Each area represents one facet of the complex interdisciplinary endeavor of making and studying games.   Primary Areas   Game Studies \u2013 Academic, scholarly, and journalistic approaches to games  Game Design \u2013 Creating the rules of the game and the player experience  Game Development \u2013 Production processes for creating games   Production Areas   Programming \u2013 Interaction, graphics, AI, and other game programming  Visual Design \u2013 2D and 3D animation, graphic design, and art direction  Audio Design \u2013 Music, sound effects, and audio programming  Game Business \u2013 Marketing, revenue models, and the game industry   Capstone   During the final year, in addition to other advanced-level courses, each student will complete a senior capstone project.

All Game Design students must complete minimum of 44 credits in a combination of expository writing, humanities, and social or hard sciences.      Who should apply?   Some of our applicants come with experience in making their own games, but you don\u2019t have to be a life-long\u00a0gamer or a programmer in order to apply! The most important thing you need for the BFA program is a passion for games and the dedication to turn that passion into something real. It takes all kinds of people with a diversity of talents to make games, and we strive for a rich mix in terms of culture, gender, and background.   To apply to the BFA in Game Design, you will need to apply to New York University . You will also be sending in a portfolio for us to review. Your portfolio can be anything you want, as long as it shows off your creativity for games. It could be a film you made or a story you wrote. It could be the rules for a card game or a prototype computer game. Or perhaps an essay or blog post you wrote that helps us understand why you love games.   More information about the application process and the portfolio can be found here .

As the Director of the NYU Game Center, I probably shouldn\u2019t say that. But it\u2019s true. We learn by doing. Great games happen because creative people find their voices and express themselves to the world.   The Game Center MFA is the place where that happens.\u00a0We are game designers, theorists, storytellers, artists, hackers, musicians, visual designers, curators, educators, entrepreneurs, and much more.   We live in a time in which games are evolving in radical and important ways. Our students and faculty are defining the cultural landscape for the next hundred years.   Come join us.   Frank Lantz  Director, NYU Game Center                 What is the Game Center MFA?   The NYU Game Center MFA is a 2-year Master of Fine Arts degree in Game Design. Located within NYU\u2019s famous Tisch School of the Arts, we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with other forms of art, media, and culture. Our students study the design and development of games in a context of advanced critical literacy, with the goal of becoming game designers and developers, artists and curators, critics and scholars.   Our curriculum includes classes in the following areas:     Game Design &#8211; the fundamentals of how games work and how to create meaningful interactive experiences on and off the computer   Game Production &#8211; oriented towards the creation of digital games, such as our Code Lab series of game programming courses   Game Studies &#8211; critical theory and scholarship around the idea of games as a form of designed human culture   Game History &#8211; including our foundational Games 101 class , which traces the history of games from ancient boardgames to today\u2019s videogames   Studio Courses &#8211; where the emphasis is on the collaborative group creation of digital games   Thesis &#8211; focus of the program\u2019s second year, where you work alone or in groups on a project of your choosing   Play Labs &#8211; classes that take a deeper dive into the play of a particular game genre or designer\u2019s work &#8211; such as indie tabletop RPGs or tournament Starcraft play   Electives &#8211; a wide range of classes that explore everything from Game Journalism to Games and Players (a class on the psychology and emotions of game play)     And don\u2019t forget the rest of NYU! Our highly flexible structure means that students can take classes from any department or program across New York University. Our MFA students have studied interactive design at NYU\u2019s famous ITP design program , crafted stories with screenwriters in NYU\u2019s world-class film program, and hacked into hardware at NYU\u2019s new School of Engineering.   Browse the NYU Game Center course offerings here.      Your guide to the MFA   Every student that is accepted into the program gets a copy of the NYU Game Center Student Guidebook. You can download it here \u00a0and it\u2019s a great introduction to the Game Center MFA program and culture.   If you want even more details, check out the Game Center MFA FAQ which has answers to all of your burning questions.   Structure &amp; Curriculum   The MFA curriculum takes students through a two-year journey where you closely study the theory and practice of games, learn new skills, and have many, many opportunities to create games. The program begins with a highly structured first semester, but quickly becomes more flexible so that you can design and define your own course of study.   SEMESTER ONE   The school year kicks off with our annual GAME CENTER BOOT CAMP, a week of socializing and intensive programming workshops immediately before school begins. Boot camp gets everyone comfortable with each other and with making games. Then the first semester begins. Every MFA student takes the same courses during their first term:     Game Design 1 &#8211; the fundamentals of creating meaningful choice, with an emphasis on designing non-digital tabletop and physical games   Game Studio 1 &#8211; individually and in groups, students create digital games and learn best practices for a successful creative process   Game Studies 1 &#8211; introduction to the scholarship of games and critical theoretical approaches to game design   Games 101 &#8211; a history class that spans ancient to contemporary games, with an emphasis on actually playing as many of the games as possible   Code Lab Zero &#8211; for students less experienced with programming, this optional mini-class serves as a programming support workshop for Game Studio 1 projects     SEMESTER TWO   After the highly structured first semester, things open up considerably in the second.
