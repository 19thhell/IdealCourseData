The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.          Computer Simulation   (FRSEM-UA 207; class #7071)   Instructor: Charles S. Peskin   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics      Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course, students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.     CHARLES S. PESKIN is Silver Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science. His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.        Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature       (FRSEM-UA 210; class #7072)   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.     FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.      The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America      (FRSEM-UA 218; class #7073)   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. (and several Thursdays in this time slot; see below)   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.       IMPORTANT: Please note amended meeting schedule for this course in the fall 2012 term. Students who are unable to accommodate both the Tuesday and Thursday classes should not register for the course.     Tuesday, September 4   Thursday, September 6   Tuesday, September 11   Thursday, September 20   Tuesday, October 2   Thursday, October 11   Tuesday, October 23   Tuesday, October 30   Tuesday, November 6   Tuesday, November 13   Tuesday, November 20    Last class: Tuesday, November 27     Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level.     JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.      First Amendment Freedom of Expression      (FRSEM-UA 235; class #7074)   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)    Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources who provide critical information for a story of national importance. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the sharp disagreements over what freedom of speech and press meant in 1789, even as Madison drafted the amendment. Students will learn about the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. The course will look at freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His most recent book, Ellery\u2019s Protest, tells the story of one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of the last century, Abington School District v. Schempp, in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies      (FRSEM-UA 255; class #7075)   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.     ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for Social Work in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.      Disease and History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 265; class #13807)   Instructor: Richard Hull   Thursday, 11:00 a.m. \u2013 1:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and lifestyles. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or retard fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? Students read and discuss several core texts and write a short response paper on each. They also write a brief paper on a disease of their choice and discuss their findings in class.     RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns, Modern Africa , and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence.      Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Duelling with Health Science Information      (FRSEM-UA 278; class #13804)   Instructor: Ralph Katz   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The common citizen is well challenged\u2014if not overly challenged\u2014trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \u201cScientific\u201d health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \u201cscientific\u201d health findings of last week. As the movie theme song first asked so poignantly over three decades ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s it all about, Alfie?\u201d This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors, and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \u201cinstant, electronic news\u201d world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, truth, polar bears, limes, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \u201cop-ed\u201d article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.     RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He has been the Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton\u2019s 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master\u2019s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.      From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia      (FRSEM-UA 282; class #7076)   Instructor: Edward W. Lehman   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The second decade of the new millennium has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive moral and social transformations which have occurred in Western civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on formative developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism . We then examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America , which paints a much more upbeat picture of what is happening around us.     EDWARD W. LEHMAN is Professor Emeritus of Sociology. His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities.      Communications and Human Values      (FRSEM-UA 291; class #7077)   Instructor: Richard D. Heffner   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      This seminar is an intellectual inquiry into the development of American public policy as it relates to mass communications. It is not a practicum, not a \u201chow-to\u201d course about film and television, nor about the media generally. The seminar\u2019s purpose is instead to analyze how much of our sense of what it means to be an American early in the 21st century has been molded by the media\u2014first print and now increasingly electronic\u2014with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To learn about and then deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the role of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through class discussion of such readings as Walter Lippmann\u2019s Public Opinion , Robert Merton\u2019s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill\u2019s On Liberty , Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd , and Neil Postman\u2019s Amusing Ourselves to Death ; of such films as Hearts and Minds, JFK , and Fahrenheit 9/11 ; and of the increasingly unfair and unbalanced rants and raves of America\u2019s newer communications outlets. Finally, class emphasis is placed on analyzing and resolving such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \u201cmobocracy,\u201d with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); the importance of journalistic \u201cprivilege\u201d; and media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).     RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began over half a century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York\u2019s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952; Eighth Revised and Updated Edition\u2014with Alexander Heffner\u20142009) and the editor of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America (1956; reissued 2010). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and his paperback edition of As They Saw It\u2026 A Half Century of Conversations from the Open Mind (2003). From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry\u2019s voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.      The Crusades and Their Legacy      (FRSEM-UA 296; class #7078)   Instructor: Jill N. Claster   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     The Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom, or Outremer, the lands across the sea. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, the background which made it possible for thousands of people for over two centuries to join the crusading movement, and the religious ardor which informed the Crusades. It also focuses on life in the Latin Kingdom in the Holy Land, particularly on the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Most of all, the course addresses many issues that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the centuries-long legacy of the crusading era.     JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 (2009). She served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.      Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?      (FRSEM-UA 306; class #7079)   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30 p.m.-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.     JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies. Professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico since 1979, he has also been a visiting professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Princeton, and Dartmouth. A principal strategist in the election campaign of President Vicente Fox in 2000, he served as Mexico\u2019s Foreign Minister from late 2000 until early 2003. He is the author of nineteen books, including, in English, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.      Documentary Theater      (FRSEM-UA 351; class #7081)   Instructor: Carol Martin   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     This course explores the subject matter, history and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary theatre. By analyzing the content, structure and dramatic devices of a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of human behavior from everyday life to important political events in the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We will read plays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the cover up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the simulated and the virtual?     CAROL MARTIN is Professor of Drama at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She writes on documentary theatre, contemporary American and Japanese performance, as well as on performance and globalization. Her essays and interviews have appeared in academic journals in the U.S. and abroad and in the New York Times and have been translated into French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese. Her most recent book is Dramaturgy of the Real on the World Stage .      Literary Theory and Its Applications      (FRSEM-UA 355; class #7082)   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Students in this seminar will read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century to the present. They will learn to consider different approaches to literature. They will complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.     JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of m Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading.

From Mind to Brain and Back Again      (FRSEM-UA 357; class #16356)   Instructor: Joseph LeDoux   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     What is mind? Is it a system of impulses or something changeable? This paraphrase of a Bart Simpson remark captures one of the great debates in history: to what extent are we hard-wired as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, fundamental questions such as these were addressed by philosophers. The birth of psychology in the late 19th century gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we address these questions, looking at the issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries. We use the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain.      JOSEPH LEDOUX is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, and a member of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU. He received his Ph.D. in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1977.

He is the recipient of the 2005 Fyssen International Prize in Cognitive Science. He is also a member of a rock band, The Amygdaloids, an all-NYU band that plays original music about mind and brain. They have two CDs: Heavy Mental and Theory of My Mind .      The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1590-1680: The Age of Caravaggio and Bernini      (FRSEM-UA 366; class #13805)   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Recent biographies of Caravaggio and Bernini provide the basis for this course, which takes papal patronage of the arts in seventeenth-century Rome as its subject. We will explore the reigns of Sixtus V, Paul V, Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII\u2014all \u201cbuilder\u201d popes from a time when Rome was considered the artistic capital of Europe\u2014and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture and city planning they sponsored. In addition to Caravaggio and Bernini, whose clay models will be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the fall, we will study (among others) Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. During the first weeks of the semester, students will present short biographies of a number of the outstanding personalities of the Counter Reformation and Baroque, from saints to nobles to prelates. Particular stress will be placed on those messages, religious and secular, that were specifically expressed in the rebuilding of the ancient and early Christian city of Rome and its monuments, including such magisterial works as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, along with many city squares, churches, monasteries, villas and palaces.

The Writer in New York      (FRSEM-UA 367; class #8879)   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.     VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content (2002). His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, the Nation, the New York Times Magazine, and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.      Welcome to College: The Novel      (FRSEM-UA 371; class #7083)   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we will read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We will discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students will write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.

Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies      (FRSEM-UA 377; class #8167)   Instructor: Liana Theodoratou   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The mythic figure of Medea has held our imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present in order to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.     LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.

She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece .      The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right      (FRSEM-UA 379; class #7084)   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester.     MICHAEL E. MAKOVER, M.D., is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine, Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center, and in active practice of internal medicine and rheumatology.

New York City: A Survey, 1609\u20131898      (FRSEM-UA 383; class #7086)   Instructor: Leo Hershkowitz   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12 p.m.     In this study of New York City, we shall look for answers to several basic questions. For example, how did the city become the \u201cWorld\u2019s Capital\u201d? Why is New York so different from other American cities? Why is it the center of art, music, finance, science? Is New York an American city? How have artists, writers, and travelers viewed New York? How do New Yorkers see New York? What is its future? This is also a voyage into unknown New York by means of archival sources largely overlooked by historians, but which are important to understanding the complexity, as well as the excitement, that is New York history. Many of these primary sources are now in the Tamiment Library at NYU, while others are at the New York Historical Society and such city agencies as the offices of the County Clerk, the Municipal Archives, and Register of New York County. The materials found there are basic to the lectures, discussions, and students\u2019 papers in the class. There will also be a walking tour of lower Manhattan and visits to a number of institutions where archival materials are housed.     LEO HERSHKOWITZ, Professor of History at Queens College, CUNY, has written widely on aspects of New York City history. His work has also included testimony before the U.S. Supreme Court (1997) and consultancy to the New York Attorney General, the County Clerk of New York County, and the Appellate Division of the State of New York, First Department. He has presented many papers at such diverse institutions as the Museum of the City of New York, Jewish Historical Society of England, American Jewish Historical Society, New York State Medical Society, and Columbia University. He received a Ph.D. in history from New York University and a Doctorate of Humane Letters from the Hebrew Union College, Jewish Institute of Religion.      Computational Thought      (FRSEM-UA 385; class #7087)   Instructor: Dennis Shasha   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience     Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style will combine straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students will make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, evolutionarily inspired robots, DNA computing, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.     DENNIS E. SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science. His fields of research include computational biology, technologically enhanced privacy, and pattern matching. On the way to becoming a computer scientist, he studied linguistics, engineering, and philosophy. You can find some of his puzzles on the Scientific American website : www.sciam.com .      Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine &amp; Other Sources      (FRSEM-UA 393; class #7089)   Instructor: Michele Shedlin   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we will focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This will guide our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students will become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort.      MICHELLE SHEDLIN, Ph.D., Professor, NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care.

She maintains adjunct faculty appointments at Columbia University, University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Connecticut. Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.      America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II      (FRSEM-UA 405; class #7094)   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950. Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than 60-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the  insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.

Branding: People, Places, Things      (FRSEM-UA 422; class #7096)   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     As thinking people, we want to believe that we are resistant to branding and its most obvious tool, advertising. Yet both penetrate: occasionally honestly, sometimes deviously, often entertainingly. How do they do it, even when our guards are up? Why do we revere Apple, feel wary of American Apparel, admire Google, and resent BP? Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us, and companies often don\u2019t really know what works, or how; sometimes, they are just lucky. Brands also have a darker side, according to some social commentators, and may lead to mass consumer hypnosis. This course analyzes what makes brands tick, how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and politicians, taking a short look back at the creation of \u201cObama Nation\u201d and a long look back to 1968, when many of today\u2019s tools were developed. We then cross the moat to our own lives, asking ourselves: how are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own reputations; that is, our own \u201cbrands\u201d?     RICHARD L.LEWIS is an independent marketing doctor who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, leading the ABSOLUT vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.      Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music, Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition      (FRSEM-UA 427; class # 7097)   Instructor: Gary Marcus   Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     A look at music and video games from the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music? Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel experiment.     GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader ; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .      Trials of the Century      (FRSEM-UA 434; class #7100)   Instructor: Jack Ford   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the \u201cScottsboro Boys,\u201d will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the \u201cChicago Seven.\u201d And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial.\u201d Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law.     JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, Mr. Ford most recently served as the Anchor of Jack Ford: Courtside on COURT TV , which he helped launch in 1991. He has also served as Chief Legal Correspondent on NBC News and as an Anchor/Correspondent for ABC News. As a trial attorney, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial, one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases, and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s, and authored a number of articles for respected legal publications. He is the recipient of five honorary degrees, recognizing his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service work.      History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.      (FRSEM-UA 437; class #7102)   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.     This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.     JACK SALZMAN has been the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching award, and twice has been awarded a Fulbright Professorship. He formerly served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University, and for thirty years was the editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the five-volume Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.      The \u201cLong 19th Century\u201d: Sixty Glorious Years, 1876\u20131936      (FRSEM-UA 439; class #13806)   Instructor: Rena Mueller   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The historical narrative of the \u201clong century,\u201d as defined by British historian Eric Hobsbawm, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. But this idea of the \u201clong century\u201d when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, the period from 1876 to 1936 is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition\u2014and frequently unruly first performances\u2014of Schoenberg\u2019s Second String Quartet, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Berg, Webern, and Bart\u00f3k. Richard Strauss\u2019s operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with L\u00e9har\u2019s The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus\u2019s The Chocolate Soldier , among others.   This class will explore the \u201cisms\u201d most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes\u2014musical musical evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety\u2014will form the core of the class. In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \u201cfin-de-si\u00e8cle\u201d) and Paris (the positive \u201cla belle \u00c9poque\u201d), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Br\u00fccke, the Bauhaus, the Fauves, L\u2019art nouveau, and Cubism.

Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature      (FRSEM-UA 440; class # 7103)   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Monday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through the study of stories, novels, nonfiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the 20th century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme.     SAUL ROSENBERG, who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He has also been a consultant at McKinsey and Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he now manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal .      Three Moments in Witchcraft      (FRSEM-UA 441; class #7104)   Instructor: Laura Levine   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     In I Samuel 28, when King Saul wants to know what to do about the army of Philistines gathering at his door, he seeks out the witch of Endor to conjure up the dead Samuel to answer his questions. Renaissance commentators puzzled over what it is that the witch summoned up: a devil? The real Samuel? \u201cAn illusion\u201d says Reginald Scot in his Discoverie, the first book in the period to offer a theory of witch-hunts as scapegoating. For him, the witch of Endor was a ventriloquist. King James I of England also saw the scene as one of theater, but for him it was the devil playing Samuel. What lies at the root of the association between witchcraft and theater during the period? When Spenser has his heroes in Book I of The Faerie Queene strip the witch Duessa to look at her naked body, how is he commenting on the theatricality of judicial procedures? Why does The Winter\u2019s Tale \u2019s Leontes throw Paulina out of his chambers as a \u201cmankind witch\u201d? This course seeks to answer such questions, beginning with the Bible, focusing on the Renaissance and ending with the story of a mouse who was a witch and Balanchine\u2019s re-creation of the moment as a ballet.

Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 442; class #16512)   Instructor: William Klein   Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as it did in the case of Galileo)? Are there truths that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, and \u017di\u017eek.     WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of The Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of political discourse in Liberal Studies, and conducts seminars on a variety of topics for the honors program in CAS. He is currently writing a study on the history and theory of sedition. In previous lives he worked as a ghost writer, an editor and a carpenter (hence the title of a recent piece on one of Italy's great artists, Franca Ghitti: \"Naive Notes on Franca's Nails by a Former Carpenter\"). In 2011-12 he taught for NYU in Florence.       Financial Systems as Social Forms: Comparing Conventional and Islamic Finance      (FRSEM-UA 444; class #8203)   Instructor: Mary Poovey   Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Financial systems direct the flow of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also reflect and help shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. In this course we compare and contrast the theories implicit in the financial systems of the United States and most other Western countries and those implicit in  Islamic financial institutions, which now exist in many parts of the world. The most basic distinction between the two systems involves assumptions about the economy and the individuals who participate in it. In the US, the economy is assumed to govern itself by the law of supply and demand, and individuals are assumed to be rational agents who seek to maximize their own profit and minimize personal loss. Credit\u2014and therefore debt\u2014is central to the US economy because interest-based financing is the primary mechanism for transferring money from one party to another.      In Islamic finance, by contrast, commercial transactions are governed by Shari\u2019ah law because the economy, like every other facet of life, is subject to the commands of Allah and because human reason is considered fallible. While Shari\u2019ah law bans one fundamental part of the US system\u2014interest\u2014it does recognize the principle of profit and loss sharing, and special financial instruments have been developed to enable individuals and institutions to form partnerships, transfer capital, and generate profits.      By comparing these two systems and the practices they require, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in an increasingly interconnected global context.       MARY POOVEY is the Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities and Professor of English at New York University. She received a Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence from the College, and she was also recognized for excellence in teaching by Swarthmore College.

This course grows out of her current project, which is a co-authored book exploring the ways financial instruments and institutions shape the ways their users understand themselves and interact with the world.      From St. Petersburg to Paris and New York: George Balanchine and the Politics of Modernism      (FRSEM-UA 445; class #8204)   Instructor: Jennifer Homans   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course is a biography of modernism, told through the life and work of the ballet master George Balanchine. We trace Balanchine\u2019s path and artistic development from his birth in Imperial St. Petersburg in 1904 through the political and artistic tumult of the Russian Revolution, to Paris in the 1920s, where he collaborated with Serge Diaghilev and artists, dancers, and composers working at the forefront of modernism. From 1933 until his death in 1983, Balanchine lived in New York, where he and other \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists transformed the cultural life of the city. What did Balanchine\u2019s dances have to do with the political culture of Petersburg, Paris and New York? Can we trace the relationship between his life and his art?     Readings will range from history to memoir and biography. Students will also attend live performances and study dances and other forms of art at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim Museum of Art. Grades will be based on weekly writing assignments, class participation, and an in-class presentation analyzing a dance or other work of art in its historical context.     JENNIFER HOMANS is the author of Apollo\u2019s Angels: A History of Ballet (2010) and the dance critic for the New Republic . She has also published with the New York Times, the New York Review of Books , and the Guardian , among others.

Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature      (FRSEM-UA 449; class #13813)   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Phillip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.     EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.     ERIC GIOIA, ESQ. is an attorney with over eleven years of experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P.

Mr. Gioia holds a B.A. from New York University and a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center.      Literature, Economics, and History in 18th-Century Britain      (FRSEM-UA 460; class #8941)   Instructor: Kevin Brine   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Few authors have had more influence on modern thought than Adam Smith, Samuel Johnson, and Edward Gibbon. Smith defined the terms by which we understand modern economics; Johnson taught us how to read English literature; and Gibbon pointed the way to modern historiography with an account of the Roman Empire that has never been surpassed. All three were members of the same Literary Club, founded by Johnson and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. In 1791, Club member James Boswell published the remarkable biography Life of Johnson , which vividly portrays the intellectual life of Georgian Britain through an astounding wealth of anecdotes, intellectual repartee, and the personal details of an unforgettable and larger-than- life Samuel Johnson. In this course we read selections from Life of Johnson , Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations (1776), and Gibbon\u2019s The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (1776), with an eye toward the contemporary relevance of these works. Students come to know Samuel Johnson as though he were a family friend, gain a deep understanding of Adam Smith\u2019s concept of how a modern economy works, and see the ancient grandeur of Rome through the eyes of one of the world\u2019s most influential historians. Working in small groups, students learn to present their ideas in a seminar setting and improve their writing skills with assignments geared toward expressing their ideas and insights.     KEVIN R. BRINE had a long and successful career on Wall Street, before turning to the study and practice of three of his passions: literature, art, and economics.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber      (FRSEM-UA 461; class #8960)   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English.     JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

Oral History of Irish America      (FRSEM-UA 462; class #8971)   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. -12:00 noon    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to documenting the lived experience of Irish Americans and their communities in a small class setting. The course reviews the methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the opportunity to create an original public history document that will be deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by scholars in a variety of research projects. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen from the Irish American community in New York City. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an Oscar and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director, a National Book Award-winning novelist, as well as actors, musicians, teachers, and Wall Street executives. In addition to the interview, the course includes classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises. The final project (which will undergo careful editing and numerous rewrites) includes a biography and full finding aid to the interview for the archive, as well as web content that will be launched on the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History website. This course offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers.     LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Specializing in twentieth-century immigration, Professor Almeida has focused primarily on the \u201cNew Irish\u201d of the 1980s and 90s, publishing chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006).

She has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.      Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\"      (FRSEM-UA 463; class #14260)   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.      SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).      Literature of the Absurd      (FRSEM-UA 464; class #14251)   Instructor: Thomas Bishop   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The absurd sensibility has profoundly marked writers of many countries and languages since the start of the 20th century. The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950's in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued world-wide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, Stoppard, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post-World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of human\u2019s condition on this earth and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the landmark Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages [which were] swept away\u2026found wanting\u2026and discredited.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary and the seminal depiction of the absurd for his century; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertesz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, and more recently, Woody Allen. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, an era that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and with it human\u2019s ability for the first time of destroying itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd would be a dominant stance, even if the absurd if often treated with devastating humor.   TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature, and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization.

He has received numerous decorations from the French government as well as the Grand Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. He earned an OBIE award for achievement in Off-Broadway Theatre.      Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel      (FRSEM-UA 466; class #14269)   Instructor: Ilya Kriger   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we will try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, will be supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others.      ILYA KLIGER is assistant professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explores the parallel developments of the notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.      The Statue of Liberty: Icon of America      (FRSEM-UA 467; class #14253)   Instructor: Edward Berenson   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most beloved of all American symbols. Yet no one living in 1885, when the crated monument arrived in New York Harbor, could have foreseen the central place the Statue of Liberty would come to occupy in the American imagination. Most Americans had never heard of the French intellectuals who proposed to build it, and many thought the whole idea presumptuous and bizarre. The statue\u2019s supporters feared it would never go up. The course will begin with Liberty\u2019s uncertain origins in French art and politics and then consider the trials of its reception and construction in New York Harbor. We will see how the statue\u2019s symbolically indistinct, neoclassical form has allowed Americans to interpret its meaning in diverse ways: as representing the emancipation of the slaves, Tocqueville's ideal of orderly liberty, opportunity for \"huddled masses,\" and, in the years since 9/11, the freedom and resilience of the United States and New York City in the face of terror. We will also examine the statue\u2019s prominent role in American popular culture. About midway through the semester, the class will take the ferry to Liberty Island and climb to the statue\u2019s crown.     EDWARD BERENSON is professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at NYU. In 1999, he won the American Historical Association\u2019s Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award. He is the author or editor of six books, the most recent of which are Heroes of Empire: Five Charismatic Men and the Conquest of Africa (2010) and The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story (2012).       Schools in the Greek and Roman World      (FRSEM-UA 468; class #14255)   Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      This course will give students knowledge of ancient schooling in the Greek and Roman worlds and will cover liberal arts education (in its three levels, primary, grammatical, and rhetorical) and schools of medicine. Some scholars have recently maintained that the network of schools in the ancient world was so puny that the levels of illiteracy were extremely high. Yet it is important to take into account that it is difficult to identify schools because they were usually not housed in buildings designated for this purpose, often occupied private quarters, and education went on in the open air or within the family. At the end of the course students will realize that much caution is needed in evaluating education in the ancient world.     The course will be based on the literary sources, the school exercises from Greek and Roman Egypt, and on archaeological sources. Students will examine evidence regarding schools that have recently come to light in Rome and Greek Alexandria. They will pay special attention to the Greek school found in Egypt in the Dakhla Oasis through the excavation sponsored by New York University.     RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is a professor in the Department of Classics and is considered an expert in ancient education. His first book was Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt (Scholars Press 1996), which contained a catalogue of 406 school exercises that emerged from the sands of Egypt. This book was followed by Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt (Princeton 2001). This book was awarded the Goodwin Prize in 2003, the most prestigious award in the field of Classics. In 2006, Professor Cribiore wrote, in collaboration with Roger Bagnall, Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (Michigan University Press). In 2007 he published again with Princeton University Press The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , which studied a very prestigious school of rhetoric in Syria.      Pagans and Christians in Roman Egypt      (FRSEM-UA 469; class #14256)   Instructor: Nicola Aravecchia   Friday, 9:30-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This course explores the subject of paganism in late Roman Egypt and the role that Christianity played in shaping a new religious, social, and cultural environment between the third and sixth centuries CE. The goal is to gain an understanding of the process by which the new religion spread in a heavily Hellenized part of the Mediterranean world, influenced by Classical culture and religious beliefs but also attached to its traditional religious heritage. The seminar will touch upon issues of religious and cultural resistance, imperial involvement, official propaganda, proselytism, and syncretic manifestations of devotional practice. Attention will also be paid to the variety of forms in which Christianity (and modes of Christian life) developed in Egypt, expressive of a complex but deeply fascinating world of ideas and beliefs. The religious topography of pre-Christian Egypt, in which temples were prime visual landmarks, will be examined and compared with the dramatic changes brought by the appearance and dissemination of Christian places of cult and monastic life.     NICOLA ARAVECCHIA is Clinical Assistant Professor of Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and the academic director of New York University\u2019s semester abroad program in Egypt. His research interests concern Egypt in Late Antiquity and focus on the origins and development of Early Christian art and architecture in that region of the Mediterranean world. He also has a strong interest in the application of models of spatial analysis to archaeology, with the goal of studying how public and private spaces were constructed and used in antiquity and how they affected social relationships. He is the field director of the archaeological mission of Ain el-Gedida, a fourth-century settlement in the Dakhla Oasis of Upper Egypt, where he has been excavating since 2006. Currently, he is working on the final archaeological report of the 2006-2008 excavation seasons. He is also the deputy field director of the archaeological mission of Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis.      Picasso: Poetry and Invention      (FRSEM-UA 470; class #14257)   Instructor: Pepe Karmel   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Pablo Picasso is widely recognized as the greatest artist of the 20th century. But what is it that makes his work so powerful and influential? This seminar will explore Picasso\u2019s achievement in depth, looking at paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints from all eight decades of his career. On one hand, we will look at the astonishing series of new formal languages that he invented between 1907 through 1957. On the other, we will look at Picasso\u2019s remarkable work as a figurative storyteller and poet, exploring the fundamental human emotions of joy and sorrow, love and desire, alienation and aggression. Along with texts by biographers, critics, and art historians, we will read works by poets such as, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, and Paul Eluard,who were his closest friends.      PEPE KARMEL teaches in the Department of Art History, New York University. His book, Picasso and the Invention of Cubism , was published by Yale University Press in 2003.

A Nation of War      (FRSEM-UA 471; class #14398)   Instructor: Nikhil Singh   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore a controversial proposition: to what extent is the US a nation defined by commitments to and capacities for making war? Coming of age in the years since 9/11, many of you will not have known a time when the nation was not at war.      We will explore societal interests and attitudes that sustain an interest in war. For example, wars are commonly presented to the general public as necessary to preserve security, and ironically as a means toward peace. In the 1950s President Eisenhower warned of the rise of a \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d that grew independent of any strategic or security interest. Some have argued that recent wars have been motivated by struggles over resources, particularly oil.      In the contemporary moment, publics are shielded from the consequences of war and thus may have different perspectives from combatants, soldiers and casualties of war. Wars can both unify a people and sharpen domestic political conflicts and societal divisions.      We will use selected course readings and documentary screenings to explore a range of social, philosophical and personal standpoints on America\u2019s wars past, present and future in an effort to answer an age-old question: \u201cwar, what is it good for?\u201d     NIKHIL PAL SINGH is Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History. He is a recent winner of NYU\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. teaching award.

He is the author of the prize-winning book, Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy , and is currently completing a work entitled Exceptional Empire: Race and War in US Globalism .      21st Century Literature: Methods, Materials, Maps      (FRSEM-UA 473; class #14399)   Instructor: Elaine Freedgood   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will read a selection of novels, poetry, and journalism written in the last twelve years that will help us explore the issues raised in the course\u2019s subtitle: \u201cmethods, materials and maps.\u201d The methods writers use in the twenty-first century to depict internal and external worlds, including realism, postmodernism, digital operations of chance and data mining, and poetry deviate significantly from our ideas of the lyric and the personal. Materials include illustrations\u2014the graphic novel and the comic, the artist\u2019s book, electronic media, and self-published zines. What is the geography of current world literature? What is global and/or local about it? The course will include \u201cfield trips\u201d to poetry and prose readings, book stores, and exhibits of printed and digital matter. Writers will include Indra Sinha, Chris Ware, Young Hae-Chang, Orhan Pamuk, Maureen McLane, Ian MacEwan, Karenn Tei Yamashita, Jesmyn Ward, Dexter Filkins, and Ed Roberson.      ELAINE FREEDGOOD is the author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (Cambridge 2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago 2006), and also the editor of Factory Production in Victorian Britain (Oxford 2003).

(FRSEM-UA 474; class #14400)   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It will also prompt you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the 21st century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we will study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment?     TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.      Why Lincoln Matters: Re-Envisioning the Politically Possible      (FRSEM-UA 475; class #14401)   Instructor: Philip Kunhardt   Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How was a man with less than a year of formal education able to become one of the nation\u2019s most salient political actors? Coinciding with the 2012 presidential election, and with the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, this seminar will involve students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American presidencies. In an effort to understand why his memory still matters, and what contemporary political leaders can learn from his example, we will examine Lincoln\u2019s core writings and speeches for historical context, literary and political merit, and impact on the thinking of the American public. We will look at Lincoln\u2019s role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric, and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How was he influenced by other figures around him\u2014southerners, abolitionists, former slaves, and social conservatives? And how did he learn to use words so effectively to help produce social transformation? Lessons and warnings applicable to today will enter into our intensive group discussion. In papers and presentations students will examine aspects of presidential leadership of most interest to them and develop their writing and communication skills. In addition to Lincoln\u2019s published words, drawn from Roy Basler, Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings , texts will include David H. Donald, Lincoln ; Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial: Lincoln and Slavery ; ibid, Our Lincoln ; James Oakes, The Radical and the Republican ; Douglas Wilson, Honor\u2019s Voice ; and ibid, Lincoln\u2019s Sword . Students may also read a book on the American presidency as an institution, and on Barack Obama and/or his opposing candidate in the 2012 elections.

Swing Counties 2012: The Bush-Obama America      (FRSEM-UA 479; class #16513)   Instructor: David Dent   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     George Bush and Barack Obama are two very different leaders. Yet they have 272 counties in common. George Bush won those counties in 2000 and 2004 and Barack Obama won them in 2008. This course explores American politics and the electoral process through the prism of swing counties and voters. How do such voters and counties exist in this age of ideological polarization? Readings will include Dreams from My Father, Red State Blue State , among other articles and books that explore swing voters. Students will write two Op Ed pieces related to the concept of swing voters and complete a final project.      DAVID J.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law      (FRSEM-UA 480; class #16699)   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What's the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments.     SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009.

Cannibalism      (FRSEM-UA 481; class # 16700)   Instructor: Dylon Robbins   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Western thought teaches us that people who eat people are \u201cbad.\u201d Indeed, the notion of cannibalism is a recurring concern in the history of ideas regarding the primitive, the animalistic, the monstrous, or any of the other classifications frequently invoked to mark others, regardless of their actual culinary preferences. An extended reflection on cannibalism as an intellectual phenomenon suggests how people eating people, or at least the possibility of it, says a great deal about those that do not. Interesting, as well, is the fact that, in some regions of the Caribbean and Brazil, ideas regarding cannibalism have made an important turn, such that the cannibal has become a provocative affirmation of self. The aim of this course is to think about cannibalism, not, as it often is, as a theme for anthropologists and ethnographers, but rather as an intellectual problem that has enjoyed a very long life in the history of ideas about self. In this course, we shall revisit a selection of texts regarding cannibalism from Columbus\u2019 diaries to the present, and including many noteworthy and fascinating interventions about the idea of cannibalism by, among others, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Cabeza de Vaca, Hans Staden, Goya, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, Oswald de Andrade, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.     DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular interest in the cultural and theoretical production of these regions, in addition to that of the African Diasporas in general, with particular concern for intellectual and cultural histories, media, cinema, and popular music. His work is supported by archival research in Brazil as a Fulbright-Hays fellow at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros, and in Cuba at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. He is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.      Audiovisual Stories: Creative Documentary Filmmaking in Latin America (2000\u20132012)      (FRSEM-UA 483; class #17048)   Instructor: Alexandra Falek   Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Creative documentaries present their subject in a poetic manner; they experiment with the formal and conceptual possibilities of storytelling by proposing an artistic engagement and (re)presentation of the questions, problems and ideas they explore. In Latin America, they are a vital part of long-standing film traditions. This seminar offers students the opportunity to acquire practical and perceptive skills related to the interpretation and analysis of recent creative documentaries made by renowned and new directors. We will examine the use and construction of storytelling elements (visual, aural, emotional, narrative, structural) in each film, always considering pertinent issues related to the film\u2019s particular production, exhibition and distribution contexts. As a way of building a strong foundation for the notions of \u201ccreativity\u201d and \u201cpoetry\u201d in filmmaking, we will make regular reference to seminal essays on classic documentary approaches and strategies. Students will develop critical proficiency by watching films on a regular basis, reading relevant texts by filmmakers, theorists and critics, and writing short exercises and a final project.     ALEXANDRA FALEK has been teaching at NYU since 2001 in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Languages and Literatures, first as a doctoral student and since 2008, as an Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow. She was the co-director of Latin American Film Festival at NYU (2011) and the director of Uruguay Film Fest (2011). Her most recent teaching, research and publication explorations focus on documentary filmmaking in Latin America.      Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 484; class #17214)   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship \u2013 the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics will include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of how New York City is an international city that has turned diversity into strength. The seminar will bring in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions \u2013 ranging from activism to business leadership \u2013 may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? How do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? As part of the seminar we will travel to NYU\u2019s Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center in Washington, D.C., to visit an international organization, NGO, or federal agency that is engaged globally.

See It, Read It: Photography and Writing in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 486; class #17131)   Instructor: Lourdes D\u00e1vila   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What is a photograph? How do we read photographs? How has photography shaped history and fiction, our ideas of the self and of others? The purpose of this course is to analyze the history of photography and its relation with textual productions in XX and XXI century Latin American writers. We will begin by studying how the technology of photography (which arrived in Latin America almost simultaneously with its creation in Europe) contributed to a particular visual construction of Latin America and was incorporated into literary writings from the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern Cone. The main objective of the course will be to analyze the use of photography in literary and extra-literary texts, from texts that use photography as its discursive axis (but without containing real photographs) to texts that play on the page with photographic reproductions. Topics includ: photography and history, photography and archive, photography and madness, photography and the city, photography and memory, and photography and eroticism. We will consider texts and photographs by Roberto Arlt, Leopoldo Lugones, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Elena Poniatowska, Mario Bellatin, Ana Mar\u00eda Berecochea, and Paz Err\u00e1zuriz, among others. As we explore how literary authors manipulate photographs on the page or collaborate with photographers, we will look at other international writers, such as W. G. Sebald. This course will count toward the major in Spanish and Latin American Studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.     LOURDES D\u00c1VILA is a member of the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese and a Golden Dozen Teaching Award winner. Since the 1980s, she has written and published widely on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s writing, from Hopscotch to Buenos Aires Buenos Aires to Fantomas Against the Multinational Vampires .

She is is finishing a book on photography and literature in Latin America, is the editor of the forthcoming essay collection La variable Bellatin , and has worked as a translator since the early eighties, both in the field of art and in literature. Her two latest literary translations are Corner of the Dead , (English to Spanish), a short novel by award-winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Silvalandia (Spanish to English).       The Past\u2019s Presence      (FRSEM-UA 487; class #17132)   Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How do we remember the past? And what do we learn from it? This course will take up questions of remembering, reflecting on, and writing the past through three lenses. We will begin the semester by reading a selection of African American authors who recast narratives of slavery in contemporary literature. Reading these \u201cneo-slave narratives\u201d will allow us to think about the ways history can be retold in imaginative ways and to explore the complex relationship between nostalgia and critique embodied in the return to the sites of slavery. We will also read works of narrative history and \u201cexperimental\u201d history as a way to think through what counts as meaningful scholarship, whether literary or historical. Finally, students will embark on hands-on research projects of their own design, viewing the past through the authors, texts, locations or institutions that can be recovered by examining primary and archival sources available digitally and/or in New York City. This is a course for those interested in honing their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers, and for those interested in the process of reading, research and writing, their joys and their frustrations.     ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction.

Her research interests and teaching are primarily focused on American and African American literary history, print culture studies, and archival research methods.       Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism      (FRSEM-UA 488; class #17133)   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course will study the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied 17th century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential.     WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.      Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis      (FRSEM-UA 489; class #17139)   Instructor: Katherine Smith   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses.     KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, Katherine's dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Katherine spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity. An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. Katherine is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled In Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art, which will open in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.      Feeling Beauty: Aesthetics and Cognitive Science      (FRSEM-UA 492; class # 17191)   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Monday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Why do the arts\u2014as diverse as they are in form and in the modes by which they appeal to body and mind\u2014move us as powerfully as they do? This course explores this question from three perspectives: from that of the philosophical tradition of aesthetics, from that of cognitive neuroscience, and from the that of the arts themselves. Students will read Plato, Kant, Burke, Keats, Elizabeth Bishop, as well as work by neuroscientists, and will engage works of music and of visual art.     G. Gabrielle Starr is Associate Professor of English and Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the  aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.       SPRING 2013       Word and Image      (FRSEM-UA 399; class # 12920)   Instructor: Mark Podwal   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 10:00-11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem, I Paint What I See, parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and a Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits will be assigned.     MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For 38 years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast this year on PBS.      Drama Criticism: In History and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 459, class # 12923)   Instructor: Ethan Youngerman   Thursday, 2:00 \u2013 4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play's production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York's newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history.     ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is the Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College and a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where he's won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the faculty a decade ago. He's also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including: Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play, The Sublet Experiment , ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from The New York Times, The AP, New York Magazine and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU.                           The Early History of God      (FRSEM-UA 472; class # 12927)   Instructor: Mark Smith   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     Like other areas of human life and experience, gods and goddesses are complex phenomena, requiring study and thinking. This course focuses on how gods and goddesses (deities) \u2013 and divinity more broadly \u2013 were understood in ancient literatures. We will consider Gilgamesh and the Epic of Creation from Mesopotamia, Canaanite myths and legends, and Israel\u2019s Bible/Old Testament, among other texts. This course centers on the \u201cjob description\u201d of gods and goddesses (what deities are and what they have to be able to do to qualify as deities); the emotions of deities (anger, love, fear, etc.); their gender and sexuality; the animals thought to represent them (\u201cemblem animals\u201d); the various relationships of deities to one another and to humans; the divine creation of the world and of humanity; and deities in love and war. The course also addresses \"monotheism\" in ancient Israel, namely, the belief in only one god.   MARK S. SMITH holds the Skirball Chair of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale in 1985. He has served twice as Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.. He was honored as President of the Catholic Biblical Association of America in 2010-2011, and in 2011 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research. He is also a two-time winner of New York University\u2019s Golden Dozen Award and the recipient of the Frank Moore Cross award for publication awarded by the American Schools of Oriental Research. He has published over eighty articles, including first editions of four minor manuscripts from Cave Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He has authored thirteen books and co-authored three others.      Political Theater      (FRSEM-UA 476; class # 12940)   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective on these questions. In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, students will learn about the development of different dramatic techniques and forms through the history of theater, about the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy, and about the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques.     ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.      Physics at Accelerators      (FRSEM-UA 477; class # 12933)   Instructor: Henry Stroke   Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     We will look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These will involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radiofrequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion will be based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion will require an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, will be introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei will lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection will be discussed, as will nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, will be among the numerous detection techniques encountered.     HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radiofrequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \"on-line\" mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible  non-zero neutrino mass.    Heloise: A Woman for the Twelfth Century      (FRSEM-UA 478; class # 12934)   Instructor: Fiona Griffiths   Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      Few medieval women have been so often studied and yet so little understood as Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete (d. 1164). Her life, known primarily through the letters that she exchanged with her former husband, the philosopher Peter Abelard (d. 1142), offers a study in contradiction: she was an educated woman at a time when women were supposedly barred from education; a nun who, though dedicated to God, battled sexual desire; a mother, whose spiritual daughters seemingly displaced her one biological son; and a wife, whose husband became her \u201cbrother\u201d in Christ. Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine. Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard. This seminar revises the traditional image of Heloise, dignifying her as a scholar, monastic reformer, and administrator\u2014as well as a lover, wife, mother, and friend.      FIONA J. GRIFFITHS, Associate Professor in the Department of History, is a medievalist who focuses on women and gender within the monastic life from late antiquity through the thirteenth century. A Canadian by birth, she earned her PhD from Cambridge University and has received fellowships from the Institute of Historical Research (London), the National Endowment for the Humanities, Harvard University, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung.      Comparative Revisionism in Historical Writing      (FRSEM-UA 482; class # 12935)   Instructor: Joe Lee   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      'Revisionist' and 'Revisionism' are two of the most widely used terms in recent historical discourse to describe particular types of historical writing. They are used as terms of praise, criticism, and abuse. This course seeks to explore the modalities of thought of both revisionists and their critics by looking at a number of case-studies in comparative historical perspective, striving to locate them in their particular historical circumstances and conjunctures. Case studies concerning specific controversies relating to British, German, Irish and Israeli historical writing, frequently involving foreign, including American, authorities in these fields, will be analyzed to determine what general conclusions, if any, can be deduced concerning modalities of historical thought.     JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU. He was previously at University College Cork (Ireland), where he chaired the History Department and served for periods as Dean of Arts and as Vice President. He is a former Member of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament and former Member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body; he also served as the Chair of the Fulbright Commission for Ireland and as President of the Irish Association for European Studies. He is author of seminal histories of Ireland, The Modernization of Irish Society, 1848-1918 and the prize-winning Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society . His op-ed columns for the Sunday Tribune were collected as The Shifting Balance of Power: Exploring the 20th Century , and he recently co-edited Making the Irish American: The History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States with Marion R. Casey.      American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820-2012      (FRSEM-UA 485; class # 12936)   Instructor: Beth Machlan   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Thursday, 9:30 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.     This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cPanic Room,\u201d and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11.     BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories. Her academic work has appeared in Studies in the Novel, Representing Segregation , and The Los Angeles Review of Books , and her essays have been featured on The Awl, The Hairpin , and The Rumpus .      Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts      (FRSEM-UA 490; class # 12937)   Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons   Class meetings: Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We will examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students will visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art.     AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and won awards from Yale University and Open City magazine. She has worked as a teaching artist in New York City public schools, and last year co-designed and taught a course at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum titled Responding to Art Through Creative Writing. She is a past recipient of NYU's Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a BA from Yale and an  MFA in Fiction Writing from NYU.      The Cultural Work of Play      (FRSEM-UA 491; class # 12938)   Instructor: Louis Bury   Class Meetings: Tuesdays, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note:conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      In his book Homo Ludens , Latin for \"man the player,\" Dutch historian Johan Huizinga defined play as a free and disinterested activity separate from \"real\" or \"ordinary\" life. Yet, free and disinterested as play may appear, the forms it takes and the significance participants and spectators accord to it always carries with them values. In this seminar, we will read across a wide variety of genres and disciplines in order to consider the myriad ways in which people have understood the importance of play and games to culture. As well, we will explore the extent to which work--both academic and otherwise--permits, even encourages, forms of serious play. Possible readings include: articles of the sociology of sport; articles on game theory; treatises on stadium financing and design; novels; memoirs; films; poems; works of ludic, or game-like, literature; works of literary journalism; works of art; works of history; works of anthropology; works of theory/philosophy. In addition to a final research project on the subject of play, students will be expected to compose weekly writing assignments, many of them playful in nature.     LOUIS BURY's first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (forthcoming from Dalkey Archive Press), plays with the conventions of academic writing through the use of arbitrary rules and procedures (such as a chapter written on the subway and a chapter written entirely in questions). He is currently at work on a book of creative non-fiction and cultural criticism entitled The Gym . He is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU and he holds a Ph.D. in English from the CUNY Graduate Center. During graduate school, he supported himself as a part-time professional poker player.      Women in Social Movements in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 493; class # 12939)   Instructor: Pamela Calla   Thursdays, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women's political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This will allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action in relation to their own notions of political and democratic gains and inclusion and attainment (or not) of economic, cultural, racial and gender justice vis-a-vis the state in each country examined.     PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University and director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia.

{"detail": [{"content": "Freshman Honors Seminars: Fall 2012--Spring 2013, CAS | NYU                                                  Navigation       College of Arts and Science                 About Arts and Science | Departments and Programs | The Faculty       About the College | Programs | Students | Admissions | Alumni                  Back to Home             Freshman Honors Seminars: Fall 2012--Spring 2013   THE FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS program in the College of Arts and Science was established in 1992 at the urging of a committee of distinguished faculty members from several schools in the University. The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.          Computer Simulation   (FRSEM-UA 207; class #7071)   Instructor: Charles S. Peskin   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics      Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course, students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.     CHARLES S. PESKIN is Silver Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science. His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.        Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature       (FRSEM-UA 210; class #7072)   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.     FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.      The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America      (FRSEM-UA 218; class #7073)   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. (and several Thursdays in this time slot; see below)   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.       IMPORTANT: Please note amended meeting schedule for this course in the fall 2012 term. Students who are unable to accommodate both the Tuesday and Thursday classes should not register for the course.     Tuesday, September 4   Thursday, September 6   Tuesday, September 11   Thursday, September 20   Tuesday, October 2   Thursday, October 11   Tuesday, October 23   Tuesday, October 30   Tuesday, November 6   Tuesday, November 13   Tuesday, November 20    Last class: Tuesday, November 27     Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level.     JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.      First Amendment Freedom of Expression      (FRSEM-UA 235; class #7074)   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)    Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources who provide critical information for a story of national importance. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the sharp disagreements over what freedom of speech and press meant in 1789, even as Madison drafted the amendment. Students will learn about the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. The course will look at freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His most recent book, Ellery\u2019s Protest, tells the story of one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of the last century, Abington School District v. Schempp, in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies      (FRSEM-UA 255; class #7075)   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.     ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for Social Work in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.      Disease and History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 265; class #13807)   Instructor: Richard Hull   Thursday, 11:00 a.m. \u2013 1:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and lifestyles. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or retard fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? Students read and discuss several core texts and write a short response paper on each. They also write a brief paper on a disease of their choice and discuss their findings in class.

Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Duelling with Health Science Information      (FRSEM-UA 278; class #13804)   Instructor: Ralph Katz   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The common citizen is well challenged\u2014if not overly challenged\u2014trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \u201cScientific\u201d health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \u201cscientific\u201d health findings of last week. As the movie theme song first asked so poignantly over three decades ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s it all about, Alfie?\u201d This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors, and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \u201cinstant, electronic news\u201d world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, truth, polar bears, limes, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \u201cop-ed\u201d article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.     RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry.

His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master\u2019s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.      From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia      (FRSEM-UA 282; class #7076)   Instructor: Edward W. Lehman   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The second decade of the new millennium has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive moral and social transformations which have occurred in Western civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on formative developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism . We then examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America , which paints a much more upbeat picture of what is happening around us.     EDWARD W. LEHMAN is Professor Emeritus of Sociology. His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities.      Communications and Human Values      (FRSEM-UA 291; class #7077)   Instructor: Richard D. Heffner   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      This seminar is an intellectual inquiry into the development of American public policy as it relates to mass communications. It is not a practicum, not a \u201chow-to\u201d course about film and television, nor about the media generally. The seminar\u2019s purpose is instead to analyze how much of our sense of what it means to be an American early in the 21st century has been molded by the media\u2014first print and now increasingly electronic\u2014with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To learn about and then deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the role of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through class discussion of such readings as Walter Lippmann\u2019s Public Opinion , Robert Merton\u2019s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill\u2019s On Liberty , Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd , and Neil Postman\u2019s Amusing Ourselves to Death ; of such films as Hearts and Minds, JFK , and Fahrenheit 9/11 ; and of the increasingly unfair and unbalanced rants and raves of America\u2019s newer communications outlets. Finally, class emphasis is placed on analyzing and resolving such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \u201cmobocracy,\u201d with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); the importance of journalistic \u201cprivilege\u201d; and media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).     RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began over half a century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York\u2019s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952; Eighth Revised and Updated Edition\u2014with Alexander Heffner\u20142009) and the editor of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America (1956; reissued 2010). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and his paperback edition of As They Saw It\u2026 A Half Century of Conversations from the Open Mind (2003). From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry\u2019s voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.      The Crusades and Their Legacy      (FRSEM-UA 296; class #7078)   Instructor: Jill N. Claster   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     The Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom, or Outremer, the lands across the sea. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, the background which made it possible for thousands of people for over two centuries to join the crusading movement, and the religious ardor which informed the Crusades. It also focuses on life in the Latin Kingdom in the Holy Land, particularly on the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Most of all, the course addresses many issues that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the centuries-long legacy of the crusading era.     JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 (2009).

She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.      Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?      (FRSEM-UA 306; class #7079)   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30 p.m.-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.     JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

He is the author of nineteen books, including, in English, Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left after the Cold War; Compa\u00f1ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara; Perpetuating Power; Ex-Mex: From Migrants to Immigrants; and Leftovers: Tales of the Latin American Left (with Marco Morales) He has also written articles for many newspapers and magazines in Mexico, the United States, and other countries.      Documentary Theater      (FRSEM-UA 351; class #7081)   Instructor: Carol Martin   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     This course explores the subject matter, history and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary theatre. By analyzing the content, structure and dramatic devices of a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of human behavior from everyday life to important political events in the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We will read plays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the cover up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the simulated and the virtual?     CAROL MARTIN is Professor of Drama at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She writes on documentary theatre, contemporary American and Japanese performance, as well as on performance and globalization. Her essays and interviews have appeared in academic journals in the U.S. and abroad and in the New York Times and have been translated into French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese. Her most recent book is Dramaturgy of the Real on the World Stage .      Literary Theory and Its Applications      (FRSEM-UA 355; class #7082)   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Students in this seminar will read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century to the present. They will learn to consider different approaches to literature. They will complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.     JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature.

From Mind to Brain and Back Again      (FRSEM-UA 357; class #16356)   Instructor: Joseph LeDoux   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     What is mind? Is it a system of impulses or something changeable? This paraphrase of a Bart Simpson remark captures one of the great debates in history: to what extent are we hard-wired as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, fundamental questions such as these were addressed by philosophers. The birth of psychology in the late 19th century gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we address these questions, looking at the issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries. We use the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain.      JOSEPH LEDOUX is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, and a member of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU. He received his Ph.D. in psychology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook in 1977.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1590-1680: The Age of Caravaggio and Bernini      (FRSEM-UA 366; class #13805)   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Recent biographies of Caravaggio and Bernini provide the basis for this course, which takes papal patronage of the arts in seventeenth-century Rome as its subject. We will explore the reigns of Sixtus V, Paul V, Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII\u2014all \u201cbuilder\u201d popes from a time when Rome was considered the artistic capital of Europe\u2014and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture and city planning they sponsored. In addition to Caravaggio and Bernini, whose clay models will be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the fall, we will study (among others) Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. During the first weeks of the semester, students will present short biographies of a number of the outstanding personalities of the Counter Reformation and Baroque, from saints to nobles to prelates. Particular stress will be placed on those messages, religious and secular, that were specifically expressed in the rebuilding of the ancient and early Christian city of Rome and its monuments, including such magisterial works as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, along with many city squares, churches, monasteries, villas and palaces. These remarkable monuments of art and architecture will provide the subjects for the substantial term papers required for the course at the end of the term.     GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles (London and Chicago 1986).      The Writer in New York      (FRSEM-UA 367; class #8879)   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.     VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content (2002). His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, the Nation, the New York Times Magazine, and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.      Welcome to College: The Novel      (FRSEM-UA 371; class #7083)   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we will read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We will discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students will write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.     CAROL STERNHELL, the Department of Journalism\u2019s former Associate Chair, is Associate Professor of Journalism and a director of the Arthur L.

Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies      (FRSEM-UA 377; class #8167)   Instructor: Liana Theodoratou   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The mythic figure of Medea has held our imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present in order to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.     LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.

The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right      (FRSEM-UA 379; class #7084)   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester.     MICHAEL E. MAKOVER, M.D., is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine, Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center, and in active practice of internal medicine and rheumatology.

New York City: A Survey, 1609\u20131898      (FRSEM-UA 383; class #7086)   Instructor: Leo Hershkowitz   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12 p.m.     In this study of New York City, we shall look for answers to several basic questions. For example, how did the city become the \u201cWorld\u2019s Capital\u201d? Why is New York so different from other American cities? Why is it the center of art, music, finance, science? Is New York an American city? How have artists, writers, and travelers viewed New York? How do New Yorkers see New York? What is its future? This is also a voyage into unknown New York by means of archival sources largely overlooked by historians, but which are important to understanding the complexity, as well as the excitement, that is New York history. Many of these primary sources are now in the Tamiment Library at NYU, while others are at the New York Historical Society and such city agencies as the offices of the County Clerk, the Municipal Archives, and Register of New York County. The materials found there are basic to the lectures, discussions, and students\u2019 papers in the class. There will also be a walking tour of lower Manhattan and visits to a number of institutions where archival materials are housed.     LEO HERSHKOWITZ, Professor of History at Queens College, CUNY, has written widely on aspects of New York City history. His work has also included testimony before the U.S. Supreme Court (1997) and consultancy to the New York Attorney General, the County Clerk of New York County, and the Appellate Division of the State of New York, First Department.

He received a Ph.D. in history from New York University and a Doctorate of Humane Letters from the Hebrew Union College, Jewish Institute of Religion.      Computational Thought      (FRSEM-UA 385; class #7087)   Instructor: Dennis Shasha   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience     Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style will combine straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students will make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, evolutionarily inspired robots, DNA computing, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.     DENNIS E. SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science. His fields of research include computational biology, technologically enhanced privacy, and pattern matching. On the way to becoming a computer scientist, he studied linguistics, engineering, and philosophy. You can find some of his puzzles on the Scientific American website : www.sciam.com .      Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine &amp; Other Sources      (FRSEM-UA 393; class #7089)   Instructor: Michele Shedlin   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we will focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This will guide our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students will become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort.      MICHELLE SHEDLIN, Ph.D., Professor, NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care.

She maintains adjunct faculty appointments at Columbia University, University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Connecticut. Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.      America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II      (FRSEM-UA 405; class #7094)   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950. Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than 60-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the  insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.

Branding: People, Places, Things      (FRSEM-UA 422; class #7096)   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     As thinking people, we want to believe that we are resistant to branding and its most obvious tool, advertising. Yet both penetrate: occasionally honestly, sometimes deviously, often entertainingly. How do they do it, even when our guards are up? Why do we revere Apple, feel wary of American Apparel, admire Google, and resent BP? Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us, and companies often don\u2019t really know what works, or how; sometimes, they are just lucky. Brands also have a darker side, according to some social commentators, and may lead to mass consumer hypnosis. This course analyzes what makes brands tick, how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and politicians, taking a short look back at the creation of \u201cObama Nation\u201d and a long look back to 1968, when many of today\u2019s tools were developed. We then cross the moat to our own lives, asking ourselves: how are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own reputations; that is, our own \u201cbrands\u201d?     RICHARD L.LEWIS is an independent marketing doctor who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, leading the ABSOLUT vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.      Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music, Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition      (FRSEM-UA 427; class # 7097)   Instructor: Gary Marcus   Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     A look at music and video games from the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music? Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel experiment.     GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader ; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .      Trials of the Century      (FRSEM-UA 434; class #7100)   Instructor: Jack Ford   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the \u201cScottsboro Boys,\u201d will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the \u201cChicago Seven.\u201d And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial.\u201d Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law.     JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School.

History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.      (FRSEM-UA 437; class #7102)   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.     This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.

He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.      The \u201cLong 19th Century\u201d: Sixty Glorious Years, 1876\u20131936      (FRSEM-UA 439; class #13806)   Instructor: Rena Mueller   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The historical narrative of the \u201clong century,\u201d as defined by British historian Eric Hobsbawm, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. But this idea of the \u201clong century\u201d when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, the period from 1876 to 1936 is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition\u2014and frequently unruly first performances\u2014of Schoenberg\u2019s Second String Quartet, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Berg, Webern, and Bart\u00f3k. Richard Strauss\u2019s operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with L\u00e9har\u2019s The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus\u2019s The Chocolate Soldier , among others.   This class will explore the \u201cisms\u201d most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes\u2014musical musical evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety\u2014will form the core of the class. In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \u201cfin-de-si\u00e8cle\u201d) and Paris (the positive \u201cla belle \u00c9poque\u201d), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Br\u00fccke, the Bauhaus, the Fauves, L\u2019art nouveau, and Cubism.

Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature      (FRSEM-UA 440; class # 7103)   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Monday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through the study of stories, novels, nonfiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the 20th century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme.

Three Moments in Witchcraft      (FRSEM-UA 441; class #7104)   Instructor: Laura Levine   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     In I Samuel 28, when King Saul wants to know what to do about the army of Philistines gathering at his door, he seeks out the witch of Endor to conjure up the dead Samuel to answer his questions. Renaissance commentators puzzled over what it is that the witch summoned up: a devil? The real Samuel? \u201cAn illusion\u201d says Reginald Scot in his Discoverie, the first book in the period to offer a theory of witch-hunts as scapegoating. For him, the witch of Endor was a ventriloquist. King James I of England also saw the scene as one of theater, but for him it was the devil playing Samuel. What lies at the root of the association between witchcraft and theater during the period? When Spenser has his heroes in Book I of The Faerie Queene strip the witch Duessa to look at her naked body, how is he commenting on the theatricality of judicial procedures? Why does The Winter\u2019s Tale \u2019s Leontes throw Paulina out of his chambers as a \u201cmankind witch\u201d? This course seeks to answer such questions, beginning with the Bible, focusing on the Renaissance and ending with the story of a mouse who was a witch and Balanchine\u2019s re-creation of the moment as a ballet.     LAURA LEVINE is an Associate Professor of Theater Studies in Drama at Tisch, where she teaches courses in Shakespeare, Renaissance studies, and autobiography and solo performance.

Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 442; class #16512)   Instructor: William Klein   Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as it did in the case of Galileo)? Are there truths that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, and \u017di\u017eek.     WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of The Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of political discourse in Liberal Studies, and conducts seminars on a variety of topics for the honors program in CAS. He is currently writing a study on the history and theory of sedition. In previous lives he worked as a ghost writer, an editor and a carpenter (hence the title of a recent piece on one of Italy's great artists, Franca Ghitti: \"Naive Notes on Franca's Nails by a Former Carpenter\"). In 2011-12 he taught for NYU in Florence.       Financial Systems as Social Forms: Comparing Conventional and Islamic Finance      (FRSEM-UA 444; class #8203)   Instructor: Mary Poovey   Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Financial systems direct the flow of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also reflect and help shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. In this course we compare and contrast the theories implicit in the financial systems of the United States and most other Western countries and those implicit in  Islamic financial institutions, which now exist in many parts of the world. The most basic distinction between the two systems involves assumptions about the economy and the individuals who participate in it. In the US, the economy is assumed to govern itself by the law of supply and demand, and individuals are assumed to be rational agents who seek to maximize their own profit and minimize personal loss. Credit\u2014and therefore debt\u2014is central to the US economy because interest-based financing is the primary mechanism for transferring money from one party to another.      In Islamic finance, by contrast, commercial transactions are governed by Shari\u2019ah law because the economy, like every other facet of life, is subject to the commands of Allah and because human reason is considered fallible. While Shari\u2019ah law bans one fundamental part of the US system\u2014interest\u2014it does recognize the principle of profit and loss sharing, and special financial instruments have been developed to enable individuals and institutions to form partnerships, transfer capital, and generate profits.      By comparing these two systems and the practices they require, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in an increasingly interconnected global context.       MARY POOVEY is the Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities and Professor of English at New York University. She received a Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence from the College, and she was also recognized for excellence in teaching by Swarthmore College.

This course grows out of her current project, which is a co-authored book exploring the ways financial instruments and institutions shape the ways their users understand themselves and interact with the world.      From St. Petersburg to Paris and New York: George Balanchine and the Politics of Modernism      (FRSEM-UA 445; class #8204)   Instructor: Jennifer Homans   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course is a biography of modernism, told through the life and work of the ballet master George Balanchine. We trace Balanchine\u2019s path and artistic development from his birth in Imperial St. Petersburg in 1904 through the political and artistic tumult of the Russian Revolution, to Paris in the 1920s, where he collaborated with Serge Diaghilev and artists, dancers, and composers working at the forefront of modernism. From 1933 until his death in 1983, Balanchine lived in New York, where he and other \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists transformed the cultural life of the city. What did Balanchine\u2019s dances have to do with the political culture of Petersburg, Paris and New York? Can we trace the relationship between his life and his art?     Readings will range from history to memoir and biography. Students will also attend live performances and study dances and other forms of art at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim Museum of Art. Grades will be based on weekly writing assignments, class participation, and an in-class presentation analyzing a dance or other work of art in its historical context.     JENNIFER HOMANS is the author of Apollo\u2019s Angels: A History of Ballet (2010) and the dance critic for the New Republic . She has also published with the New York Times, the New York Review of Books , and the Guardian , among others.

Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature      (FRSEM-UA 449; class #13813)   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Phillip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.     EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School and is also an attorney specializing in Corporate Restructuring.      \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better      (FRSEM-UA 456; class #8256)   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     At a time when many Americans have become increasingly frustrated with what government has produced, there are places that are getting it done right. Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.

Mr. Gioia holds a B.A. from New York University and a J.D. from Georgetown University Law Center.      Literature, Economics, and History in 18th-Century Britain      (FRSEM-UA 460; class #8941)   Instructor: Kevin Brine   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Few authors have had more influence on modern thought than Adam Smith, Samuel Johnson, and Edward Gibbon. Smith defined the terms by which we understand modern economics; Johnson taught us how to read English literature; and Gibbon pointed the way to modern historiography with an account of the Roman Empire that has never been surpassed. All three were members of the same Literary Club, founded by Johnson and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. In 1791, Club member James Boswell published the remarkable biography Life of Johnson , which vividly portrays the intellectual life of Georgian Britain through an astounding wealth of anecdotes, intellectual repartee, and the personal details of an unforgettable and larger-than- life Samuel Johnson. In this course we read selections from Life of Johnson , Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations (1776), and Gibbon\u2019s The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (1776), with an eye toward the contemporary relevance of these works. Students come to know Samuel Johnson as though he were a family friend, gain a deep understanding of Adam Smith\u2019s concept of how a modern economy works, and see the ancient grandeur of Rome through the eyes of one of the world\u2019s most influential historians. Working in small groups, students learn to present their ideas in a seminar setting and improve their writing skills with assignments geared toward expressing their ideas and insights.     KEVIN R.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber      (FRSEM-UA 461; class #8960)   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English.     JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

Oral History of Irish America      (FRSEM-UA 462; class #8971)   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. -12:00 noon    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to documenting the lived experience of Irish Americans and their communities in a small class setting. The course reviews the methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the opportunity to create an original public history document that will be deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by scholars in a variety of research projects. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen from the Irish American community in New York City. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an Oscar and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director, a National Book Award-winning novelist, as well as actors, musicians, teachers, and Wall Street executives. In addition to the interview, the course includes classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises. The final project (which will undergo careful editing and numerous rewrites) includes a biography and full finding aid to the interview for the archive, as well as web content that will be launched on the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History website. This course offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers.     LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America.

Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.      Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\"      (FRSEM-UA 463; class #14260)   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.      SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later).

He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA).      Literature of the Absurd      (FRSEM-UA 464; class #14251)   Instructor: Thomas Bishop   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The absurd sensibility has profoundly marked writers of many countries and languages since the start of the 20th century. The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950's in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued world-wide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, Stoppard, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post-World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of human\u2019s condition on this earth and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the landmark Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages [which were] swept away\u2026found wanting\u2026and discredited.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary and the seminal depiction of the absurd for his century; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertesz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, and more recently, Woody Allen. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, an era that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and with it human\u2019s ability for the first time of destroying itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd would be a dominant stance, even if the absurd if often treated with devastating humor.   TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature, and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization.

Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel      (FRSEM-UA 466; class #14269)   Instructor: Ilya Kriger   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we will try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, will be supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others.      ILYA KLIGER is assistant professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explores the parallel developments of the notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.      The Statue of Liberty: Icon of America      (FRSEM-UA 467; class #14253)   Instructor: Edward Berenson   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most beloved of all American symbols. Yet no one living in 1885, when the crated monument arrived in New York Harbor, could have foreseen the central place the Statue of Liberty would come to occupy in the American imagination. Most Americans had never heard of the French intellectuals who proposed to build it, and many thought the whole idea presumptuous and bizarre. The statue\u2019s supporters feared it would never go up. The course will begin with Liberty\u2019s uncertain origins in French art and politics and then consider the trials of its reception and construction in New York Harbor. We will see how the statue\u2019s symbolically indistinct, neoclassical form has allowed Americans to interpret its meaning in diverse ways: as representing the emancipation of the slaves, Tocqueville's ideal of orderly liberty, opportunity for \"huddled masses,\" and, in the years since 9/11, the freedom and resilience of the United States and New York City in the face of terror. We will also examine the statue\u2019s prominent role in American popular culture. About midway through the semester, the class will take the ferry to Liberty Island and climb to the statue\u2019s crown.     EDWARD BERENSON is professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at NYU. In 1999, he won the American Historical Association\u2019s Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award. He is the author or editor of six books, the most recent of which are Heroes of Empire: Five Charismatic Men and the Conquest of Africa (2010) and The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story (2012).       Schools in the Greek and Roman World      (FRSEM-UA 468; class #14255)   Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      This course will give students knowledge of ancient schooling in the Greek and Roman worlds and will cover liberal arts education (in its three levels, primary, grammatical, and rhetorical) and schools of medicine. Some scholars have recently maintained that the network of schools in the ancient world was so puny that the levels of illiteracy were extremely high. Yet it is important to take into account that it is difficult to identify schools because they were usually not housed in buildings designated for this purpose, often occupied private quarters, and education went on in the open air or within the family. At the end of the course students will realize that much caution is needed in evaluating education in the ancient world.     The course will be based on the literary sources, the school exercises from Greek and Roman Egypt, and on archaeological sources. Students will examine evidence regarding schools that have recently come to light in Rome and Greek Alexandria. They will pay special attention to the Greek school found in Egypt in the Dakhla Oasis through the excavation sponsored by New York University.     RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is a professor in the Department of Classics and is considered an expert in ancient education. His first book was Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt (Scholars Press 1996), which contained a catalogue of 406 school exercises that emerged from the sands of Egypt. This book was followed by Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt (Princeton 2001). This book was awarded the Goodwin Prize in 2003, the most prestigious award in the field of Classics. In 2006, Professor Cribiore wrote, in collaboration with Roger Bagnall, Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (Michigan University Press). In 2007 he published again with Princeton University Press The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , which studied a very prestigious school of rhetoric in Syria.      Pagans and Christians in Roman Egypt      (FRSEM-UA 469; class #14256)   Instructor: Nicola Aravecchia   Friday, 9:30-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This course explores the subject of paganism in late Roman Egypt and the role that Christianity played in shaping a new religious, social, and cultural environment between the third and sixth centuries CE. The goal is to gain an understanding of the process by which the new religion spread in a heavily Hellenized part of the Mediterranean world, influenced by Classical culture and religious beliefs but also attached to its traditional religious heritage. The seminar will touch upon issues of religious and cultural resistance, imperial involvement, official propaganda, proselytism, and syncretic manifestations of devotional practice. Attention will also be paid to the variety of forms in which Christianity (and modes of Christian life) developed in Egypt, expressive of a complex but deeply fascinating world of ideas and beliefs. The religious topography of pre-Christian Egypt, in which temples were prime visual landmarks, will be examined and compared with the dramatic changes brought by the appearance and dissemination of Christian places of cult and monastic life.     NICOLA ARAVECCHIA is Clinical Assistant Professor of Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and the academic director of New York University\u2019s semester abroad program in Egypt. His research interests concern Egypt in Late Antiquity and focus on the origins and development of Early Christian art and architecture in that region of the Mediterranean world. He also has a strong interest in the application of models of spatial analysis to archaeology, with the goal of studying how public and private spaces were constructed and used in antiquity and how they affected social relationships. He is the field director of the archaeological mission of Ain el-Gedida, a fourth-century settlement in the Dakhla Oasis of Upper Egypt, where he has been excavating since 2006. Currently, he is working on the final archaeological report of the 2006-2008 excavation seasons. He is also the deputy field director of the archaeological mission of Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis.      Picasso: Poetry and Invention      (FRSEM-UA 470; class #14257)   Instructor: Pepe Karmel   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Pablo Picasso is widely recognized as the greatest artist of the 20th century. But what is it that makes his work so powerful and influential? This seminar will explore Picasso\u2019s achievement in depth, looking at paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints from all eight decades of his career. On one hand, we will look at the astonishing series of new formal languages that he invented between 1907 through 1957. On the other, we will look at Picasso\u2019s remarkable work as a figurative storyteller and poet, exploring the fundamental human emotions of joy and sorrow, love and desire, alienation and aggression. Along with texts by biographers, critics, and art historians, we will read works by poets such as, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, and Paul Eluard,who were his closest friends.      PEPE KARMEL teaches in the Department of Art History, New York University. His book, Picasso and the Invention of Cubism , was published by Yale University Press in 2003.

He is currently working on a history of abstract art.       A Nation of War      (FRSEM-UA 471; class #14398)   Instructor: Nikhil Singh   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore a controversial proposition: to what extent is the US a nation defined by commitments to and capacities for making war? Coming of age in the years since 9/11, many of you will not have known a time when the nation was not at war.      We will explore societal interests and attitudes that sustain an interest in war. For example, wars are commonly presented to the general public as necessary to preserve security, and ironically as a means toward peace. In the 1950s President Eisenhower warned of the rise of a \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d that grew independent of any strategic or security interest. Some have argued that recent wars have been motivated by struggles over resources, particularly oil.      In the contemporary moment, publics are shielded from the consequences of war and thus may have different perspectives from combatants, soldiers and casualties of war. Wars can both unify a people and sharpen domestic political conflicts and societal divisions.      We will use selected course readings and documentary screenings to explore a range of social, philosophical and personal standpoints on America\u2019s wars past, present and future in an effort to answer an age-old question: \u201cwar, what is it good for?\u201d     NIKHIL PAL SINGH is Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History. He is a recent winner of NYU\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. teaching award.

He is the author of the prize-winning book, Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy , and is currently completing a work entitled Exceptional Empire: Race and War in US Globalism .      21st Century Literature: Methods, Materials, Maps      (FRSEM-UA 473; class #14399)   Instructor: Elaine Freedgood   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will read a selection of novels, poetry, and journalism written in the last twelve years that will help us explore the issues raised in the course\u2019s subtitle: \u201cmethods, materials and maps.\u201d The methods writers use in the twenty-first century to depict internal and external worlds, including realism, postmodernism, digital operations of chance and data mining, and poetry deviate significantly from our ideas of the lyric and the personal. Materials include illustrations\u2014the graphic novel and the comic, the artist\u2019s book, electronic media, and self-published zines. What is the geography of current world literature? What is global and/or local about it? The course will include \u201cfield trips\u201d to poetry and prose readings, book stores, and exhibits of printed and digital matter. Writers will include Indra Sinha, Chris Ware, Young Hae-Chang, Orhan Pamuk, Maureen McLane, Ian MacEwan, Karenn Tei Yamashita, Jesmyn Ward, Dexter Filkins, and Ed Roberson.      ELAINE FREEDGOOD is the author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (Cambridge 2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago 2006), and also the editor of Factory Production in Victorian Britain (Oxford 2003). She is currently working on a book about fictionality, reference and metalepsis.      What is College For?      (FRSEM-UA 474; class #14400)   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It will also prompt you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the 21st century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we will study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment?     TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.      Why Lincoln Matters: Re-Envisioning the Politically Possible      (FRSEM-UA 475; class #14401)   Instructor: Philip Kunhardt   Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How was a man with less than a year of formal education able to become one of the nation\u2019s most salient political actors? Coinciding with the 2012 presidential election, and with the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, this seminar will involve students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American presidencies. In an effort to understand why his memory still matters, and what contemporary political leaders can learn from his example, we will examine Lincoln\u2019s core writings and speeches for historical context, literary and political merit, and impact on the thinking of the American public. We will look at Lincoln\u2019s role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric, and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How was he influenced by other figures around him\u2014southerners, abolitionists, former slaves, and social conservatives? And how did he learn to use words so effectively to help produce social transformation? Lessons and warnings applicable to today will enter into our intensive group discussion. In papers and presentations students will examine aspects of presidential leadership of most interest to them and develop their writing and communication skills. In addition to Lincoln\u2019s published words, drawn from Roy Basler, Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings , texts will include David H. Donald, Lincoln ; Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial: Lincoln and Slavery ; ibid, Our Lincoln ; James Oakes, The Radical and the Republican ; Douglas Wilson, Honor\u2019s Voice ; and ibid, Lincoln\u2019s Sword . Students may also read a book on the American presidency as an institution, and on Barack Obama and/or his opposing candidate in the 2012 elections.

Swing Counties 2012: The Bush-Obama America      (FRSEM-UA 479; class #16513)   Instructor: David Dent   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     George Bush and Barack Obama are two very different leaders. Yet they have 272 counties in common. George Bush won those counties in 2000 and 2004 and Barack Obama won them in 2008. This course explores American politics and the electoral process through the prism of swing counties and voters. How do such voters and counties exist in this age of ideological polarization? Readings will include Dreams from My Father, Red State Blue State , among other articles and books that explore swing voters. Students will write two Op Ed pieces related to the concept of swing voters and complete a final project.      DAVID J.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law      (FRSEM-UA 480; class #16699)   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What's the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments.

Cannibalism      (FRSEM-UA 481; class # 16700)   Instructor: Dylon Robbins   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Western thought teaches us that people who eat people are \u201cbad.\u201d Indeed, the notion of cannibalism is a recurring concern in the history of ideas regarding the primitive, the animalistic, the monstrous, or any of the other classifications frequently invoked to mark others, regardless of their actual culinary preferences. An extended reflection on cannibalism as an intellectual phenomenon suggests how people eating people, or at least the possibility of it, says a great deal about those that do not. Interesting, as well, is the fact that, in some regions of the Caribbean and Brazil, ideas regarding cannibalism have made an important turn, such that the cannibal has become a provocative affirmation of self. The aim of this course is to think about cannibalism, not, as it often is, as a theme for anthropologists and ethnographers, but rather as an intellectual problem that has enjoyed a very long life in the history of ideas about self. In this course, we shall revisit a selection of texts regarding cannibalism from Columbus\u2019 diaries to the present, and including many noteworthy and fascinating interventions about the idea of cannibalism by, among others, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Cabeza de Vaca, Hans Staden, Goya, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, Oswald de Andrade, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.     DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular interest in the cultural and theoretical production of these regions, in addition to that of the African Diasporas in general, with particular concern for intellectual and cultural histories, media, cinema, and popular music. His work is supported by archival research in Brazil as a Fulbright-Hays fellow at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros, and in Cuba at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. He is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.      Audiovisual Stories: Creative Documentary Filmmaking in Latin America (2000\u20132012)      (FRSEM-UA 483; class #17048)   Instructor: Alexandra Falek   Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Creative documentaries present their subject in a poetic manner; they experiment with the formal and conceptual possibilities of storytelling by proposing an artistic engagement and (re)presentation of the questions, problems and ideas they explore. In Latin America, they are a vital part of long-standing film traditions. This seminar offers students the opportunity to acquire practical and perceptive skills related to the interpretation and analysis of recent creative documentaries made by renowned and new directors. We will examine the use and construction of storytelling elements (visual, aural, emotional, narrative, structural) in each film, always considering pertinent issues related to the film\u2019s particular production, exhibition and distribution contexts. As a way of building a strong foundation for the notions of \u201ccreativity\u201d and \u201cpoetry\u201d in filmmaking, we will make regular reference to seminal essays on classic documentary approaches and strategies. Students will develop critical proficiency by watching films on a regular basis, reading relevant texts by filmmakers, theorists and critics, and writing short exercises and a final project.     ALEXANDRA FALEK has been teaching at NYU since 2001 in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Languages and Literatures, first as a doctoral student and since 2008, as an Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow. She was the co-director of Latin American Film Festival at NYU (2011) and the director of Uruguay Film Fest (2011). Her most recent teaching, research and publication explorations focus on documentary filmmaking in Latin America.      Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 484; class #17214)   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship \u2013 the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics will include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of how New York City is an international city that has turned diversity into strength. The seminar will bring in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions \u2013 ranging from activism to business leadership \u2013 may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? How do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? As part of the seminar we will travel to NYU\u2019s Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center in Washington, D.C., to visit an international organization, NGO, or federal agency that is engaged globally.

He has published widely on photography and co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice, cross-listed in four NYU departments and two schools.      See It, Read It: Photography and Writing in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 486; class #17131)   Instructor: Lourdes D\u00e1vila   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What is a photograph? How do we read photographs? How has photography shaped history and fiction, our ideas of the self and of others? The purpose of this course is to analyze the history of photography and its relation with textual productions in XX and XXI century Latin American writers. We will begin by studying how the technology of photography (which arrived in Latin America almost simultaneously with its creation in Europe) contributed to a particular visual construction of Latin America and was incorporated into literary writings from the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern Cone. The main objective of the course will be to analyze the use of photography in literary and extra-literary texts, from texts that use photography as its discursive axis (but without containing real photographs) to texts that play on the page with photographic reproductions. Topics includ: photography and history, photography and archive, photography and madness, photography and the city, photography and memory, and photography and eroticism. We will consider texts and photographs by Roberto Arlt, Leopoldo Lugones, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Elena Poniatowska, Mario Bellatin, Ana Mar\u00eda Berecochea, and Paz Err\u00e1zuriz, among others. As we explore how literary authors manipulate photographs on the page or collaborate with photographers, we will look at other international writers, such as W. G. Sebald. This course will count toward the major in Spanish and Latin American Studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.     LOURDES D\u00c1VILA is a member of the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese and a Golden Dozen Teaching Award winner. Since the 1980s, she has written and published widely on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s writing, from Hopscotch to Buenos Aires Buenos Aires to Fantomas Against the Multinational Vampires . Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , focuses on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s use of visual language. She is is finishing a book on photography and literature in Latin America, is the editor of the forthcoming essay collection La variable Bellatin , and has worked as a translator since the early eighties, both in the field of art and in literature. Her two latest literary translations are Corner of the Dead , (English to Spanish), a short novel by award-winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Silvalandia (Spanish to English).       The Past\u2019s Presence      (FRSEM-UA 487; class #17132)   Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How do we remember the past? And what do we learn from it? This course will take up questions of remembering, reflecting on, and writing the past through three lenses. We will begin the semester by reading a selection of African American authors who recast narratives of slavery in contemporary literature. Reading these \u201cneo-slave narratives\u201d will allow us to think about the ways history can be retold in imaginative ways and to explore the complex relationship between nostalgia and critique embodied in the return to the sites of slavery. We will also read works of narrative history and \u201cexperimental\u201d history as a way to think through what counts as meaningful scholarship, whether literary or historical. Finally, students will embark on hands-on research projects of their own design, viewing the past through the authors, texts, locations or institutions that can be recovered by examining primary and archival sources available digitally and/or in New York City. This is a course for those interested in honing their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers, and for those interested in the process of reading, research and writing, their joys and their frustrations.     ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction. She is the recipient of fellowships from the Ford Foundation and the National Humanities Center, and is currently a co-editor of the New York University Press series, America and the Long Nineteenth Century . Her research interests and teaching are primarily focused on American and African American literary history, print culture studies, and archival research methods.       Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism      (FRSEM-UA 488; class #17133)   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course will study the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied 17th century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential.     WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.      Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis      (FRSEM-UA 489; class #17139)   Instructor: Katherine Smith   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses.     KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, Katherine's dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Katherine spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity. An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. Katherine is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled In Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art, which will open in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.      Feeling Beauty: Aesthetics and Cognitive Science      (FRSEM-UA 492; class # 17191)   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Monday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Why do the arts\u2014as diverse as they are in form and in the modes by which they appeal to body and mind\u2014move us as powerfully as they do? This course explores this question from three perspectives: from that of the philosophical tradition of aesthetics, from that of cognitive neuroscience, and from the that of the arts themselves. Students will read Plato, Kant, Burke, Keats, Elizabeth Bishop, as well as work by neuroscientists, and will engage works of music and of visual art.     G. Gabrielle Starr is Associate Professor of English and Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the  aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.       SPRING 2013       Word and Image      (FRSEM-UA 399; class # 12920)   Instructor: Mark Podwal   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 10:00-11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem, I Paint What I See, parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and a Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits will be assigned.     MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For 38 years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast this year on PBS.      Drama Criticism: In History and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 459, class # 12923)   Instructor: Ethan Youngerman   Thursday, 2:00 \u2013 4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play's production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York's newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history.     ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is the Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College and a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where he's won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the faculty a decade ago. He's also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including: Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play, The Sublet Experiment , ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from The New York Times, The AP, New York Magazine and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU.                           The Early History of God      (FRSEM-UA 472; class # 12927)   Instructor: Mark Smith   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     Like other areas of human life and experience, gods and goddesses are complex phenomena, requiring study and thinking. This course focuses on how gods and goddesses (deities) \u2013 and divinity more broadly \u2013 were understood in ancient literatures. We will consider Gilgamesh and the Epic of Creation from Mesopotamia, Canaanite myths and legends, and Israel\u2019s Bible/Old Testament, among other texts. This course centers on the \u201cjob description\u201d of gods and goddesses (what deities are and what they have to be able to do to qualify as deities); the emotions of deities (anger, love, fear, etc.); their gender and sexuality; the animals thought to represent them (\u201cemblem animals\u201d); the various relationships of deities to one another and to humans; the divine creation of the world and of humanity; and deities in love and war. The course also addresses \"monotheism\" in ancient Israel, namely, the belief in only one god.   MARK S. SMITH holds the Skirball Chair of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale in 1985. He has served twice as Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.. He was honored as President of the Catholic Biblical Association of America in 2010-2011, and in 2011 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research. He is also a two-time winner of New York University\u2019s Golden Dozen Award and the recipient of the Frank Moore Cross award for publication awarded by the American Schools of Oriental Research. He has published over eighty articles, including first editions of four minor manuscripts from Cave Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He has authored thirteen books and co-authored three others.      Political Theater      (FRSEM-UA 476; class # 12940)   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective on these questions. In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, students will learn about the development of different dramatic techniques and forms through the history of theater, about the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy, and about the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques.     ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.      Physics at Accelerators      (FRSEM-UA 477; class # 12933)   Instructor: Henry Stroke   Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     We will look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These will involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radiofrequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion will be based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion will require an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, will be introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei will lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection will be discussed, as will nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, will be among the numerous detection techniques encountered.     HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radiofrequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \"on-line\" mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible  non-zero neutrino mass.    Heloise: A Woman for the Twelfth Century      (FRSEM-UA 478; class # 12934)   Instructor: Fiona Griffiths   Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      Few medieval women have been so often studied and yet so little understood as Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete (d. 1164). Her life, known primarily through the letters that she exchanged with her former husband, the philosopher Peter Abelard (d. 1142), offers a study in contradiction: she was an educated woman at a time when women were supposedly barred from education; a nun who, though dedicated to God, battled sexual desire; a mother, whose spiritual daughters seemingly displaced her one biological son; and a wife, whose husband became her \u201cbrother\u201d in Christ. Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine. Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard. This seminar revises the traditional image of Heloise, dignifying her as a scholar, monastic reformer, and administrator\u2014as well as a lover, wife, mother, and friend.      FIONA J. GRIFFITHS, Associate Professor in the Department of History, is a medievalist who focuses on women and gender within the monastic life from late antiquity through the thirteenth century. A Canadian by birth, she earned her PhD from Cambridge University and has received fellowships from the Institute of Historical Research (London), the National Endowment for the Humanities, Harvard University, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung.      Comparative Revisionism in Historical Writing      (FRSEM-UA 482; class # 12935)   Instructor: Joe Lee   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      'Revisionist' and 'Revisionism' are two of the most widely used terms in recent historical discourse to describe particular types of historical writing. They are used as terms of praise, criticism, and abuse. This course seeks to explore the modalities of thought of both revisionists and their critics by looking at a number of case-studies in comparative historical perspective, striving to locate them in their particular historical circumstances and conjunctures. Case studies concerning specific controversies relating to British, German, Irish and Israeli historical writing, frequently involving foreign, including American, authorities in these fields, will be analyzed to determine what general conclusions, if any, can be deduced concerning modalities of historical thought.     JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU. He was previously at University College Cork (Ireland), where he chaired the History Department and served for periods as Dean of Arts and as Vice President. He is a former Member of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament and former Member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body; he also served as the Chair of the Fulbright Commission for Ireland and as President of the Irish Association for European Studies. He is author of seminal histories of Ireland, The Modernization of Irish Society, 1848-1918 and the prize-winning Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society . His op-ed columns for the Sunday Tribune were collected as The Shifting Balance of Power: Exploring the 20th Century , and he recently co-edited Making the Irish American: The History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States with Marion R. Casey.      American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820-2012      (FRSEM-UA 485; class # 12936)   Instructor: Beth Machlan   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Thursday, 9:30 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.     This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cPanic Room,\u201d and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11.     BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU.

Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts      (FRSEM-UA 490; class # 12937)   Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons   Class meetings: Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We will examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students will visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art.

The Cultural Work of Play      (FRSEM-UA 491; class # 12938)   Instructor: Louis Bury   Class Meetings: Tuesdays, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note:conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      In his book Homo Ludens , Latin for \"man the player,\" Dutch historian Johan Huizinga defined play as a free and disinterested activity separate from \"real\" or \"ordinary\" life. Yet, free and disinterested as play may appear, the forms it takes and the significance participants and spectators accord to it always carries with them values. In this seminar, we will read across a wide variety of genres and disciplines in order to consider the myriad ways in which people have understood the importance of play and games to culture. As well, we will explore the extent to which work--both academic and otherwise--permits, even encourages, forms of serious play. Possible readings include: articles of the sociology of sport; articles on game theory; treatises on stadium financing and design; novels; memoirs; films; poems; works of ludic, or game-like, literature; works of literary journalism; works of art; works of history; works of anthropology; works of theory/philosophy. In addition to a final research project on the subject of play, students will be expected to compose weekly writing assignments, many of them playful in nature.     LOUIS BURY's first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (forthcoming from Dalkey Archive Press), plays with the conventions of academic writing through the use of arbitrary rules and procedures (such as a chapter written on the subway and a chapter written entirely in questions). He is currently at work on a book of creative non-fiction and cultural criticism entitled The Gym . He is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU and he holds a Ph.D. in English from the CUNY Graduate Center. During graduate school, he supported himself as a part-time professional poker player.      Women in Social Movements in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 493; class # 12939)   Instructor: Pamela Calla   Thursdays, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women's political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This will allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action in relation to their own notions of political and democratic gains and inclusion and attainment (or not) of economic, cultural, racial and gender justice vis-a-vis the state in each country examined.

The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.  Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210; class # 6771 Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on twentieth-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.  The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218; class # 6772 Instructor: John E. Sexton Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level. JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.  First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235; class # 6773   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon  syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Prerequisites: A score of 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History or in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam); a 4 or 5 on both exams (or equivalent international exams) is strongly recommended. Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions of speech and press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course, which involves study of both history and law, begins by examining the robust debate and dissent during the founding period and the struggle during that time against prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court gave meaning to the freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, where he teaches First Amendment freedom of expression. He is working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.  School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255; class # 6774   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader. ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.  Spring 2014 The Politics of Knowledge FRSEM-UA 277; class # 14596 Instructor: Thomas Bender  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. N ote: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Knowledge is power, it is said. If that is true, is there a politics of knowledge? In academe, knowledge is often contested. Is knowledge only political? What is the difference between \u201copinion\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d? The university is organized around disciplines. What is the role of academic disciplines? How is knowledge validated? Do all disciplines have the same criteria for knowledge? Are there different kinds of knowledge? Are there incommensurable knowledges? Do artists, humanists, and scientists understand knowledge and knowledge claims differently? Are visual, numerical, narrative, and analytical forms of knowing/interpreting all forms of knowledge? What is the relation of interpretation to knowledge? Is all knowledge interpretive? Is some interpretive, and other not? Is there a way to determine that some knowledge claims are truer than others? The seminar proceeds by reading and discussion and weekly \u201cresponses\u201d to readings, critical two-page papers related to some of the readings, and a short research paper. THOMAS BENDER is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History. On the faculty since 1974, he has served as chair of the History Department and Dean for the Humanities. His teaching and research interests cover the history of cities, intellectuals and cultural history more generally.

Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History FRSEM-UA 312; class # 14334 Instructor: Marion Kaplan  syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.) This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, these ego-documents reveal crucial concealed thoughts and emotions, as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with a memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher/bohemian/heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Students will study a variety of readings from the period of the Holocaust. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor assigns introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class. MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J\u00fcdischer Frauenbund, 1904\u20131938; The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany; and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany; and the co-editor of Gender and Jewish History .

Recycling Music: From Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop FRSEM-UA 319; class # 18467 Instructor: Rena Mueller  syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Sixty years ago the musical Kismet opened on Broadway, and the Russian post-Wagnerian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named as the co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin\u2019s oeuvre to construct the score, something they had done before (successfully, in The Song of Norway , to the music of Grieg) and would do again (unsuccessfully, in Anya , music by Rachmaninoff). These are among the many instances in which musicians and composers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have reached back into the past for inspiration, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and popular music. We examine representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage ( Rent, Aida ), ballet, film ( Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Alicia Keys, Eric Carmen, All By Myself, Never Gonna Fall in Love Again , Procol Harum). After a brief introduction to the concept of musical transference and the concept of parody in music (Bach, Mozart), students compare original \u201cclassical\u201d compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music and film, and examine the culture of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to its later incarnation. Classical composers/conductors and artists who were critical to this movement are also considered.  RENA CHARNIN MUELLER teaches historical musicology at New York University. She is the recipient of the Liszt Medal given by the American Liszt Society for 2011, and edited the Journal of the American Liszt Society from 2001 to 2011.

With M\u00e1ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Liszt \u201cList of Works\u201d for The New Grove 2001 , and together they are preparing a complete thematic catalogue of Liszt\u2019s music.  Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355; class # 6780 Instructor: John Maynard  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present. They learn to consider different approaches to literature. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome: Michelangelo and Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366; class # 8250 Instructor: Guy Walton  syllabus  Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Recent biographies of Michelangelo by John Spike (Young Michelangelo) and by Antonio Forcellino (Michelangelo a Tormented Life) , and of Caravaggio by Andrew Graham-Dixon (Caravaggio, a Life Sacred and Profane) , will provide the focus of this course along with contemporary writings. The course will study the remarkable papal patronage of the arts of Rome during the reigns of a number of popes, including Sixtus IV, Alexander VI, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, Clement VIII and Paul V along with other patrons close to the papal court at the time. GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles .  The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367; class # 8119 Instructor: Vincent Passaro Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy. VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, The Nation, the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.  Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371; class # 6781 Instructor: Carol Sternhell  syllabus  Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. CAROL STERNHELL, the Department of Journalism\u2019s former Associate Chair, is Associate Professor of Journalism and a director of the Arthur L.

Makover  syllabus  Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester. MICHAEL E.

Computational Thought FRSEM-UA 385; class # 6784 Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30-4:30 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a biography about great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over sixty journal papers, seventy conference papers, and fifteen patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American . Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393; class # 6785 Instructor: Michele Shedlin  syllabus  Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This guides our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort. MICHELE SHEDLIN, Professor at the NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care. Dr. Shedlin is currently involved in NIH-funded research on HIV risk for Colombian refugees in Ecuador, medication adherence among US\u2013Mexico border populations, acculturation and HIV risk for sexual minority populations and post-Katrina Latino migrant workers in New Orleans. She maintains adjunct faculty appointments at Columbia University, University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Connecticut. Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.  Spring 2014 Word and Image FRSEM-UA 399; class # 7942 Instructor: Mark Podwal  syllabus  Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem \u201cI Paint What I See\u201d parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and A Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits are assigned. MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For thirty-eight years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books, as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast in 2008 and 2010 on PBS.  America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405; class # 6786 Instructor: James B. Sitrick  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than sixty-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in America during which time that firm opened the first private law office in the then Soviet Union, in Moscow, in addition to offices in Sydney, Shanghai, Bangkok, Jakarta, Los Angeles, and San Jose. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as Secretary General of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a Trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU. Is Karl Marx Still Relevant? FRSEM-UA 413; class # 14944 Instructor: Jeff Goodwin  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, students in this course critically examine some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto, The German Ideology, The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current U.S. politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. His has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader, Contention in Context, Passionate Politics, and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422; class # 6787 Instructor: Richard L. Lewis  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Brands are red hot and understanding branding is, too. Just what is it and why do people now want to possess personal brands? And what exactly is a brand, say, versus a product? Brands can be magical, prosaic, living or dead. And while companies manicure them it\u2019s up to us, the audience, to determine if they are successful. Brands can be great time-savers: it\u2019s reassuring a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust. They provide information, advice, smiles, and community. They live, breathe, grow, and sometimes (deservedly) die. Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even the brand owners sometimes don\u2019t really know what the glue is that cements the relationships with their audiences. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, the ingredients, the evolution\u2014how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and presidents. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. The course will also examine our budding, personal brands because through our reputations\u2014or brands\u2014our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us. How are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own brands? Branding is a course that provides insight into our everyday lives. Consider it a marketing course for the rest of us. RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/ Day, leading the ABSOLUT Vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.  The Science and Policy of Climate Change FRSEM-UA 432; class # 15018 Instructor: Edwin Gerber  syllabus  Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Hurricane Sandy. The Keystone XL pipeline. Fracking. The topic of climate change continues to inject itself into headlines, despite the reluctance of Washington to have a genuine conversation on the topic. Climate change provokes heated argument not only because of the great environmental, economic, and political implications, but also how it injects itself into our daily lives on such a personal level, impacted each time we flip a switch, decide what's for dinner, or connect on Facebook. Each Google search adds roughly 0.2 grams of carbon to the atmosphere; a harmless sounding number, except for the fact that collectively the world makes about 5 billion searches each day ... and that number is growing fast! To help you make informed decisions about climate change, this course explores the science of global warming. We investigate the evidence from observations and the physical and mathematical foundations upon which forecasts of future climate are based. What are the key uncertainties in the predictions, and what steps are required to reduce them? Armed with this scientific basis, you then conduct your own research project on the economic and policy side of climate change, giving you a chance to enter the debate, and perhaps contribute to the solution! EDWIN GERBER is a Professor of Atmosphere-Ocean Science at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. His research focuses on the natural variability of the Earth's atmosphere (for example, why are some winters so cold and snowy compared to others?) and the role it plays in the response of the climate system to anthropogenic (human) forcing. More recently he has investigated how the formation of the ozone hole changed the circulation of the Southern Hemisphere, with possible implications for the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets and global sea level rise. Trials of the Century FRSEM-UA 434; class # 6789 Instructor: Jack Ford  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the Scottsboro Boys, will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the Chicago Seven. And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes Monkey Trial. Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law. JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, Mr. Ford most recently served as the Anchor of Jack Ford: Courtside on COURT TV, which he helped launch in 1991. He has also served as Chief Legal Correspondent on NBC News and as an Anchor/ Correspondent for ABC News. As a trial attorney, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial, one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases, and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s, and authored a number of articles for respected legal publications. He is the recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service work.  History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S. FRSEM-UA 437; class # 6790 Instructor: Jack Salzman  syllabus  Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory. JACK SALZMAN has been the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching award and two Fulbright Professorships. He formerly served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University, and for thirty years was the editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the five-volume Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.  Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature FRSEM-UA 440; class # 6791 Instructor: Saul Rosenberg  syllabus  Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Through the study of stories, novels, non-fiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later nineteenth century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the twentieth century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme. SAUL ROSENBERG, who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He has also been a consultant at McKinsey and Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he now manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal . Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present FRSEM-UA 442; class # 8752 Instructor: William Klein  syllabus  Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state and beyond? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as in the case of Galileo)? Are there types of truth that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, Negri and Zizek. WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of ideas in Liberal Studies, and has taught in the Freshman Honors Seminar program since 2003. He is currently writing a study of the history and theory of sedition and has also published works of fiction and art criticism. Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449; class # 8253 Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld  syllabus  Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War\u2013era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history. EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today. ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council.

Spring 2014 Drama Criticism: In History and Practice FRSEM-UA 459, class # 7943 Instructor: Ethan Youngerman Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play\u2019s production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York\u2019s newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history. ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is a Senior Language Lecturer and Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College; he has won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the Expository Writing Program over a decade ago. He and his wife Rebecca were recently appointed Faculty Fellows in Residence. Ethan is also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including the Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play The Sublet Experiment ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from the New York Times , the Associated Press, New York magazine, and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461; class # 8167 Instructor: Jing Wang  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the eighteenth century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center, the novel intimately explores questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility and the excesses and decadence of the privileged, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original are advised to choose another Freshman Honors Seminar and take reading the Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. The readings and discussion for EAST-UA 228 are in Chinese, making this course more suitable for native speakers. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites.

Oral History of Irish America FRSEM-UA 462; class # 8170 Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida  syllabus  Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Long before the technology of today's social media, cultures, families and individuals shared their personal and community stories in an oral tradition that preserved the past for future generations. We will examine the discipline and evolution of oral history using the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History of Irish America Collection to explore how aural memory contributes to the historical record and shapes the identity of individuals and communities. This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, as well as specific interviewing and research techniques. Students will gain access to our Archive of Irish America and have the opportunity to work with the interviews we have already deposited, including how the university\u2019s digital mapping technology can be applied in our analysis of the archive. Students will also have the chance to conduct an interview themselves..The course comprises classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises;. it offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers. LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Specializing in twentieth-century immigration, Professor Almeida has focused primarily on the \u201cNew Irish\u201d of the 1980s and 90s, publishing chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006). Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compared those who arrived in the 1950s with their counterparts thirty and forty years later. She has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives. Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d FRSEM-UA 463; class # 8365 Instructor: Shimon Dotan  syllabus  Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA). Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel FRSEM-UA 466; class # 8370 Instructor: Ilya Kliger  syllabus  Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. In this course we examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience, and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, are supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others. ILYA KLIGER is Assistant Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explored parallel developments in notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.  What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474; class # 8401 Instructor: Trace Jordan  syllabus   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It also prompts you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally\u2014 and most importantly\u2014how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment? TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Physics at Accelerators FRSEM-UA 477; class # 16309 Instructor: Henry Stroke  syllabus  Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radio frequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion is based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion requires an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, are introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection are discussed, as well as nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, are among the numerous detection techniques encountered. HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radio frequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \u201con-line\u201d mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible non-zero neutrino mass.  Gender, Sexuality and the Law FRSEM-UA 480; class # 8766 Instructor: Shelley Fischel  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What\u2019s the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments. SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her J.D. from Columbia University and her L.L.M. from NYU.            Spring 2014 Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice FRSEM-UA 484; class # 14990 Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? And how do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma , editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 , and editor and translator of The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke . He has published widely on photography and co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice, cross-listed in four NYU departments and two schools.  Spring 2014 American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820\u20132012 FRSEM-UA 485; class # 7948 Instructor: Beth Machlan  syllabus  Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to Buffy the Vampire Slayer , have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like Rosemary\u2019s Baby and Panic Room , and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11. BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories. Her academic work has appeared in Studies in the Novel , Representing Segregation , and the Los Angeles Review of Books , and her essays have been featured on The Awl, The Hairpin , and The Rumpus .  Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism FRSEM-UA 488; class # 8852 Instructor: William Ambler  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the seventeenth century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied seventeenth century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential. WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.  Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis FRSEM-UA 489; class # 8853 Instructor: Katherine Smith   syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.) This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses. KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, her dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Professor Smith spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity . An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. She is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled I n Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art , which opened in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.  Spring 2014 Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts FRSEM-UA 490; class # 7949 Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art. In fall 2013 the class blogged some of its creative writing exercises at http://nyusynesthesia.tumblr.com AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and has won awards from Yale University and Open City Magazine .

Guggenheim Museum titled \u201cResponding to Art Through Creative Writing.\u201d She is a past recipient of NYU\u2019s Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from NYU.  Spring 2014 Women in Social Movements in Latin America FRSEM-UA 493; class # 7951 Instructor: Pamela Calla  syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women\u2019s political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action, based on their own notion of what constitutes political and democratic gain, and the inclusion and attainment (or not), of economic, cultural, racial, and gender justice. PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU and director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia. Currently she also co-coordinates the \u201cNetwork of Observatories on Racism in the Americas,\u201d an initiative launched by the Universidad de la Cordillera and the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas. She is the author of works on race, racism, gender, sexism, ethnicity, interculturality and state formation in Bolivia and coeditor of Antropolog\u00eda del Estado: Dominaci\u00f3n y pr\u00e1cticas contestatarias en America Latina . She was an associate researcher for the United Nations-sponsored 2007 report \u201cThe State of the State in Bolivia,\u201d and co-editor of and contributor to Observando el racismo: Racismo y regionalismo en el proceso constituyente boliviano.  The Political Economy of Sports FRSEM-UA 494; class # 14769 Instructor: Neal Beck  syllabus  Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Political economy is a method that can be used to study many areas of human behavior (e.g. Becker on the family, Stigler on regulation, Fogel on history). Sports makes an excellent case study for many of the most important ideas and methods of political economy since it is more easily accessible and has better data than many other potential applications. Each topic is chosen to illustrate an important issue in political economy, and each class meeting features pointers to more traditional political economy applications. In order to cover a wide range of topics, we define political economy quite broadly. In light of NYU's global interests and presence, many applications are drawn from what is known as soccer in the United States. NATHANIEL BECK is Professor of Politics. He specializes in quantitative applications, both in public policy and political science, and issues of research design. He has been at NYU since 2003. At the undergraduate level, he teaches courses in quantitative approaches to public policy and the Senior Honors Seminar. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for Political Methodology, and the founding editor of Political Analysis. Barack Obama, the Man and the President: The Quest for Identity and Purpose FRSEM-UA 495; class # 14940 Instructor: Jeffrey Sammons  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course explores the life and career path of the nation\u2019s first \u201cblack\u201d president through a focus on his two autobiographies. The course also pays close attention to representations by others of Obama, including critics, supporters, and \u201cneutral\u201d commentators through a variety of media from books to film to television and radio to the blogosphere. As important as Obama is for his unprecedented political achievements, his multiracial, multicultural, multinational, and multi-religious background and experience make him an ideal subject for exploring personal and group identity in a time of apparently increasing concern with Otherness. Our goal is to reconcile vastly divergent representations of one person and not uncritically accept what we are led to believe by him or others. Through this process we not only learn about an extraordinary individual and the power he wields and path he shapes, but also about the writing and making of history and who we are\u2014as well as what we think, believe, and practice. JEFFREY T. SAMMONS is a Professor of History at New York University and specializes in African American, urban, military, sports, and film history. Sammons earned a Ph.D. in American History from the University of North Carolina in 1982. In 1983-84 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town. After his return from South Africa, Sammons became involved in the anti-apartheid movement and played an important role in the City of Houston\u2019s divestment campaign. Sammons is currently a National Senator of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Sammons is the author of Beyond the Ring: The Role of Boxing in American Society and has written widely on the subject of sport and race. In 2001 Sammons was awarded a fellowship by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and History and soon after received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for 2002-2003 in support of his soon to be published Never Retreat on the 15th NYNG/369th Regiment and the black soldier\u2019s quest for citizenship in the World War I era. The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496; class # 7284 Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has studied speech practices among Haitians (Queens, N.Y.), lawyers and litigants in lower Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, college students and their use of IM, and Bosavi people (Papua New Guinea). She is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children . She is coeditor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives, Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in preeminent journals of her field, including Current Anthropology and Annual Review of Anthropology . She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people over the past 25 years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication. Professor Schieffelin also received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010 and a Distinguished Teaching Award in 2012. How We See FRSEM-UA 497; class # 7289 Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chair of the Psychology Department. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D. in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. She has published many papers in the most prominent scientific journals in perception, in particular, and in science, in general. Her accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Finding New York City FRSEM-UA 498; class # 7291 Instructor: William Serrin  syllabus  Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. In this seminar, students explore, read, and write about\u2014and develop a deep understanding of\u2014New York City from diverse perspectives and by means of various media. We venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East rivers, restaurants, parks, and the like. We examine New York history and how the city has changed over the decades, writing several pieces on what we see and read and what people tell us. In the end, all should have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has changed over time, what remains from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the future might be. This is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New York City as its laboratory. The seminar turns to reading the splendid books or sections from the splendid books that deal with important aspects of the history and life of New York City, among them The Island at the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties; Forgotten Patriots; The Devil\u2019s Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America; Five Points; Positively 4th Street; and A Freewheelin\u2019 Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties . It also considers how the image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing in part on the book Celluloid Skyline . In addition, it uses parts of the Ken Burns PBS documentary series New York City . WILLIAM SERRIN is Collegiate Professor and Associate Professor of Journalism. Before joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for the New York Times. He has written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek, Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage , and the Nation , as well as the Columbia Journalism Review and the Village Voice .

He also won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award for outstanding labor coverage, and he was a member the Detroit Free Press team of reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 1967 Detroit riots. In addition, he was a recipient of the George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970. He is currently working on two new books: one a memoir of growing up in his hometown, an industrial town (Saginaw, Michigan), the other an examination of how, as industries emerge and grow in America, communities grow up and expand around them, then when the industries move or collapse, the communities that have served its citizens and country so well are often left to collapse and die.  Utopia and Apocalypse FRSEM-UA 499; class # 7294 Instructor: Eliot Borenstein  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) The utopian impulse is the drive to create the perfect world; the apocalypse is the global cataclysm that is often considered utopia\u2019s prerequisite. In this seminar, we examine the development of the utopian tradition, as both literary genre and philosophical thought experiment. Among the questions to be considered: What is the relationship between utopia and the novel? How do we get from \u201chere\u201d (the imperfect world) to \u201cthere\u201d (the perfect one), and how is this journey enacted in fiction? Why are the family, gender, and sexuality so central to the utopian tradition? What is the utopian conception of pleasure? Utopia is often seen as the?culmination of historical progress, the goal toward which humanity has been striving. Later utopian (and anti-utopian) fictions often place their \u201cperfect\u201d societies in a post-apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and temporal dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint of history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials consist of fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including the works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels, More, Moore and Gibbons, and Plato. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as Chair of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies and as Director of the Morse Academic Plan. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of Virginia.

In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture , which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in 2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500; class # 8327  syllabus  Instructor: Kathleen Gerson Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of caring for others. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New economic opportunities and pressures have sent women into the workplace. The rise of the \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family patterns. Taken together, these intertwined shifts represent a social transformation that is reshaping both the daily lives and life pathways of women and men. To explore the causes, consequences, and significance of these twin revolutions in work and care, the class addresses several questions. What does an overview of work, family, and gender changes tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these dilemmas? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? For the first half of the semester, students read, analyze, and discuss cutting-edge research; during the second half, students conduct their own research projects. KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in post-industrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany. In addition to serving as President of the Eastern Sociological Society and Chair of the Family Section of the American Sociological Association, she has contributed to many research and policy initiatives on work, family, and gender issues, including service as a founding board member of the Work-Family Researchers Network and as a board member of the Council on Contemporary Families. Her professional awards include the Jessie Bernard Award, given by the American Sociological Association in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society; the William Goode Distinguished Book Award, given by the Family Section of the ASA for The Unfinished Revolution; the Rosabeth Kanter Award for Excellence in Work-Family Research; the Distinguished Feminist Lectureship on Women and Social Change, awarded by Sociologists for Women in Society; the Kingsley Birge Endowed Lecture, at Colby College; and the Charles Phelps Taft Endowed Lecture, at the University of Cincinnati. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood.  Shamanism FRSEM-UA 501; class # 15017 Instructor: Bruce Grant  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. From New Age sweat lodges to Soviet Siberia, shamanic spirit mediums have been construed as everything from healers to magistrates to visionaries to political subversives. This course explores anthropological literature on shamanism in Asia and the Americas in order to ask how we constitute and appropriate the exotic in a variety of broadly construed religious settings. By focusing on the core figure of the shaman, we also attempt to track a twentieth-century history of anthropological reasoning. BRUCE GRANT is Professor of Anthropology and winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. A specialist on cultural politics in the formerly communist world, he is the author of two award-winning books, In the Soviet House of Culture: A Century of Perestroikas and The Captive and the Gift: Cultural Histories of Sovereignty in Russia and the Caucasus.  Frontiers of Biology FRSEM-UA 502; class # 15019 Instructor: Edo Kussell  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Prerequisites: Both AP Biology 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential) and at least one additional AP science (or mathematics) score of 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential). Biology has become an incredibly interdisciplinary science. Major breakthroughs often result from key collaborations between scientists inventing new technologies and biologists studying the fundamental questions of life. This seminar focuses on the latest discoveries in biology and the technological innovations that enable them. Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, the seminar leapfrogs classical textbook biology and mere memorization to present science at the forefront of biological research. Topics that may be covered (always in great depth and detail) include metagenomics, synthetic biology, quantitative immunology, microbial ecology, and biology at the single-molecule level. Emphasis is placed on understanding how the scientific research process works in today\u2019s world. This demanding course is geared towards highly motivated individuals, with a superlative high school background in science and a deep passion for scientific inquiry, but is open to students in all majors. Each student is required to lead at least one class session, to interview a scientist (no family members or scientists working at any NYU-affiliated school), and to produce a long research paper with accompanying formal oral presentation. EDO KUSSELL is an Associate Professor of Biology and Physics, and a faculty in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU. He is a recipient of both the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface and the McDonnell Foundation Research Award in Studying Complex Systems. Prof. Kussell's research is on evolutionary dynamics in general, with a focus on microorganisms. His lab studies bacterial adaptations to fluctuating environments, combining mathematical modeling, physics, and experimental biology. In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503; class # 7286 Instructor: Marcelle Clements Thursday, 2:15\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and deeply pleasurable reads. The richest of the themes it explores is desire\u2014its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of art. Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. Although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist (and the novelist\u2019s novelist), his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time \u2019s prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and of two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.  Spring 2014 American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan FRSEM-UA 504; class # 8309 Instructor: Marilyn B. Young  syllabus  Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The course will consider the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two wars of the 21st century. It will begin with the history, memory, and subsequent political uses of the Vietnam War. We will then move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by the way the administration of President George H.W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and goals, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We shall examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as well as the abundance of documentary and fiction film in which they have all been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B. YOUNG, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945\u20131990, The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895\u20131901, Transforming Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th Century , with William Rosenberg, and Human Rights and Revolutions , with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey Wasserstrom. She has also edited several collections of essays on the recent wars in Iraq and, most recently, Bombing Civilians: A 20th-Century History . She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of learned Societies Fellowship. Twice she has won the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, and she is currently co-director of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War. She is currently president-elect of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations.  Helen of Troy and Her Ghosts FRSEM-UA 505, class # 15880 Instructor: Liana Theodoratou  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon In Homer\u2019s Iliad , Helen, reflecting on her destiny, proclaims that her function is not primarily to be a woman, but to be first and foremost a story. \u201cOn us the gods have set an evil destiny,\u201d she explains, \u201cthat we should be a singer\u2019s theme / for generations to come\u201d (Il.6.357-58). Taking its point of departure from the Helen of ancient Greece\u2014the daughter of Zeus and Leda\u2014this course traces the various Helens whose stories have been told throughout the history of Western literature\u2014from the Helen of Homer to that of Sappho, Stesichorus, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides, Pierre Ronsard, Christopher Marlowe, Gerard de Nerval, Jean Giraudoux, W.B.Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Yannis Ritsos, and beyond. Within this literary trajectory, Helen becomes a means of tracing the story of literature itself. She is composed of all the ideas and desires that have been projected onto her body. In the wording of the modernist poet, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), \u201cHelen is the Greek drama.\u201d In each instance, Helen\u2019s identity is shattered across an entire history of representations of her relation to literature and poetry and, in the process, she even becomes another name for literature and poetry. Tracing this history permits us to think about the survival of the past in the present, about the role and place of representation in the establishment of identity in general, and about the way in which the present is haunted by the phantoms of the past. LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. She has written widely on ancient and modern Greek poetry and has translated several works by, among others, Foucault, Althusser, and Derrida into Modern Greek. She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece.  Game Theory and the Humanities FRSEM-UA 506; class # 15980 Instructor: Steven Brams  syllabus Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. Among the applications to be discussed are Abraham's decision to offer his son, Isaac, for sacrifice in the Bible; choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of Macbeth to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare's play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (the Civil War, the Great Depression, Watergate) and international crises (the Cuban missile crisis, the Iran hostage crisis); and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22) . STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature. He holds two patents for fair-division algorithms and is chairman of the advisory board of Fair Outcomes, Inc. He is a former president of the Peace Science Society and of the Public Choice Society. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Guggenheim Fellow, and was a Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.   Spring 2014 What is Memory FRSEM-UA 507; class # 14597 Instructor: Suzanne England  syllabus  Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as How is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. SUZANNE ENGLAND is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. What is Memory FRSEM-UA 507; class # 16468 Instructor: Martha Rust  syllabus  Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia.

Spring 2014 Great Inventions in World History: Breakthrough Technologies that Changed the Course of Civilizations FRSEM-UA 508; class # 14598 Instructor: Richard W. Hull  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) This seminar is an exploration in human ingenuity, from antiquity to the twentieth century. It focuses on eighteen key inventions that profoundly affected the course of civilizations and that changed the way people lived and thought about themselves and the world around them. It examines the origins of the inventions, the individuals or groups that developed or conceived them, their initial impact on the societies of their inventors, their diffusion to other cultures and ultimately their impact on a global scale. It considers the transfer of technical knowledge from one country or culture to another and how it is modified and adapted by the recipients and may trigger a different but improved or related invention. In the process, we examine the interaction of technologies and society. Some inventions constitute \u201cbricolage,\u201d taking available resources and cobbling them together to create entirely new uses. Each invention we study generated a veritable revolution in the way humans interacted with each other, organized their lives, and mobilized their human and natural resources. In some cases we consider how specific inventions improved the human condition and/or degraded it. We explore the very idea of \u201cinvention\u201dand weigh situations or intellectual challenges that gave rise to inventive impulses. We pose numerous questions: Why do some societies enthusiastically embrace a given invention or innovation while others reject it as see it as a threat? How do some groups attempt to monopolize an invention and endeavor to prevent its spread to other governments or cultures? The scope of the course is expansive, running from such geniuses as al-Khwarizmi and his algorithms in the ninth century C.E. to Steve Jobs and the computer in the twentieth. RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns, Modern Africa , and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence.  Spring 2014 Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace FRSEM-UA 509; class # 14599 Instructor: Anne Lounsbery  syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Our first priority is a careful reading of Tolstoy\u2019s massive novel (if it is in fact a \u201cnovel\u201d: this is one of the questions we address), with the goal of understanding how the text works. We also consider the book\u2019s historical context, the sources that Tolstoy drew on, its place in his oeuvre and thought, its place in the Russian tradition and in \u201cworld\u201d literature, and the various uses that have been made of it since its initial publication. ANNE LOUNSBERY is Associate Professor of Russian Literature and chair of the Department of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies. Her Ph.D. is in Comparative Literature, and she writes chiefly about nineteenth-century Russian, European and American prose. Her first book Thin Culture, High Art was on Russian and American literature; she is currently finishing a book on Russian novels and geographic space, Life Is Elsewhere: Symbolic Geography in the Russian Novel . Tolstoy's War and Peace is Professor Lounsbery's favorite book, and she never gets tired of re-reading it (most recently last summer, in Russian, on her iPhone). She has won the Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence and enjoys working closely with undergraduates. Philosophizing with Shakespeare FRSEM-UA 510; class # 16302 Instructor: Tom Gerety  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. One of the fascinating things about William Shakespeare is that we can never be sure if the exchanges and speeches he gives to his characters show his own convictions or, more likely, his conception of how kings and queens and lovers would think and feel. This seminar examines several of his greatest plays, including King Lear, Hamlet, The Tempest , and The Merchant of Venice . We study these and a few other plays in depth and with special attention to the ideas and arguments in them about life and death, the relations between the sexes, and between the classes. We consider the views his characters articulate about love and hatred, God and morality, virtue and vice. We try to understand what he thought about government and coercion, and about the limits of freedom and the inevitability of oppression and tragedy. We read (and see, on stage and on film) his plays and look to his great sources such as the King James Bible and the Essays of Michel de Montaigne. We learn all that we can about his life in Stratford and London, the world of the stage and court, and the great political and religious controversies of his time in England and Europe. We find that Shakespeare was in many ways not just an artist but a philosopher. His gift for summarizing and personifying ideas make him an elusive but important figure in the history of ideas. He stands on the bridge, as it were, between the Renaissance and the modern world. His ideas\u2013or those to which he gave such powerful voice\u2013propelled England and Europe towards the modern world of science, skepticism and materialism that we now inhabit. TOM GERETY, Collegiate Professor, joined the NYU faculty in 2005, having first come to NYU two years earlier to head the Brennan Center for Justice at the Law School. Before then he served as President of Amherst College from 1994 to 2003 and of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1994. From 1986 to 1989 he was the Dean and Nippert Professor at the College of Law of the University of Cincinnati. As a law professor he taught and wrote on constitutional law and political philosophy, with a special emphasis on First Amendment freedoms, including speech, privacy, and religious freedom. With Judy Woodruff, he wrote and narrated a PBS series, Visions of the Constitution , funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is the author, most recently, of The Freshman Who Hated Socrates . The Remarkable Normans: Europe from 911 to 1204 FRSEM-UA 511; class # 16303 Instructor: Jill N. Claster  syllabus  Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Few people in all of European history can boast a history of achievements comparable to that of the Normans in the nearly three hundred years following the founding of the duchy of Normandy in 911. From the tenth century until 1204, there was not a single important event in which the Normans were not involved or did not play a pivotal role. This course follows the Norman expansion: the conquest of England, of Sicily and southern Italy, of large parts of France, and cities in the eastern Mediterranean. The Normans were initiators and leaders of the crusades to the Holy Land and they fought as well in Spain against the Muslims. Although these descendants of Viking invaders never lost their taste for adventure and their warlike spirit, the Normans were also great organizers and the government in Normandy, as well as in the places they conquered, were the most advanced and efficient in all of Europe. They left a rich legacy in every field imaginable: art and architecture, religious institutions, political organization, and educational institutions. The Normans stood at the forefront of a long period of material, cultural and spiritual progress in Europe, and this seminar studies the many gifts the Normans gave to European civilization. JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 .

Spring 2014 Nuclear Energy FRSEM-UA 512; class # 14600 Instructor: Antoine Cerfon  syllabus  Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Nuclear power currently provides 13% of the world's electricity and is expected to play an important role in the diversified energy mix that countries are developing to meet the world's growing energy needs. As a carbon-free, continuous energy source, it is an attractive solution for base-load electricity production, and a desirable complement to intermittent sources such as solar and wind. However, it also faces serious technological, economical and societal challenges that question its development. In this seminar, we follow a multidisciplinary approach to explore the different dimensions of the debate about nuclear power. We look at the basic nuclear physics in the core of power plants, the different power plant concepts and their engineering solutions, the nuclear fuel cycle, the issues of waste, safety and proliferation, nuclear power economics, and the place of nuclear energy in the global energy landscape. ANTOINE CERFON is Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He obtained his Ph.D. in the Nuclear Science and Engineering department at MIT, and stayed there for two more years as a post-doctoral researcher before joining NYU in 2012. His main area of study is in plasma physics for particle accelerators and nuclear fusion applications. Introduction to Aesthetics FRSEM-UA 513; class # 16306 Instructor: Eduardo Subirats  syllabus  Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar focuses on four major Western theorists of aesthetics: Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. It will reconstruct central categories such as form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will analyze four programmatic works of art: modern \u201ccubism\u201d (Picasso), a Greek tragedy (Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound ), a German trickster ( Till Eugenspiegel ), and a French revolutionary painter (Courbet\u2019s Atelier ). Its ultimate goal is a critique of contemporary artistic decadence and anti-aesthetics. EUDARDO SUBIRATS is Professor of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include Spanish intellectual history; the Counter-Reformation and the colonization of Spanish America; the Enlightenment; avant-garde theory, artistic movements in Spain and Latin America; and the modern Latin American and Spanish essay. Among his many publications are Linterna M\u00e1gica; El continente vac\u00edo; Da vanguarda ao p\u00f3s-moderno; Memoria y exilio; Viaje al fin del Para\u00edso. Un ensayo sobre Am\u00e9rica latina; and Filosof\u00eda y tiempo final.  Spring 2014 Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher FRSEM-UA 514; class # 14601 Instructor: Vincent Renzi  syllabus  Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m. Required Cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Oeconomicus, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Associate Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics. He serves as a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Perception of Art FRSEM-UA 515; class # 16494 Instructor: Denis Pelli  syllabus  Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. We apply the scientific methods of perception research, psychophysics, to explore and understand how people experience art. A few artists (e.g. a painter and a photographer) visit class or invite us to their studios to talk about the creative process and answer questions. We visit current shows in museums and galleries that address questions that arise in class--for example, do artists distinguish painting for themselves from painting for the public? Why is a figure like Philip Guston so popular among fellow painters, but unpopular with the public and critics? Pairs of students collaborate on an experiment answering some question or topic bearing on the perception of art, which is written up as a term project. DENIS PELLI, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU, has contributed new measurement techniques, major empirical findings, and useful theoretical accounts of object recognition. As a psychophysicist, he invented many widely used and highly cited methods for testing how vision works. His 150 papers on object recognition have been cited nearly 10,000 times. His scientific expertise is complemented by an informal knowledge of art. He grew up in a family of architects and a landscape designer (Pelli and Balmori) that spends most of its time together talking about how things look and why. He enjoys sketching and also helped a choreographer produce a ballet designed to be seen in peripheral vision. For more on his work, visit http://denispelli.com.  Spring 2014 Architecture in the City FRSEM-UA 516; class # 14602 Instructor: Marvin Trachtenberg  syllabus  Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) This seminar introduces students to key themes in western architecture from prehistory to postmodernity. It bridges immediacy and history using the buildings and spaces of our city as a primary object of study. Key texts are discussed, but emphasis is placed on the experience and understanding of buildings and their sites through media (photography and film) and direct encounters with the built environment of New York City. Themes such as the ecological basis of architecture, the question of nature, culture, and landscape, and architecture as idea, process, artifact and space are explored along with other topics relevant to the understanding of architecture. As an undergraduate, MARVIN TRACHTENBERG studied English literature at Yale with Harold Bloom. At the the Institute of Fine Arts, he turned to premodern architecture under Wolfgang Lotz, Richard Pommer, and especially Richard Krautheimer, who supervised his monograph on the Florentine Campanile (awarded the Society of Architectural Historians\u2019 Hitchcock Prize). After a return to modernity with his Statue of Liberty and a decade producing a survey of architectural history ( Architecture from Prehistory to Postmodernity ), Trachtenberg again focused on pre-modern Italy with his radically revisionist (and award-winning) study of trecento urbanism, Dominion of the Eye . Issues raised by structures with long building histories and multiple architects led him to formulate the ideas discussed in Building-in-Time from Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (George Sarton Prize in History of Science, Ghent University). He is currently completing a book, on new discursive terms, for Yale University Press on Brunelleschi and the Pazzi Chapel. Since 1967 he has taught at the Institute of Fine Arts, where he is Edith Kitzmiller Professor of Art History. Spain in 1492: From the 'Moor's Last Sigh' to the Conquest of the New World FRSEM-UA 517; class # 16558 Instructor: Sarah Pearce  syllabus  Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The year 1492 in Spain is the very definition of a watershed. Four major, related events took place that completely altered the social, political, religious, intellectual, literary and linguistic landscape: the city of Granada, the last Muslim principality in Spain, fell to the Catholic crown of Castile and Leon; the order was signed and carried out expelling or forcing the conversion of Spain\u2019s Jews; with Spanish backing, Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the New World; and the first grammar of a vernacular Romance language, Castilian, appeared in print and was dedicated to the queen in honor of her imperial ambitions. This course examines literary and historical writing about these events. Through careful reading of primary sources and attention to modern historians\u2019 rhetoric in writing about 1492, students explore how these events were implicated in the formation of national and religious identities in late medieval and early modern Spain. Reading in a wide variety of genres leads to diverse writing assignments in a variety of genres to help prepare students for further coursework in the liberal arts. S.J. PEARCE is an assistant professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. She returns to NYU after having held the Apfelbaum Fellowship in Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania during 2012-13, where she completed a book-length manuscript entitled \"No Achievement But Through Arabic\" in which she explores the attitudes of medieval Spanish Jews towards reading and writing in the Arabic language. She tweets about the Middle Ages @homophonous. Urban Objects: How Things in the City Make Life Possible or (Almost) Impossible FRSEM-UA 518; class # 16559 Instructor: Harvey Molotch  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon We concentrate on very ordinary things: trash bins, stop signs, lamp posts, turnstiles, fences, and whatever else we encounter in the course of public city life. We trace out where these things come from, what caused them to take their specific forms and the way they cost or benefit social groups in particular ways (e.g. women versus men, kids versus adults, rich versus poor). Our interest is in public space, public life, and private benefits as revealed by the things we see, touch, jump over, ignore, vandalize and use. All along, we read about urban space, the use and abuse of the city, and the role of physical objects in our lives. We do first-hand studies of people\u2019s encounters with these artifacts in real time. Each student chooses one or more objects for preliminary write-up(s) and then hones in on one for a final term paper. HARVEY MOLOTCH, Professor of Sociology and Metropolitan Studies, has authored many articles and books, the most recent being Against Security: How We Go Wrong at Airports, Subways, and Other Sites of Ambiguous Danger . A prior book, Where Stuff Comes From, analyzes the world of product development and design. His awards include: Distinguished Contribution to the Discipline of Sociology, Award for Lifetime Achievement in Urban and Community Studies, and Lifetime Achievement in Sociology of the Environment and Technology.  Encountering Martin Luther King, Jr. FRSEM-UA 519; class # 16575 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus  Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.)  Few historical figures are more revered or transcendent than Martin Luther King Jr. But as David Levering Lewis wrote thirty-five years ago, America\u2019s canonization of him has draped him in such a cloak of mythology that \u201cin a sense we have sought to remember him by forgetting him.\u201d This course seeks to vividly remember the human being at the center of the most significant popular movement in U.S. history, one that took up the unfinished legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction eighty years after the nation turned its back on social and racial justice. Students explore King\u2019s thought, oratory, character, and public actions in a way that will make him unforgettable to them. We consider his tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth from a southern Baptist minister to a leading civil rights activist to a visionary leader of global human rights and peace. We ask if he was a radical or a moderate and why he felt history had \u201chunted him down,\u201d as he once claimed to fellow activist Rosa Parks. In what ways can new information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing periods of American history? Using film and little-known radio interviews as part of the class research, as well a challenging immersion in some of the most significant King literature, the course, coming in the fiftieth anniversary year of the March on Washington, makes King and his times newly relevant to our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and violence-haunted world. PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities, and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five books, including Looking for Lincoln, The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America\u2019s Greatest Showman . He was also writer and co-producer of more than a dozen documentary films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and others, including the ten-part PBS series The American President , and the sixteen part Freedom: A History of US. Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in Annandale, New York. Writing the Self and New York FRSEM-UA 520; class # 18468 Instructor: David J. Dent Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. In this course students begin the semester by dusting off their college admissions essays. The first assignment requires students to explore the ideas of the personal essay beyond the individual and develop the essay into a piece of narrative nonfiction. Beyond that first assignment, students spend the semester exploring the city of New York through a series of writing assignments on urban life. Students also read several classic pieces of literary journalism, personal essays and fiction about life in New York City. DAVID J. DENT is Associate Professor at New York University where he holds a joint appointment at the Arthur Carter Journalism Institute and in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. He created the course \u201cDeconstructing Obama\u201d and teaches courses in journalism and non-fiction writing.

The organization uses the tools of journalism to help middle and high school students become better writers, a method detailed in The Best Essay of Your Life.   Spring 2014 Visuality and Literature FRSEM-UA 521; class # 14603 Instructor: Jennifer Cayer  syllabus  Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) In this course we examine twentieth-century and contemporary essays, novels, short stories and plays that are preoccupied with the visual, perform visually, or integrate images within narrative. Some of these works respond directly to pieces of visual art or analyze forms of seeing; others include images such as photographs or drawings. This is a writing-intensive course. While actively discussing the course materials, students consistently and frequently engage them through critical and creative, formal and informal writing. One of our goals is to deepen our own practices of seeing and using visual evidence as a method toward writing personal, exploratory, and persuasive essays. Topics may include: memoir, documentary works, photography, film adaptations, comics, graphic novels, artists books and surrealism.

Spring 2014 Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522; class # 14604 Instructor: Tara K. Parmiter Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Essayist Loren Eiseley asserts that \u201ceven in New York City there are patches of wilderness,\u201d encouraging his readers to rethink the way they define and limit their use of this loaded word. In this course we examine both the idea and the manifestation of these wildernesses, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Readings include selections by Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, Terry Tempest Williams, bell hooks, Wendell Berry, and William Cronon, among others. Students compose both critical analyses of the texts and their own nature writing based on their exploration of and research into their own \u201cpatch\u201d of New York wilderness. TARA K. PARMITER is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program and a Mentor in the Undergraduate Writing Tutors Program. Her research interests include literature and the environment, turn-of-the-twentieth century women\u2019s literature, children\u2019s literature, travel narratives, and popular culture.

Spring 2014 Reading Toni Morrison FRSEM-UA 523; class # 14612 Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature, Toni Morrison was the eighth woman and first African American ever to receive that award. In its citation, the Swedish Academy praised her as someone \u201cwho, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality.\u201d This course seeks to identify and to examine that \u201cessential aspect of American reality.\u201d We read the writings of Morrison, exploring the ways in which she represents history, identity, nation, race, gender, sexuality, and community in novels and essays that both challenge and complicate our understanding of these themes. Our aim is to understand the formal aspects of her writing\u2014how her novels \u201cwork\u201d as literature\u2014as well as the cultural and historical interventions it makes. We also take up questions about Morrison\u2019s reputation among contemporary readers of her fiction, and the various outlets, including Oprah\u2019s Book Club, where it has been championed. Students taking this class should expect to read great books that inspire hard conversations about race, gender, sexuality, and American social and cultural history; through our reading, several short papers, and a research project of their own design students hone their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers. ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction.

Spring 2014 Atlantic Migrations since 1600 FRSEM-UA 524; class # 14629 Instructor: Joe Lee  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The movement of people, voluntarily and involuntarily, from Europe and Africa across the Atlantic to North and South America since about 1600 is one of the epochal events in world history. It has had a major impact\u2014and in many cases has left an indelible mark\u2014on the histories of both the sending and receiving of societies and cultures, whether the multitudes involved moved as free men and women, as indentured servants, or as slaves. This course seeks to understand the causes and consequences, economic, social, political and cultural, of these massive movements of human beings. JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU.

Fern\u00e1ndez Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Prerequisite: reading knowledge of Spanish and/or a score of 4 or 5 on any AP Spanish exam (or international equivalent). According to demographers, in the near future one out of every three New Yorkers will be of Hispanic origin. Far from being a recent phenomenon, the presence of Spanish-speaking people in the city can be traced back almost to the origins of the city in the seventeenth century. In the first part of this course we study the history of links between New York City and the Spanish-speaking world, from the arrival of 23 Sephardic Jews to the town of New Amsterdam in 1654, to the arrival of Spanish refugees fleeing from Fascism in the early 1940s. During the second part of the course, participants contribute to the creation of a website that will map and document traces of Spain and Spanish-speakers in the city of New York. We make a number of field trips during the semester, and one of the assignments is to design and script a walking tour. Readings include texts by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (Cuba), Bernardo Vega (Puerto Rico) and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (Spain). JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.

He is the author of Apology to Apostrophe: Autobiography and the Rhetoric of Self-Representation in Spain.  Spring 2014 Biography's Many Lives FRSEM-UA 526; class # 14605 Instructor: Victoria Olsen  syllabus  Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The genre of biography has traced lives of \"famous men\" since Plutarch and Boswell's Johnson, but its conventional forms and techniques have come into question over the last century. This course examines how biography provides a window into different periods, cultures, and disciplines and how it has had to stretch to incorporate new voices, methodologies, and techniques. From Virginia Woolf's Orlando to Rebecca Skloot's Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, biography has pushed the boundaries of literary form and scientific knowledge. We read a broad range of subjects and styles\u2014exploring issues of research, writing, and reading\u2014to become biographers of the genre itself. VICTORIA OLSEN, Ph.D. is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where she teaches Writing the Essay to freshmen at Tisch and Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines to undergraduates in CAS. She has been a writing consultant and mentor to writing tutors in psychology, biology, philosophy, and history courses. She is the author of the biography From Life: Julia Margaret Cameron and Victorian Photography.  Spring 2014 Cultures of Science and Belief FRSEM-UA 527; class # 14992 Instructor: Noelle J. Mol\u00e9  syllabus   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon We regularly take for granted that scientific knowledge is objective, a universal truth unchanged by history and culture. The laws of physics are just as true in Indonesia as they are in Mexico or the United States. Yet we also know that scientific knowledge is constantly in flux. What we \u201cknew\u201d to be true yesterday (e.g., the world is flat) is not true today, and new discoveries revolutionize what we knew (e.g., germ theory, epigenetics). This seminar positions science along a spectrum of worldviews\u2014explanatory models that provide causal reasons and underlying logics for events and actions\u2014a spectrum that includes magic, occultism, witchcraft, science, spirituality, and religion. A single hurricane might be explained, within particular historical and cultural contexts, as being sent by a witch\u2019s curse, a moving cold front, or an angry god. How we position ourselves between these ways of knowing is not, of course, mutually exclusive and the threshold between the categories is actually more blurred than we might initially expect. Interrogating the similarities and differences between \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cbelief,\u201d this course questions our deeply held assumptions regarding the neutrality of science and the so-called backwardness of folk belief. How do socio-cultural contexts and economic systems shape the production of scientific knowledge? Why do certain theories achieve recognition as rational and correct? We explore the social, economic, and political implications of these hierarchies of knowledge, and examine how they shape how we experience our own bodies, our own feelings, and even our own minds. NOELLE J. MOL\u00c9 is a cultural anthropologist and author of Labor Disorders in Neoliberal Italy: Mobbing, Well-being and the Workplace . She is currently investigating the rise of scientific skepticism and supernatural beliefs in Italy as twin responses to a millennial crisis in knowledge production. She is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program.  Spring 2014 The Art of Note Taking FRSEM-UA 528; class # 14606 Instructor: Louis Bury Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Taking notes is first and foremost a utilitarian act, a way of recording information for the purposes of future use and improved retention. But notes also possess, importantly, an aesthetic dimension: splayed across the page in poetic fragments, they present a veritable graph of a mind in motion. In this course we consider note taking as both an aesthetic and utilitarian act. Our course readings focus on exemplary notes, diaries, and journals by prominent 20th century writers and artists, as well as older species of textual response such as Talmudic commentary and marginalia on Medieval manuscripts. We may also consider contemporary forms of digital writing that verge on note taking, such as blog posts, tweets, and Internet commentary. We use these texts as both source material and inspiration for our own extensive note taking. The goal is not simply to help you to become a better note taker but to help you understand how note taking is itself a form of writing and of thinking and not merely preparation for the \"real\" writing that you submit to your professors. Course requirements include: weekly reading and note taking; a midterm presentation; one short essay; and a final research project, developed out of your weekly notes. LOUIS BURY is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. His first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (Dalkey Archive Press, forthcoming) applies rules and restrictions in order to write poetic, autobiographical literary criticism. He is currently taking notes for a book on literary note taking.  Spring 2014 Sensual Shifts: From Looking to Listening in Modernist Literature FRSEM-UA 529; class # 14607 Instructor: Angela Frattarola  syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). From Greek philosophy to the Enlightenment, vision was the privileged sense. Traditionally associated with knowledge and rationality, vision encourages a subject to keep a distanced, analytical perspective of an object. But does this always have to be the case? Can the other senses allow new ways of conceiving of and experiencing the relationship between the self and the world? This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world. We accomplish this by closely reading modernist novels that suggest a growing skepticism toward vision and heightened attention to sound and listening. In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time. Readings for the course consist of essays from sound studies as well as novels by Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Jean Rhys, and James Joyce.

Spring 2014 Rediscovering Bacchic Revelry FRSEM-UA 530; class # 15031 Instructor: Megan Shea  syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). When we think about the staging of ancient Greek theater, we often envision a static stage where a masked man recites a lengthy monologue in an outdoor theater. But such a vision hardly describes the dynamic celebration of music, sexuality, and poetry that infused the City Dionysia and the Lenaia\u2014the Athenian festivals centered on tragedy and comedy in the sixth through the fourth Centuries B.C.E. In this seminar, we reimagine the performance of Greek theater by witnessing current productions of Greek plays, engaging with New York City\u2019s various collections of Greek art objects, studying contemporary festivals and celebrations, poring through critical interpretations of Greek history, and returning to textual evidence (the plays!). Beyond reconstructing our own understandings of ancient performance, we use the discord between our original scenarios of Greek performance and our revisions to evaluate how we conceive of Western civilization\u2019s past. Weekly response papers, a performance/design project, and a final research paper help awaken our sense of ancient performative acts. MEGAN SHEA is a language lecturer in NYU\u2019s Expository Writing Program. She received her Ph.D. in Theater Arts from Cornell University, where she studied women\u2019s performance in ancient Greece and the contemporary West. While teaching at Cornell, she received the Gertrude Spencer Student Portfolio Award, and she has received several Excellence in Teaching awards while at NYU. Dr. Shea has published articles in The Journal for Dramatic Theory and Criticism and TheatreForum . She recently premiered her translation of Euripides\u2019 Cyclops at Dixon Place.  Spring 2014 Left Brain, Right Brain, Whole Brain: Acts of Knowledge, Discovery, and Creation FRSEM-UA 531; class # 14608 Instructor: David Ellis  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Artists and scientists are often split into separate camps in the university and in our collective imagination; this split can even divide our individual minds. \u201cLeft brains\u201d\u2014the analytical, logical, objective among us\u2014become engineers, biologists, and bankers while \u201cright brains\u201d\u2014intuitive, thoughtful, subjective\u2014are the painters, philosophers, and social workers of the world. In practice, in the science lab or in the artist\u2019s studio, these distinctions may be more porous than we popularly believe. This seminar explores the interplay between reasoning, knowledge, belief, discovery, and creativity\u2014acts of mind common to all fields in the academy. Whether presented to us in the \u201creal world,\u201d the arts, or philosophy, we will wrestle with conundrums which resist easy solution. We explore many branches\u2014logic, physics, neurology, psychology, literature, film, visual and performance art\u2014hunting for approaches to understanding which we then put into practice. We work towards the goal of \u201cunderstanding our understanding,\u201d as the artist Matthew Goulish phrases it, in order to exploit the twinned powers of rationality and creativity. Trips to MoMath (Museum of Mathematics), MoMA, and other outings are planned. In his \u201cright-brained\u201d work as a poet, fiction writer, and visual artist, DAVID ELLIS explores science topics with a humanities approach, such as the nature of time, memory, sensory perception, social dynamics, and spatial relationships. His work in NYU\u2019s Writing in the Disciplines program has taken him into a range of \u201cleft-brained\u201d classrooms, from astrophysics to psychology, and at the City University of New York he teamed up with a geologist and a classicist who specializes in Roman artifacts to teach a series a classes with shared research and creative practices, which was the basis of their work \u201cVolcanoes, Vases, and Creation Stories.\u201d He teaches in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. Natural and Artificial Intelligence FRSEM-UA 532; class # 18663 Instructor: Gary Marcus  syllabus Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Prerequisite: Programming experience recommended. Who's smarter\u2014Siri or Einstein? Is a \"singularity\" imminent? Through readings in psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science, we compare brains and computers, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and the prospects for human-level artificial intelligence. Topics include language, vision, game-playing, robotics, common-sense reasoning, and computational creativity. GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .  New Worlds, Old Worlds: Travelers and Pilgrims in Renaissance Europe and the Americas FRSEM-UA 533; class # 19001 Instructor: Jane Tylus Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Renaissance men\u2014and women\u2014found themselves at the intersection of colliding ideas about the worlds they lived in. They both looked back to antiquity and the Bible, and ahead to new and unpredictable changes regarding religion, geography, and science. The literature of travel in the period bears witness to the instability and excitement of the centuries that bear the hallmarks of the \u201cearly modern.\u201d Travelers included pilgrims and knights going off on crusade and missionaries going off to convert, as well as explorers, merchants, and inevitably, exiles. If pilgrimage was about the return to a \u201ccenter\u201d\u2014Jerusalem most prominently, but also Rome\u2014 exploration meant voyaging to an unknown periphery, and exilic wandering meant heading toward a new and uncertain home. We explore the period from roughly 1300 to 1700 through travel literature ranging from pilgrimage accounts to Columbus\u2019s letters to an epic about the first Crusade. We also look at such alternate accounts as the Aztec version of the conquista and Arabic responses to the Crusades. The course includes visiting at least one museum in New York and studying cartographic images at the New York Public Library. Students produce collaborative in-class presentations as well as a final paper exploring their own personal journey through the new and old worlds they encountered during their first semester of college. JANE TYLUS is Professor of Italian Studies and Comparative Literature at NYU, as well as faculty director of the Humanities Initiative. Prior to coming to NYU in 2003 she taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While her research focus of late has been on Italian women writers\u2014she is the award-winning author of Reclaiming Catherine of Siena: Literature, Literacy, and the Signs of Others and translator of the poetry of Gaspara Stampa and Lucrezia Tornabuoni\u2014she is really a comparatist at heart, and her favorite courses are on the \"great books\" of world literature. Her current projects are books on the beautiful Tuscan hill-town of Siena and on medieval and early modern pilgrimage. On Being Human FRSEM-UA 534; class # 19002 Instructors: G. Gabrielle Starr &amp; Jane Tylus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The sciences are united by their method of inquiry into the natural world and the social sciences in their study of human behavior, but the humanities seem different \u2014rich, heterogeneous, or perhaps even fragmented. Different or not, the humanities offer unique and powerful models that help us think about and understand the world we inhabit. We study ideas that have been foci of humanist inquiry from the ancient world to the present, and engage these ideas to show what humanist thought has to contribute to some big questions about human life. These ideas include simile (with a focus on pain, trauma, and the medical humanities), evidence (digital humanities, archives, and jurisprudence), dialogue (music, drama), empathy (history and philosophy), and ekphrasis (art history and literature). The course features site visits to the places where humanist engagement matters (hospitals, archives, museums, and even law courts) and encourages students to reflect upon their possible career paths as well as the connections among different disciplines, eras, and methodologies. Finally, the course considers why New York City and NYU are crucial for the humanities in the twenty-first century, in light of the City\u2019s diverse nature and NYU\u2019s identity as a global university. G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience . In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts. JANE TYLUS is Professor of Italian Studies and Comparative Literature at NYU, as well as faculty director of the Humanities Initiative. Prior to coming to NYU in 2003 she taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While her research focus of late has been on Italian women writers\u2014she is the award-winning author of Reclaiming Catherine of Siena: Literature, Literacy and the Signs of Others and translator of the poetry of Gaspara Stampa and Lucrezia Tornabuoni\u2014she is really a comparatist at heart, and her favorite courses are on the \"great books\" of world literature. Her current projects are books on the beautiful Tuscan hill-town of Siena and on medieval and early modern pilgrimage.  Spring 2014 Cataclysm and Voice in the Twentieth-Century Novel FRSEM-UA 535; class # 15225 Instructor: Leeore Schnairsohn Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). The course examines how novelists of the twentieth century responded to the cataclysms, both conceptual and historical, of that slippery and multifarious period of time. At the century's opening, people were trying to get a grip on things like airplanes and telephones and relativity theory and the Russian Revolution. Concurrently, artists were changing the way they made art, and kept changing it as the century continued to provoke them. We read some astounding novelists and consider their voices in conversation with the cataclysms of their times. We also write in response to the ways our world is changing at the turn of this new century, and attempt experiments with fiction and essay to construct true slivers of experience that speak from our own historical position. The class period is divided between discussion of the week's reading and a creative writing workshop. In addition to a final critical essay, students are expected to contribute one piece of creative prose (likely some form of fiction) to the workshop, and complete weekly writing assignments (some creative, some in response to the reading, some both). LEEORE SCHNAIRSOHN holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Princeton and is currently a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. His translations of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam have appeared in Portals and Inventory ; he has also published review articles in the Slavic and East European Journal and Canadian-American Slavic Studies . He is at work on a vampire novel and a non-vampire novel.  Spring 2014 Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536; class # 15924 Instructor: Dylon Robbins Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Brazil is often invoked in conversations about race and culture. Whether as an example of presumably more egalitarian race relations, or as a regional culture embodying an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements, Brazil is a model for understanding heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. We explore some of the unique contradictions shaping Brazilian reality as related to notions of race and culture by tracing the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, examining such key examples and events as slavery and the plantation economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. How do race and culture coincide and diverge in Brazil? And what may we gather about these convergences and divergences from textual, musical, and cinematic examples? DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular interest in the cultural and theoretical production of these regions, in addition to that of the African Diasporas in general, with particular concern for intellectual and cultural histories, media, cinema, and popular music. His work is supported by archival research in Brazil as a Fulbright-Hays fellow at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros, and in Cuba at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. He is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.  Spring 2014 Lincoln in Time: Private and Public Transformations   FRSEM-UA 537; class # 16575 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt    syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00-3:00 p.m.   This seminar engages students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln's  transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American  presidencies. We closely explore the personal Lincoln, always in the  context of his times and their challenges, and see how a series of  wrenching personal crises sorely tested but also helped forge Lincoln's  character. Through the study of key texts, through intensive group  discussion, and through written and spoken communication, the seminar  presents students with a series of questions: Is there a moral realm with  which human actors engage for good or ill? How do private decisions and  inner resolves impact unfolding events? And how do figures like Lincoln  manage to grow past limitations of viewpoint and errors of judgment to  embrace universal human values and commitments?  We examine Lincoln's role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric,  and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of  slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How  was he influenced by other figures around him-southerners, abolitionists,  former slaves, politicians? And how did he learn to use words so  effectively to help produce social transformation? Concurrent with a close  study of Lincoln's written and spoken words, and of the political, social,  and interpersonal context of his times, students also wrestle with the  vital question of how they can construct their own lives.     PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities,  and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He  focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five  books, including Looking for Lincoln, The American President, and P.T.  Barnum: America's Greatest Showman. He was also writer and co-producer of  more than a dozen documentary films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and  others, including the ten-part PBS series The American President, and the  sixteen part Freedom: A History of US.  Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in  Annandale, New York.  Spring 2014 Pirates, Privateers and Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean FRSEM-UA 538; class # 16278 Instructor: Edgardo Morales  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Pirates, privateers and runaways of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century Caribbean fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. Today, the Jolly Roger --the pirate flag-- is clearly displayed in toys and makes for compelling cinematic moments. In real life, however, flying that flag was a criminal act punishable with the death penalty. How must we think of Francis Drake, the most feared privateer of the 1500s, in the age of Jack Sparrow, the most renown of the fantasy pirates of our days? This class will approach the history of maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might otherwise escape scholarly inquiry. While outsiders often described pirates and privateers as renegades, godless,   murderers and villains, privateer men like Francis Drake,   pirate women like Anne Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at   the very center of important political questions of their age. Students will read academic books such as Villains of All Nations , by the historian Marcus Rediker, as well as original documents dating back to the age of piracy. Prof. EDGARDO PEREZ MORALES graduated with a Ph.D in history from the University of Michigan. He has conducted research on privateers during the Age of Revolutions in archives and libraries in Colombia, Cuba, France, Jamaica, Spain and the United States. He teaches at NYU\u2019s Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.                        Welcome!

The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.          Computer Simulation   (FRSEM-UA 207; class #7071)   Instructor: Charles S. Peskin   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Prerequisites: AP calculus and physics      Since the starting point for any computer simulation is a mathematical model (i.e., a collection of equations that describe the phenomenon to be simulated), the true prerequisite for this seminar is a love of mathematics, especially calculus. Computer simulation is one way that mathematics gets applied to the real world. In this hands-on course, students learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological processes. Examples include the orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of epidemic and endemic diseases in a population, including the evolution of a population in response to an endemic disease; the production of sound by musical instruments; the flow of traffic on a highway or in a city; and the electrical activity of nerves. The seminar meets alternately in a classroom and in a computer laboratory setting. The techniques needed to perform computer simulations and to present the results in terms of elementary graphics, animations, and sounds are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by students working individually or in teams. Topics for student projects may be drawn from those discussed in class as listed above, but students are also free to do other projects that reflect their own interests.     CHARLES S. PESKIN is Silver Professor of Mathematics and Neural Science. His field of research is mathematical modeling and computer simulation applied to biology and medicine. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a former MacArthur Fellow, and a recipient of the Mayor\u2019s Award for Excellence in Science and Technology, as well as the Great Teacher Award of the NYU Alumni Association.        Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature       (FRSEM-UA 210; class #7072)   Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory.     FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and its Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on 20th-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.      The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America      (FRSEM-UA 218; class #7073)   Instructor: John E. Sexton   Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. (and several Thursdays in this time slot; see below)   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.       IMPORTANT: Please note amended meeting schedule for this course in the fall 2012 term. Students who are unable to accommodate both the Tuesday and Thursday classes should not register for the course.     Tuesday, September 4   Thursday, September 6   Tuesday, September 11   Thursday, September 20   Tuesday, October 2   Thursday, October 11   Tuesday, October 23   Tuesday, October 30   Tuesday, November 6   Tuesday, November 13   Tuesday, November 20    Last class: Tuesday, November 27     Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of Church and State; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a 21st-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level.     JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and he has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.      First Amendment Freedom of Expression      (FRSEM-UA 235; class #7074)   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon   Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)    Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources who provide critical information for a story of national importance. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course begins by examining the sharp disagreements over what freedom of speech and press meant in 1789, even as Madison drafted the amendment. Students will learn about the struggle against seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. The course will look at freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, political dissent that advocates overthrow of the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. He teaches courses on First Amendment law in which he focuses on freedom of speech and freedom of the press. His most recent book, Ellery\u2019s Protest, tells the story of one of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of the last century, Abington School District v. Schempp, in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.    School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies      (FRSEM-UA 255; class #7075)   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The decades of the 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader.     ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is an Associate Curator in the Bobst Library and has taught in the English Department of the Faculty of Arts and Science. He is currently the librarian for Social Work in the Social Sciences Department. First as a student and then as faculty, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.      Disease and History: Epidemics and Pandemics from Antiquity to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 265; class #13807)   Instructor: Richard Hull   Thursday, 11:00 a.m. \u2013 1:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     This seminar focuses on the historical dimensions of several major epidemics that profoundly affected human societies in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Students identify each epidemic and explore its causes, origins, means of transmission, efforts at containment, and impacts on societies, particularly on their cultural development. They examine representations of the epidemic in the arts, media, and literature of the period, as well as assess the effects of each disease on demographics, religions, economies, and lifestyles. To what extent did an epidemic, or plague, accelerate or retard fundamental changes in human relationships within societies and between them, and the ways people viewed themselves and their universe? Students read and discuss several core texts and write a short response paper on each. They also write a brief paper on a disease of their choice and discuss their findings in class.     RICHARD HULL is Professor of History.

Ethics, Pointillism, Epidemiology, and Epistemology: EPEE Duelling with Health Science Information      (FRSEM-UA 278; class #13804)   Instructor: Ralph Katz   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The common citizen is well challenged\u2014if not overly challenged\u2014trying to deal with the flood of scientific health information as presented in the media. \u201cScientific\u201d health findings of this week seem routinely to conflict with the \u201cscientific\u201d health findings of last week. As the movie theme song first asked so poignantly over three decades ago, \u201cWhat\u2019s it all about, Alfie?\u201d This course explores that question as it relates to scientific health information as used both by individuals to make personal life decisions about health behaviors, and by society to protect its citizens via court decisions and governmental regulations. Concepts from the fields of ethics, art, and science are central to readings and discussions focused on how to make sense of it all. Beginning with the history and foundation concepts of bioethics and epidemiology, the course provides a framework for understanding this flood of scientific health information, i.e., what are the strengths and limitations (and misuses) of this free flow of scientific health findings in our democratic \u201cinstant, electronic news\u201d world. Textbooks and videos cover background on the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, truth, polar bears, limes, and rubbish. As the major course assignment, each student writes a newspaper-style \u201cop-ed\u201d article, backed up by an annotated bibliography.     RALPH V. KATZ is Professor of Epidemiology and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Health Promotion in the NYU College of Dentistry. He has been the Director of the NYU Oral Cancer RAAHP (Research on Adolescent and Adult Health Promotion) Center and leads a current study investigating whether minorities are less willing to participate in biomedical studies as research subjects and, if so, why. Having served on the National Tuskegee Legacy Committee, he was a Presidential Invitee to the White House for President Clinton\u2019s 1997 apology to the African-American community. His epidemiologic research has ranged from oral disease studies to the development of epidemiologic research methods. In addition to his dental degree, he holds a master\u2019s degree in public health and a Ph.D. in epidemiology.      From the Rise of Christianity to Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia      (FRSEM-UA 282; class #7076)   Instructor: Edward W. Lehman   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The second decade of the new millennium has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism. We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive moral and social transformations which have occurred in Western civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity , which focuses on formative developments during the first four centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism . We then examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America , which paints a much more upbeat picture of what is happening around us.     EDWARD W. LEHMAN is Professor Emeritus of Sociology. His research interests include political sociology, cultural sociology, and sociological theory. He is the author of Coordinating Health Care: Explorations in Interorganizational Relations, Political Society: A Macrosociology of Politics , and The Viable Polity. He is coeditor of A Sociological Reader in Complex Organizations . He has edited and published Autonomy and Order: A Communitarian Anthology , a collection of original essays by 15 authors that explores how the fraying of shared moral understandings and the erosion of communal bonds affect our capacity to balance individual rights and collective responsibilities.      Communications and Human Values      (FRSEM-UA 291; class #7077)   Instructor: Richard D. Heffner   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      This seminar is an intellectual inquiry into the development of American public policy as it relates to mass communications. It is not a practicum, not a \u201chow-to\u201d course about film and television, nor about the media generally. The seminar\u2019s purpose is instead to analyze how much of our sense of what it means to be an American early in the 21st century has been molded by the media\u2014first print and now increasingly electronic\u2014with particular reference to their socializing and value-legitimating content. To learn about and then deal appropriately and reasonably with such media power, students are asked first to identify their own respective approaches to the role of the state and its proper relationship to the individual through class discussion of such readings as Walter Lippmann\u2019s Public Opinion , Robert Merton\u2019s Mass Persuasion , J. S. Mill\u2019s On Liberty , Herman Melville\u2019s Billy Budd , and Neil Postman\u2019s Amusing Ourselves to Death ; of such films as Hearts and Minds, JFK , and Fahrenheit 9/11 ; and of the increasingly unfair and unbalanced rants and raves of America\u2019s newer communications outlets. Finally, class emphasis is placed on analyzing and resolving such contemporary media issues as a Fairness Doctrine (the real or imagined \u201cchilling effect\u201d of a requirement for media fairness and balance); cameras in the courts (do televised trials enhance justice, or instead create a \u201cmobocracy,\u201d with trial by a new jury of public opinion?); the importance of journalistic \u201cprivilege\u201d; and media self-regulation (can there in fact be meaningful voluntary self-discipline in a free market, free speech, mass media-driven society?).     RICHARD D. HEFFNER is Producer/Moderator of the weekly public television series The Open Mind , which he began over half a century ago. Earlier a broadcaster and executive at ABC, NBC, and CBS, in 1962 he became the Founding General Manager of New York\u2019s pioneering Channel 13. Trained as an American historian, he is the author of A Documentary History of the United States (1952; Eighth Revised and Updated Edition\u2014with Alexander Heffner\u20142009) and the editor of Tocqueville\u2019s Democracy in America (1956; reissued 2010). His newest books are a collaboration entitled Conversations with Elie Wiesel (2001) and his paperback edition of As They Saw It\u2026 A Half Century of Conversations from the Open Mind (2003). From 1974 to 1994 Mr. Heffner served as Chairman of the film industry\u2019s voluntary classification and rating system in Hollywood, commuting from Rutgers, where he has been University Professor of Communications and Public Policy since 1964.      The Crusades and Their Legacy      (FRSEM-UA 296; class #7078)   Instructor: Jill N. Claster   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     The Crusades, which began at the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters in the history of the interactions among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. The Crusades began as religious wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city of Jerusalem. The unexpected result of the First Crusade was the conquest of lands in the Middle East known as the Latin Kingdom, or Outremer, the lands across the sea. For two hundred years, against all odds, the Crusaders managed to keep some of their newly won lands. They lost more of them with every passing decade, however, until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the Middle East was lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades themselves, the background which made it possible for thousands of people for over two centuries to join the crusading movement, and the religious ardor which informed the Crusades. It also focuses on life in the Latin Kingdom in the Holy Land, particularly on the relations among the three great religious groups and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for their own. Most of all, the course addresses many issues that are crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a Christian holy war and the nature of jihad; the question of whether the Crusades were the first manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East; and the centuries-long legacy of the crusading era.     JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the Crusader era extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 (2009).

She was the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Distinguished Alumni Award by the Alumni Association of NYU.      Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos?      (FRSEM-UA 306; class #7079)   Instructor: Jorge G. Casta\u00f1eda   Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30 p.m.-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar focuses on several aspects of Latin America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today. It takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and vigor of civil society today. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present.     JORGE D. CASTA\u00d1EDA returned to NYU in fall 2003 as Global Distinguished Professor of Politics and Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

Documentary Theater      (FRSEM-UA 351; class #7081)   Instructor: Carol Martin   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     This course explores the subject matter, history and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary theatre. By analyzing the content, structure and dramatic devices of a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of human behavior from everyday life to important political events in the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We will read plays about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the cover up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the simulated and the virtual?     CAROL MARTIN is Professor of Drama at NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts. She writes on documentary theatre, contemporary American and Japanese performance, as well as on performance and globalization. Her essays and interviews have appeared in academic journals in the U.S. and abroad and in the New York Times and have been translated into French, Polish, Chinese, and Japanese. Her most recent book is Dramaturgy of the Real on the World Stage .      Literary Theory and Its Applications      (FRSEM-UA 355; class #7082)   Instructor: John Maynard   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Students in this seminar will read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the 20th century to the present. They will learn to consider different approaches to literature. They will complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities.     JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature.

From Mind to Brain and Back Again      (FRSEM-UA 357; class #16356)   Instructor: Joseph LeDoux   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     What is mind? Is it a system of impulses or something changeable? This paraphrase of a Bart Simpson remark captures one of the great debates in history: to what extent are we hard-wired as opposed to shaped by experience? Several hundred years ago, fundamental questions such as these were addressed by philosophers. The birth of psychology in the late 19th century gave us ways of studying the mind scientifically rather than simply speculating about it. Modern neuroscience gives us a new approach, one in which we use discoveries about the brain to understand who we are and why we are that way. What have we learned? And does this approach enhance (or diminish) our sense of who we are? In this course we address these questions, looking at the issues both historically and in terms of modern discoveries. We use the topic of emotions, and their relation to the brain, as a window on the broader problem of mind and brain.      JOSEPH LEDOUX is a University Professor and Henry and Lucy Moses Professor of Science, and a member of the Center for Neural Science and of the Department of Psychology at NYU.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome 1590-1680: The Age of Caravaggio and Bernini      (FRSEM-UA 366; class #13805)   Instructor: Guy Walton   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Recent biographies of Caravaggio and Bernini provide the basis for this course, which takes papal patronage of the arts in seventeenth-century Rome as its subject. We will explore the reigns of Sixtus V, Paul V, Urban VIII, Innocent X, and Alexander VII\u2014all \u201cbuilder\u201d popes from a time when Rome was considered the artistic capital of Europe\u2014and the masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture and city planning they sponsored. In addition to Caravaggio and Bernini, whose clay models will be exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the fall, we will study (among others) Borromini and Pietro da Cortona. During the first weeks of the semester, students will present short biographies of a number of the outstanding personalities of the Counter Reformation and Baroque, from saints to nobles to prelates. Particular stress will be placed on those messages, religious and secular, that were specifically expressed in the rebuilding of the ancient and early Christian city of Rome and its monuments, including such magisterial works as St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, along with many city squares, churches, monasteries, villas and palaces. These remarkable monuments of art and architecture will provide the subjects for the substantial term papers required for the course at the end of the term.     GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles (London and Chicago 1986).      The Writer in New York      (FRSEM-UA 367; class #8879)   Instructor: Vincent Passaro   Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy.     VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content (2002). His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, the Nation, the New York Times Magazine, and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.      Welcome to College: The Novel      (FRSEM-UA 371; class #7083)   Instructor: Carol Sternhell   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we will read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We will discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students will write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it.

Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies      (FRSEM-UA 377; class #8167)   Instructor: Liana Theodoratou   Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The mythic figure of Medea has held our imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile, the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting, cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present in order to think about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.     LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.

The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right      (FRSEM-UA 379; class #7084)   Instructor: Michael E. Makover   Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester.     MICHAEL E. MAKOVER, M.D., is Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine at the NYU School of Medicine, Attending Physician at the NYU Medical Center, and in active practice of internal medicine and rheumatology.

New York City: A Survey, 1609\u20131898      (FRSEM-UA 383; class #7086)   Instructor: Leo Hershkowitz   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.-12 p.m.     In this study of New York City, we shall look for answers to several basic questions. For example, how did the city become the \u201cWorld\u2019s Capital\u201d? Why is New York so different from other American cities? Why is it the center of art, music, finance, science? Is New York an American city? How have artists, writers, and travelers viewed New York? How do New Yorkers see New York? What is its future? This is also a voyage into unknown New York by means of archival sources largely overlooked by historians, but which are important to understanding the complexity, as well as the excitement, that is New York history. Many of these primary sources are now in the Tamiment Library at NYU, while others are at the New York Historical Society and such city agencies as the offices of the County Clerk, the Municipal Archives, and Register of New York County. The materials found there are basic to the lectures, discussions, and students\u2019 papers in the class. There will also be a walking tour of lower Manhattan and visits to a number of institutions where archival materials are housed.     LEO HERSHKOWITZ, Professor of History at Queens College, CUNY, has written widely on aspects of New York City history. His work has also included testimony before the U.S. Supreme Court (1997) and consultancy to the New York Attorney General, the County Clerk of New York County, and the Appellate Division of the State of New York, First Department.

Computational Thought      (FRSEM-UA 385; class #7087)   Instructor: Dennis Shasha   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience     Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style will combine straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students will make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, evolutionarily inspired robots, DNA computing, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.     DENNIS E. SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science. His fields of research include computational biology, technologically enhanced privacy, and pattern matching. On the way to becoming a computer scientist, he studied linguistics, engineering, and philosophy. You can find some of his puzzles on the Scientific American website : www.sciam.com .      Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine &amp; Other Sources      (FRSEM-UA 393; class #7089)   Instructor: Michele Shedlin   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we will focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This will guide our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students will become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort.

America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II      (FRSEM-UA 405; class #7094)   Instructor: James B. Sitrick   Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950. Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than 60-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the  insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration.

Branding: People, Places, Things      (FRSEM-UA 422; class #7096)   Instructor: Richard L. Lewis   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     As thinking people, we want to believe that we are resistant to branding and its most obvious tool, advertising. Yet both penetrate: occasionally honestly, sometimes deviously, often entertainingly. How do they do it, even when our guards are up? Why do we revere Apple, feel wary of American Apparel, admire Google, and resent BP? Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us, and companies often don\u2019t really know what works, or how; sometimes, they are just lucky. Brands also have a darker side, according to some social commentators, and may lead to mass consumer hypnosis. This course analyzes what makes brands tick, how they\u2019re created, and how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and politicians, taking a short look back at the creation of \u201cObama Nation\u201d and a long look back to 1968, when many of today\u2019s tools were developed. We then cross the moat to our own lives, asking ourselves: how are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own reputations; that is, our own \u201cbrands\u201d?     RICHARD L.LEWIS is an independent marketing doctor who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/Day, leading the ABSOLUT vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.      Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music, Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition      (FRSEM-UA 427; class # 7097)   Instructor: Gary Marcus   Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     A look at music and video games from the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music? Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel experiment.     GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader ; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .      Trials of the Century      (FRSEM-UA 434; class #7100)   Instructor: Jack Ford   Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the \u201cScottsboro Boys,\u201d will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the \u201cChicago Seven.\u201d And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes \u201cMonkey Trial.\u201d Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law.     JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School.

History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S.      (FRSEM-UA 437; class #7102)   Instructor: Jack Salzman   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.     This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese-Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory.     JACK SALZMAN has been the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching award, and twice has been awarded a Fulbright Professorship.

He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.      The \u201cLong 19th Century\u201d: Sixty Glorious Years, 1876\u20131936      (FRSEM-UA 439; class #13806)   Instructor: Rena Mueller   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The historical narrative of the \u201clong century,\u201d as defined by British historian Eric Hobsbawm, referring to the period between the years 1789 and 1914, has been extended conceptually in the last two decades by the work of Giovanni Arrighi. But this idea of the \u201clong century\u201d when applied to the period 1876-1936 holds for music as well: for comprehensive brilliance and diversity, the period from 1876 to 1936 is unsurpassed in the history of Western music. The two decades from 1894 to 1914 saw the composition\u2014and frequently unruly first performances\u2014of Schoenberg\u2019s Second String Quartet, Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht , and Pierrot Lunaire ; of Stravinsky\u2019s Firebird, Petrouchka , and Le Sacre du Printemps ; and the early works of Berg, Webern, and Bart\u00f3k. Richard Strauss\u2019s operas Salome and Elektra jockeyed for place with L\u00e9har\u2019s The Merry Widow and Oscar Straus\u2019s The Chocolate Soldier , among others.   This class will explore the \u201cisms\u201d most often associated with artistic and literary movements but quickly appropriated by music of the time: Romanticism, Post-Romanticism, Impressionism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Futurism, Positivism, and Dadaism. Four broad themes\u2014musical musical evolution and revolution, social structure, literary and musical nationalism, and anxiety\u2014will form the core of the class. In particular, we will investigate the two cities where modernism was born but where it was only uncomfortably at home, the polarities of 19th-century literary, artistic, and musical environments in Vienna (the negative \u201cfin-de-si\u00e8cle\u201d) and Paris (the positive \u201cla belle \u00c9poque\u201d), paying special attention to the works of Schnitzler, Freud, Jarry, Apollinaire, the Sezession, Der Blaue Reiter, Die Br\u00fccke, the Bauhaus, the Fauves, L\u2019art nouveau, and Cubism.

Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature      (FRSEM-UA 440; class # 7103)   Instructor: Saul Rosenberg   Monday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through the study of stories, novels, nonfiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later 19th century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the 20th century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme.     SAUL ROSENBERG, who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine.

Three Moments in Witchcraft      (FRSEM-UA 441; class #7104)   Instructor: Laura Levine   Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.     In I Samuel 28, when King Saul wants to know what to do about the army of Philistines gathering at his door, he seeks out the witch of Endor to conjure up the dead Samuel to answer his questions. Renaissance commentators puzzled over what it is that the witch summoned up: a devil? The real Samuel? \u201cAn illusion\u201d says Reginald Scot in his Discoverie, the first book in the period to offer a theory of witch-hunts as scapegoating. For him, the witch of Endor was a ventriloquist. King James I of England also saw the scene as one of theater, but for him it was the devil playing Samuel. What lies at the root of the association between witchcraft and theater during the period? When Spenser has his heroes in Book I of The Faerie Queene strip the witch Duessa to look at her naked body, how is he commenting on the theatricality of judicial procedures? Why does The Winter\u2019s Tale \u2019s Leontes throw Paulina out of his chambers as a \u201cmankind witch\u201d? This course seeks to answer such questions, beginning with the Bible, focusing on the Renaissance and ending with the story of a mouse who was a witch and Balanchine\u2019s re-creation of the moment as a ballet.     LAURA LEVINE is an Associate Professor of Theater Studies in Drama at Tisch, where she teaches courses in Shakespeare, Renaissance studies, and autobiography and solo performance.

Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present      (FRSEM-UA 442; class #16512)   Instructor: William Klein   Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as it did in the case of Galileo)? Are there truths that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, and \u017di\u017eek.     WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of The Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of political discourse in Liberal Studies, and conducts seminars on a variety of topics for the honors program in CAS. He is currently writing a study on the history and theory of sedition. In previous lives he worked as a ghost writer, an editor and a carpenter (hence the title of a recent piece on one of Italy's great artists, Franca Ghitti: \"Naive Notes on Franca's Nails by a Former Carpenter\"). In 2011-12 he taught for NYU in Florence.       Financial Systems as Social Forms: Comparing Conventional and Islamic Finance      (FRSEM-UA 444; class #8203)   Instructor: Mary Poovey   Wednesday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Financial systems direct the flow of capital between savers and borrowers, but they also reflect and help shape contemporary values and understandings of the self and others. In this course we compare and contrast the theories implicit in the financial systems of the United States and most other Western countries and those implicit in  Islamic financial institutions, which now exist in many parts of the world. The most basic distinction between the two systems involves assumptions about the economy and the individuals who participate in it. In the US, the economy is assumed to govern itself by the law of supply and demand, and individuals are assumed to be rational agents who seek to maximize their own profit and minimize personal loss. Credit\u2014and therefore debt\u2014is central to the US economy because interest-based financing is the primary mechanism for transferring money from one party to another.      In Islamic finance, by contrast, commercial transactions are governed by Shari\u2019ah law because the economy, like every other facet of life, is subject to the commands of Allah and because human reason is considered fallible. While Shari\u2019ah law bans one fundamental part of the US system\u2014interest\u2014it does recognize the principle of profit and loss sharing, and special financial instruments have been developed to enable individuals and institutions to form partnerships, transfer capital, and generate profits.      By comparing these two systems and the practices they require, we seek to understand how financial systems mediate competing values in an increasingly interconnected global context.       MARY POOVEY is the Samuel Rudin University Professor in the Humanities and Professor of English at New York University. She received a Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence from the College, and she was also recognized for excellence in teaching by Swarthmore College.

This course grows out of her current project, which is a co-authored book exploring the ways financial instruments and institutions shape the ways their users understand themselves and interact with the world.      From St. Petersburg to Paris and New York: George Balanchine and the Politics of Modernism      (FRSEM-UA 445; class #8204)   Instructor: Jennifer Homans   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course is a biography of modernism, told through the life and work of the ballet master George Balanchine. We trace Balanchine\u2019s path and artistic development from his birth in Imperial St. Petersburg in 1904 through the political and artistic tumult of the Russian Revolution, to Paris in the 1920s, where he collaborated with Serge Diaghilev and artists, dancers, and composers working at the forefront of modernism. From 1933 until his death in 1983, Balanchine lived in New York, where he and other \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists transformed the cultural life of the city. What did Balanchine\u2019s dances have to do with the political culture of Petersburg, Paris and New York? Can we trace the relationship between his life and his art?     Readings will range from history to memoir and biography. Students will also attend live performances and study dances and other forms of art at Lincoln Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Guggenheim Museum of Art. Grades will be based on weekly writing assignments, class participation, and an in-class presentation analyzing a dance or other work of art in its historical context.     JENNIFER HOMANS is the author of Apollo\u2019s Angels: A History of Ballet (2010) and the dance critic for the New Republic . She has also published with the New York Times, the New York Review of Books , and the Guardian , among others.

Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature      (FRSEM-UA 449; class #13813)   Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld   Thursday, 6:20-8:50 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War-era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Phillip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history.     EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

He received his BA from Columbia College and his JD from NYU Law School and is also an attorney specializing in Corporate Restructuring.      \u201cLaboratories for Democracy\u201d: Making American Cities Better      (FRSEM-UA 456; class #8256)   Instructor: Eric Gioia   Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     At a time when many Americans have become increasingly frustrated with what government has produced, there are places that are getting it done right. Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today.     ERIC GIOIA, ESQ. is an attorney with over eleven years of experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P.

Literature, Economics, and History in 18th-Century Britain      (FRSEM-UA 460; class #8941)   Instructor: Kevin Brine   Wednesday, 4:55-7:25 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 5:00-6:00 p.m.     Few authors have had more influence on modern thought than Adam Smith, Samuel Johnson, and Edward Gibbon. Smith defined the terms by which we understand modern economics; Johnson taught us how to read English literature; and Gibbon pointed the way to modern historiography with an account of the Roman Empire that has never been surpassed. All three were members of the same Literary Club, founded by Johnson and the painter Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1764. In 1791, Club member James Boswell published the remarkable biography Life of Johnson , which vividly portrays the intellectual life of Georgian Britain through an astounding wealth of anecdotes, intellectual repartee, and the personal details of an unforgettable and larger-than- life Samuel Johnson. In this course we read selections from Life of Johnson , Smith\u2019s The Wealth of Nations (1776), and Gibbon\u2019s The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire (1776), with an eye toward the contemporary relevance of these works. Students come to know Samuel Johnson as though he were a family friend, gain a deep understanding of Adam Smith\u2019s concept of how a modern economy works, and see the ancient grandeur of Rome through the eyes of one of the world\u2019s most influential historians. Working in small groups, students learn to present their ideas in a seminar setting and improve their writing skills with assignments geared toward expressing their ideas and insights.     KEVIN R.

Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber      (FRSEM-UA 461; class #8960)   Instructor: Jing Wang   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.      The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English.     JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

Oral History of Irish America      (FRSEM-UA 462; class #8971)   Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. -12:00 noon    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to documenting the lived experience of Irish Americans and their communities in a small class setting. The course reviews the methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, specific interviewing and research techniques, and the opportunity to create an original public history document that will be deposited in the Archives of Irish America at NYU for use by scholars in a variety of research projects. Students will be assigned an interview subject chosen from the Irish American community in New York City. To date we have interviewed parish priests from the Bronx, an Oscar and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright and director, a National Book Award-winning novelist, as well as actors, musicians, teachers, and Wall Street executives. In addition to the interview, the course includes classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises. The final project (which will undergo careful editing and numerous rewrites) includes a biography and full finding aid to the interview for the archive, as well as web content that will be launched on the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History website. This course offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers.     LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America.

Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives.      Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\"      (FRSEM-UA 463; class #14260)   Instructor: Shimon Dotan   Friday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions--the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them.      SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival (The Smile of the Lamb), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director (Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival (You Can Thank Me Later).

Literature of the Absurd      (FRSEM-UA 464; class #14251)   Instructor: Thomas Bishop   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The absurd sensibility has profoundly marked writers of many countries and languages since the start of the 20th century. The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950's in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued world-wide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, Stoppard, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post-World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of human\u2019s condition on this earth and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the landmark Theater of the Absurd, called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages [which were] swept away\u2026found wanting\u2026and discredited.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary and the seminal depiction of the absurd for his century; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kertesz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni, Resnais, Godard, and more recently, Woody Allen. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, an era that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and with it human\u2019s ability for the first time of destroying itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd would be a dominant stance, even if the absurd if often treated with devastating humor.   TOM BISHOP is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature, and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at NYU. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization.

Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel      (FRSEM-UA 466; class #14269)   Instructor: Ilya Kriger   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we will try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, will be supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others.      ILYA KLIGER is assistant professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explores the parallel developments of the notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.      The Statue of Liberty: Icon of America      (FRSEM-UA 467; class #14253)   Instructor: Edward Berenson   Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The Statue of Liberty is perhaps the most beloved of all American symbols. Yet no one living in 1885, when the crated monument arrived in New York Harbor, could have foreseen the central place the Statue of Liberty would come to occupy in the American imagination. Most Americans had never heard of the French intellectuals who proposed to build it, and many thought the whole idea presumptuous and bizarre. The statue\u2019s supporters feared it would never go up. The course will begin with Liberty\u2019s uncertain origins in French art and politics and then consider the trials of its reception and construction in New York Harbor. We will see how the statue\u2019s symbolically indistinct, neoclassical form has allowed Americans to interpret its meaning in diverse ways: as representing the emancipation of the slaves, Tocqueville's ideal of orderly liberty, opportunity for \"huddled masses,\" and, in the years since 9/11, the freedom and resilience of the United States and New York City in the face of terror. We will also examine the statue\u2019s prominent role in American popular culture. About midway through the semester, the class will take the ferry to Liberty Island and climb to the statue\u2019s crown.     EDWARD BERENSON is professor of history and director of the Institute of French Studies at NYU. In 1999, he won the American Historical Association\u2019s Eugene Asher Distinguished Teaching Award. He is the author or editor of six books, the most recent of which are Heroes of Empire: Five Charismatic Men and the Conquest of Africa (2010) and The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story (2012).       Schools in the Greek and Roman World      (FRSEM-UA 468; class #14255)   Instructor: Raffaella Cribiore   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      This course will give students knowledge of ancient schooling in the Greek and Roman worlds and will cover liberal arts education (in its three levels, primary, grammatical, and rhetorical) and schools of medicine. Some scholars have recently maintained that the network of schools in the ancient world was so puny that the levels of illiteracy were extremely high. Yet it is important to take into account that it is difficult to identify schools because they were usually not housed in buildings designated for this purpose, often occupied private quarters, and education went on in the open air or within the family. At the end of the course students will realize that much caution is needed in evaluating education in the ancient world.     The course will be based on the literary sources, the school exercises from Greek and Roman Egypt, and on archaeological sources. Students will examine evidence regarding schools that have recently come to light in Rome and Greek Alexandria. They will pay special attention to the Greek school found in Egypt in the Dakhla Oasis through the excavation sponsored by New York University.     RAFFAELLA CRIBIORE is a professor in the Department of Classics and is considered an expert in ancient education. His first book was Writing, Teachers and Students in Greco-Roman Egypt (Scholars Press 1996), which contained a catalogue of 406 school exercises that emerged from the sands of Egypt. This book was followed by Gymnastics of the Mind: Greek Education in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt (Princeton 2001). This book was awarded the Goodwin Prize in 2003, the most prestigious award in the field of Classics. In 2006, Professor Cribiore wrote, in collaboration with Roger Bagnall, Women\u2019s Letters from Ancient Egypt, 300BC-AD 800 (Michigan University Press). In 2007 he published again with Princeton University Press The School of Libanius in Late Antique Antioch , which studied a very prestigious school of rhetoric in Syria.      Pagans and Christians in Roman Egypt      (FRSEM-UA 469; class #14256)   Instructor: Nicola Aravecchia   Friday, 9:30-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This course explores the subject of paganism in late Roman Egypt and the role that Christianity played in shaping a new religious, social, and cultural environment between the third and sixth centuries CE. The goal is to gain an understanding of the process by which the new religion spread in a heavily Hellenized part of the Mediterranean world, influenced by Classical culture and religious beliefs but also attached to its traditional religious heritage. The seminar will touch upon issues of religious and cultural resistance, imperial involvement, official propaganda, proselytism, and syncretic manifestations of devotional practice. Attention will also be paid to the variety of forms in which Christianity (and modes of Christian life) developed in Egypt, expressive of a complex but deeply fascinating world of ideas and beliefs. The religious topography of pre-Christian Egypt, in which temples were prime visual landmarks, will be examined and compared with the dramatic changes brought by the appearance and dissemination of Christian places of cult and monastic life.     NICOLA ARAVECCHIA is Clinical Assistant Professor of Archaeology at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World and the academic director of New York University\u2019s semester abroad program in Egypt. His research interests concern Egypt in Late Antiquity and focus on the origins and development of Early Christian art and architecture in that region of the Mediterranean world. He also has a strong interest in the application of models of spatial analysis to archaeology, with the goal of studying how public and private spaces were constructed and used in antiquity and how they affected social relationships. He is the field director of the archaeological mission of Ain el-Gedida, a fourth-century settlement in the Dakhla Oasis of Upper Egypt, where he has been excavating since 2006. Currently, he is working on the final archaeological report of the 2006-2008 excavation seasons. He is also the deputy field director of the archaeological mission of Amheida in the Dakhla Oasis.      Picasso: Poetry and Invention      (FRSEM-UA 470; class #14257)   Instructor: Pepe Karmel   Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 9:30-10:30 a.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.)      Pablo Picasso is widely recognized as the greatest artist of the 20th century. But what is it that makes his work so powerful and influential? This seminar will explore Picasso\u2019s achievement in depth, looking at paintings, sculptures, drawings, and prints from all eight decades of his career. On one hand, we will look at the astonishing series of new formal languages that he invented between 1907 through 1957. On the other, we will look at Picasso\u2019s remarkable work as a figurative storyteller and poet, exploring the fundamental human emotions of joy and sorrow, love and desire, alienation and aggression. Along with texts by biographers, critics, and art historians, we will read works by poets such as, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Cocteau, and Paul Eluard,who were his closest friends.      PEPE KARMEL teaches in the Department of Art History, New York University. His book, Picasso and the Invention of Cubism , was published by Yale University Press in 2003.

He is currently working on a history of abstract art.       A Nation of War      (FRSEM-UA 471; class #14398)   Instructor: Nikhil Singh   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This seminar will explore a controversial proposition: to what extent is the US a nation defined by commitments to and capacities for making war? Coming of age in the years since 9/11, many of you will not have known a time when the nation was not at war.      We will explore societal interests and attitudes that sustain an interest in war. For example, wars are commonly presented to the general public as necessary to preserve security, and ironically as a means toward peace. In the 1950s President Eisenhower warned of the rise of a \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d that grew independent of any strategic or security interest. Some have argued that recent wars have been motivated by struggles over resources, particularly oil.      In the contemporary moment, publics are shielded from the consequences of war and thus may have different perspectives from combatants, soldiers and casualties of war. Wars can both unify a people and sharpen domestic political conflicts and societal divisions.      We will use selected course readings and documentary screenings to explore a range of social, philosophical and personal standpoints on America\u2019s wars past, present and future in an effort to answer an age-old question: \u201cwar, what is it good for?\u201d     NIKHIL PAL SINGH is Associate Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and History. He is a recent winner of NYU\u2019s Martin Luther King, Jr. teaching award.

He is the author of the prize-winning book, Black is a Country: Race and the Unfinished Struggle for Democracy , and is currently completing a work entitled Exceptional Empire: Race and War in US Globalism .      21st Century Literature: Methods, Materials, Maps      (FRSEM-UA 473; class #14399)   Instructor: Elaine Freedgood   Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     In this course we will read a selection of novels, poetry, and journalism written in the last twelve years that will help us explore the issues raised in the course\u2019s subtitle: \u201cmethods, materials and maps.\u201d The methods writers use in the twenty-first century to depict internal and external worlds, including realism, postmodernism, digital operations of chance and data mining, and poetry deviate significantly from our ideas of the lyric and the personal. Materials include illustrations\u2014the graphic novel and the comic, the artist\u2019s book, electronic media, and self-published zines. What is the geography of current world literature? What is global and/or local about it? The course will include \u201cfield trips\u201d to poetry and prose readings, book stores, and exhibits of printed and digital matter. Writers will include Indra Sinha, Chris Ware, Young Hae-Chang, Orhan Pamuk, Maureen McLane, Ian MacEwan, Karenn Tei Yamashita, Jesmyn Ward, Dexter Filkins, and Ed Roberson.      ELAINE FREEDGOOD is the author of Victorian Writing about Risk: Imagining a Safe England in a Dangerous World (Cambridge 2000) and The Ideas in Things: Fugitive Meaning in the Victorian Novel (Chicago 2006), and also the editor of Factory Production in Victorian Britain (Oxford 2003). She is currently working on a book about fictionality, reference and metalepsis.      What is College For?      (FRSEM-UA 474; class #14400)   Instructor: Trace Jordan   Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It will also prompt you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the 21st century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we will study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally \u2013 and most importantly \u2013 how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment?     TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the Morse Academic Plan, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.      Why Lincoln Matters: Re-Envisioning the Politically Possible      (FRSEM-UA 475; class #14401)   Instructor: Philip Kunhardt   Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How was a man with less than a year of formal education able to become one of the nation\u2019s most salient political actors? Coinciding with the 2012 presidential election, and with the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, this seminar will involve students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American presidencies. In an effort to understand why his memory still matters, and what contemporary political leaders can learn from his example, we will examine Lincoln\u2019s core writings and speeches for historical context, literary and political merit, and impact on the thinking of the American public. We will look at Lincoln\u2019s role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric, and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How was he influenced by other figures around him\u2014southerners, abolitionists, former slaves, and social conservatives? And how did he learn to use words so effectively to help produce social transformation? Lessons and warnings applicable to today will enter into our intensive group discussion. In papers and presentations students will examine aspects of presidential leadership of most interest to them and develop their writing and communication skills. In addition to Lincoln\u2019s published words, drawn from Roy Basler, Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings , texts will include David H. Donald, Lincoln ; Eric Foner, The Fiery Trial: Lincoln and Slavery ; ibid, Our Lincoln ; James Oakes, The Radical and the Republican ; Douglas Wilson, Honor\u2019s Voice ; and ibid, Lincoln\u2019s Sword . Students may also read a book on the American presidency as an institution, and on Barack Obama and/or his opposing candidate in the 2012 elections.

Swing Counties 2012: The Bush-Obama America      (FRSEM-UA 479; class #16513)   Instructor: David Dent   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     George Bush and Barack Obama are two very different leaders. Yet they have 272 counties in common. George Bush won those counties in 2000 and 2004 and Barack Obama won them in 2008. This course explores American politics and the electoral process through the prism of swing counties and voters. How do such voters and counties exist in this age of ideological polarization? Readings will include Dreams from My Father, Red State Blue State , among other articles and books that explore swing voters. Students will write two Op Ed pieces related to the concept of swing voters and complete a final project.      DAVID J.

Gender, Sexuality and the Law      (FRSEM-UA 480; class #16699)   Instructor: Shelley Fischel   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What's the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments.     SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009.

Cannibalism      (FRSEM-UA 481; class # 16700)   Instructor: Dylon Robbins   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     Western thought teaches us that people who eat people are \u201cbad.\u201d Indeed, the notion of cannibalism is a recurring concern in the history of ideas regarding the primitive, the animalistic, the monstrous, or any of the other classifications frequently invoked to mark others, regardless of their actual culinary preferences. An extended reflection on cannibalism as an intellectual phenomenon suggests how people eating people, or at least the possibility of it, says a great deal about those that do not. Interesting, as well, is the fact that, in some regions of the Caribbean and Brazil, ideas regarding cannibalism have made an important turn, such that the cannibal has become a provocative affirmation of self. The aim of this course is to think about cannibalism, not, as it often is, as a theme for anthropologists and ethnographers, but rather as an intellectual problem that has enjoyed a very long life in the history of ideas about self. In this course, we shall revisit a selection of texts regarding cannibalism from Columbus\u2019 diaries to the present, and including many noteworthy and fascinating interventions about the idea of cannibalism by, among others, Montaigne, Shakespeare, Cabeza de Vaca, Hans Staden, Goya, Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo, Fern\u00e1ndez Retamar, Oswald de Andrade, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, and Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.

Audiovisual Stories: Creative Documentary Filmmaking in Latin America (2000\u20132012)      (FRSEM-UA 483; class #17048)   Instructor: Alexandra Falek   Thursday, 12:30-3:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     Creative documentaries present their subject in a poetic manner; they experiment with the formal and conceptual possibilities of storytelling by proposing an artistic engagement and (re)presentation of the questions, problems and ideas they explore. In Latin America, they are a vital part of long-standing film traditions. This seminar offers students the opportunity to acquire practical and perceptive skills related to the interpretation and analysis of recent creative documentaries made by renowned and new directors. We will examine the use and construction of storytelling elements (visual, aural, emotional, narrative, structural) in each film, always considering pertinent issues related to the film\u2019s particular production, exhibition and distribution contexts. As a way of building a strong foundation for the notions of \u201ccreativity\u201d and \u201cpoetry\u201d in filmmaking, we will make regular reference to seminal essays on classic documentary approaches and strategies. Students will develop critical proficiency by watching films on a regular basis, reading relevant texts by filmmakers, theorists and critics, and writing short exercises and a final project.     ALEXANDRA FALEK has been teaching at NYU since 2001 in the Department of Spanish &amp; Portuguese Languages and Literatures, first as a doctoral student and since 2008, as an Assistant Professor/Faculty Fellow. She was the co-director of Latin American Film Festival at NYU (2011) and the director of Uruguay Film Fest (2011). Her most recent teaching, research and publication explorations focus on documentary filmmaking in Latin America.      Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 484; class #17214)   Instructor: Ulrich Baer   Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship \u2013 the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics will include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of how New York City is an international city that has turned diversity into strength. The seminar will bring in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions \u2013 ranging from activism to business leadership \u2013 may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? How do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? As part of the seminar we will travel to NYU\u2019s Constance Milstein and Family Global Academic Center in Washington, D.C., to visit an international organization, NGO, or federal agency that is engaged globally.

See It, Read It: Photography and Writing in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 486; class #17131)   Instructor: Lourdes D\u00e1vila   Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     What is a photograph? How do we read photographs? How has photography shaped history and fiction, our ideas of the self and of others? The purpose of this course is to analyze the history of photography and its relation with textual productions in XX and XXI century Latin American writers. We will begin by studying how the technology of photography (which arrived in Latin America almost simultaneously with its creation in Europe) contributed to a particular visual construction of Latin America and was incorporated into literary writings from the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern Cone. The main objective of the course will be to analyze the use of photography in literary and extra-literary texts, from texts that use photography as its discursive axis (but without containing real photographs) to texts that play on the page with photographic reproductions. Topics includ: photography and history, photography and archive, photography and madness, photography and the city, photography and memory, and photography and eroticism. We will consider texts and photographs by Roberto Arlt, Leopoldo Lugones, Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, Elena Poniatowska, Mario Bellatin, Ana Mar\u00eda Berecochea, and Paz Err\u00e1zuriz, among others. As we explore how literary authors manipulate photographs on the page or collaborate with photographers, we will look at other international writers, such as W. G. Sebald. This course will count toward the major in Spanish and Latin American Studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.     LOURDES D\u00c1VILA is a member of the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese and a Golden Dozen Teaching Award winner. Since the 1980s, she has written and published widely on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s writing, from Hopscotch to Buenos Aires Buenos Aires to Fantomas Against the Multinational Vampires . Her first book, The Image Arrives on a Verbal Shore , focuses on Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s use of visual language. She is is finishing a book on photography and literature in Latin America, is the editor of the forthcoming essay collection La variable Bellatin , and has worked as a translator since the early eighties, both in the field of art and in literature. Her two latest literary translations are Corner of the Dead , (English to Spanish), a short novel by award-winner Lynn Lurie about the Shining Path in Peru, and Julio Cort\u00e1zar\u2019s Silvalandia (Spanish to English).       The Past\u2019s Presence      (FRSEM-UA 487; class #17132)   Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      How do we remember the past? And what do we learn from it? This course will take up questions of remembering, reflecting on, and writing the past through three lenses. We will begin the semester by reading a selection of African American authors who recast narratives of slavery in contemporary literature. Reading these \u201cneo-slave narratives\u201d will allow us to think about the ways history can be retold in imaginative ways and to explore the complex relationship between nostalgia and critique embodied in the return to the sites of slavery. We will also read works of narrative history and \u201cexperimental\u201d history as a way to think through what counts as meaningful scholarship, whether literary or historical. Finally, students will embark on hands-on research projects of their own design, viewing the past through the authors, texts, locations or institutions that can be recovered by examining primary and archival sources available digitally and/or in New York City. This is a course for those interested in honing their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers, and for those interested in the process of reading, research and writing, their joys and their frustrations.     ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction.

Her research interests and teaching are primarily focused on American and African American literary history, print culture studies, and archival research methods.       Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism      (FRSEM-UA 488; class #17133)   Instructor: William Ambler   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course will study the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the 17th century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied 17th century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential.     WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.      Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis      (FRSEM-UA 489; class #17139)   Instructor: Katherine Smith   Tuesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     This course will take an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses.     KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, Katherine's dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Katherine spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity. An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. Katherine is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled In Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art, which will open in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.      Feeling Beauty: Aesthetics and Cognitive Science      (FRSEM-UA 492; class # 17191)   Instructor: G. Gabrielle Starr   Monday, 9:30 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      Why do the arts\u2014as diverse as they are in form and in the modes by which they appeal to body and mind\u2014move us as powerfully as they do? This course explores this question from three perspectives: from that of the philosophical tradition of aesthetics, from that of cognitive neuroscience, and from the that of the arts themselves. Students will read Plato, Kant, Burke, Keats, Elizabeth Bishop, as well as work by neuroscientists, and will engage works of music and of visual art.     G. Gabrielle Starr is Associate Professor of English and Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the  aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. In addition, Dean Starr has just completed a book entitled Feeling Beauty: Aesthetic Experience in the Brain and Across the Arts.       SPRING 2013       Word and Image      (FRSEM-UA 399; class # 12920)   Instructor: Mark Podwal   Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 10:00-11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem, I Paint What I See, parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and a Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits will be assigned.     MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For 38 years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast this year on PBS.      Drama Criticism: In History and Practice      (FRSEM-UA 459, class # 12923)   Instructor: Ethan Youngerman   Thursday, 2:00 \u2013 4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.     The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play's production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York's newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history.     ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is the Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College and a Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where he's won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the faculty a decade ago. He's also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including: Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play, The Sublet Experiment , ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from The New York Times, The AP, New York Magazine and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU.                           The Early History of God      (FRSEM-UA 472; class # 12927)   Instructor: Mark Smith   Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     Like other areas of human life and experience, gods and goddesses are complex phenomena, requiring study and thinking. This course focuses on how gods and goddesses (deities) \u2013 and divinity more broadly \u2013 were understood in ancient literatures. We will consider Gilgamesh and the Epic of Creation from Mesopotamia, Canaanite myths and legends, and Israel\u2019s Bible/Old Testament, among other texts. This course centers on the \u201cjob description\u201d of gods and goddesses (what deities are and what they have to be able to do to qualify as deities); the emotions of deities (anger, love, fear, etc.); their gender and sexuality; the animals thought to represent them (\u201cemblem animals\u201d); the various relationships of deities to one another and to humans; the divine creation of the world and of humanity; and deities in love and war. The course also addresses \"monotheism\" in ancient Israel, namely, the belief in only one god.   MARK S. SMITH holds the Skirball Chair of Bible and Ancient Near Eastern Studies at New York University. He completed his Ph.D. at Yale in 1985. He has served twice as Lady Davis Visiting Professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.. He was honored as President of the Catholic Biblical Association of America in 2010-2011, and in 2011 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy for Jewish Research. He is also a two-time winner of New York University\u2019s Golden Dozen Award and the recipient of the Frank Moore Cross award for publication awarded by the American Schools of Oriental Research. He has published over eighty articles, including first editions of four minor manuscripts from Cave Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls. He has authored thirteen books and co-authored three others.      Political Theater      (FRSEM-UA 476; class # 12940)   Instructor: Eric Dickson   Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 3:30-4:30 p.m.     This course offers a survey of political theater, and of the use of theatrical elements in practical politics, from the ancient Greeks to the present. How have dramatic depictions of politics changed over time? In what ways have political plays been used to advance political agendas, both by the powerful and by dissidents and protest movements? To what extent can we understand political speeches and political campaigns as essentially theatrical productions? This course offers an interdisciplinary perspective on these questions. In a typical week, students will read one full-length play, accompanied by appropriate readings from political science or social psychology. Through these readings, writing assignments, and class discussion, students will learn about the development of different dramatic techniques and forms through the history of theater, about the co-evolving relationship between politically-themed spectacles and changing ideas about citizenship and political legitimacy, and about the political psychology of speeches and campaign techniques.     ERIC S. DICKSON is Associate Professor of Politics and a faculty affiliate in the Department of Psychology. His research interests include political communication, election campaigning, political leadership, and identities in politics. His work, which uses both game theory and social-scientific experiments, focuses on the interface between political strategy and political psychology. He also has an extensive background in theater.      Physics at Accelerators      (FRSEM-UA 477; class # 12933)   Instructor: Henry Stroke   Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00-3:00 p.m.     We will look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These will involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radiofrequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion will be based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion will require an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, will be introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei will lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection will be discussed, as will nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, will be among the numerous detection techniques encountered.     HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radiofrequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \"on-line\" mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible  non-zero neutrino mass.    Heloise: A Woman for the Twelfth Century      (FRSEM-UA 478; class # 12934)   Instructor: Fiona Griffiths   Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30-1:30 p.m.    Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I lecture (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30-10:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      Few medieval women have been so often studied and yet so little understood as Heloise, abbess of the Paraclete (d. 1164). Her life, known primarily through the letters that she exchanged with her former husband, the philosopher Peter Abelard (d. 1142), offers a study in contradiction: she was an educated woman at a time when women were supposedly barred from education; a nun who, though dedicated to God, battled sexual desire; a mother, whose spiritual daughters seemingly displaced her one biological son; and a wife, whose husband became her \u201cbrother\u201d in Christ. Traditional accounts have flattened these rich and various contradictions, presenting Heloise primarily as a tragic heroine. Seduced by her much older teacher, this Heloise conceives and bears a child, seeks a love unfettered by bonds of wedlock, and ultimately accepts enclosure in the monastery as her last desperate act of obedience to her lover, Abelard. This seminar revises the traditional image of Heloise, dignifying her as a scholar, monastic reformer, and administrator\u2014as well as a lover, wife, mother, and friend.      FIONA J. GRIFFITHS, Associate Professor in the Department of History, is a medievalist who focuses on women and gender within the monastic life from late antiquity through the thirteenth century. A Canadian by birth, she earned her PhD from Cambridge University and has received fellowships from the Institute of Historical Research (London), the National Endowment for the Humanities, Harvard University, and the Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung.      Comparative Revisionism in Historical Writing      (FRSEM-UA 482; class # 12935)   Instructor: Joe Lee   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-12:00 p.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      'Revisionist' and 'Revisionism' are two of the most widely used terms in recent historical discourse to describe particular types of historical writing. They are used as terms of praise, criticism, and abuse. This course seeks to explore the modalities of thought of both revisionists and their critics by looking at a number of case-studies in comparative historical perspective, striving to locate them in their particular historical circumstances and conjunctures. Case studies concerning specific controversies relating to British, German, Irish and Israeli historical writing, frequently involving foreign, including American, authorities in these fields, will be analyzed to determine what general conclusions, if any, can be deduced concerning modalities of historical thought.     JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU. He was previously at University College Cork (Ireland), where he chaired the History Department and served for periods as Dean of Arts and as Vice President. He is a former Member of the Upper House of the Irish Parliament and former Member of the British-Irish Parliamentary Body; he also served as the Chair of the Fulbright Commission for Ireland and as President of the Irish Association for European Studies. He is author of seminal histories of Ireland, The Modernization of Irish Society, 1848-1918 and the prize-winning Ireland, 1912-1985: Politics and Society . His op-ed columns for the Sunday Tribune were collected as The Shifting Balance of Power: Exploring the 20th Century , and he recently co-edited Making the Irish American: The History and Heritage of the Irish in the United States with Marion R. Casey.      American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820-2012      (FRSEM-UA 485; class # 12936)   Instructor: Beth Machlan   Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. \u2013 12:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Thursday, 9:30 a.m. - 10:30 a.m.     This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cPanic Room,\u201d and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11.     BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories.

Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts      (FRSEM-UA 490; class # 12937)   Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons   Class meetings: Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Monday, 4:00-5:00 p.m.     This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We will examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students will visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art.     AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and won awards from Yale University and Open City magazine. She has worked as a teaching artist in New York City public schools, and last year co-designed and taught a course at the Solomon R.

She holds a BA from Yale and an  MFA in Fiction Writing from NYU.      The Cultural Work of Play      (FRSEM-UA 491; class # 12938)   Instructor: Louis Bury   Class Meetings: Tuesdays, 3:30-6:00 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 2:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.    Note:conflicts with science examinations (Friday, 2:00-4:00 p.m.)      In his book Homo Ludens , Latin for \"man the player,\" Dutch historian Johan Huizinga defined play as a free and disinterested activity separate from \"real\" or \"ordinary\" life. Yet, free and disinterested as play may appear, the forms it takes and the significance participants and spectators accord to it always carries with them values. In this seminar, we will read across a wide variety of genres and disciplines in order to consider the myriad ways in which people have understood the importance of play and games to culture. As well, we will explore the extent to which work--both academic and otherwise--permits, even encourages, forms of serious play. Possible readings include: articles of the sociology of sport; articles on game theory; treatises on stadium financing and design; novels; memoirs; films; poems; works of ludic, or game-like, literature; works of literary journalism; works of art; works of history; works of anthropology; works of theory/philosophy. In addition to a final research project on the subject of play, students will be expected to compose weekly writing assignments, many of them playful in nature.     LOUIS BURY's first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (forthcoming from Dalkey Archive Press), plays with the conventions of academic writing through the use of arbitrary rules and procedures (such as a chapter written on the subway and a chapter written entirely in questions). He is currently at work on a book of creative non-fiction and cultural criticism entitled The Gym . He is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU and he holds a Ph.D. in English from the CUNY Graduate Center. During graduate school, he supported himself as a part-time professional poker player.      Women in Social Movements in Latin America      (FRSEM-UA 493; class # 12939)   Instructor: Pamela Calla   Thursdays, 2:00-4:30 p.m.   Required Cohort Meeting: Friday, 10:00 a.m. - 11:00 a.m.    Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 1:45 p.m.)      The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women's political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This will allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action in relation to their own notions of political and democratic gains and inclusion and attainment (or not) of economic, cultural, racial and gender justice vis-a-vis the state in each country examined.

The aim was to offer select freshmen, in their very first semester, the opportunity to be in a small, intellectually stimulating class taught by an expert professor. From the start, the program proved to be highly popular with students and instructors alike. The number of seminars has grown from a mere seven in the fall of 1992 to more than sixty in recent fall semesters. The instructors have been drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders.With the launching of the College Cohort Program in fall 2012, every CAS freshman is required to take one of these seminars. Since 2005, the College has extended the principles behind these first-year seminars to the Advanced Honors Seminars program for sophomores, juniors, and (space permitting) seniors. The FRESHMAN HONORS SEMINARS have as their goals to put new students into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through rigorous standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. To that end, they stress demanding readings and writing assignments that introduce students to an essential research skill\u2014such as a literature review, quantitative reasoning, critical use of primary sources, the identification of a research problem, critical analysis of texts, or confrontations with works or art. In addition to participating actively in class discussions, students are expected to give oral presentations in class. A final paper will typically, though not always, have gone through one or more revisions, perhaps revised with the benefit of in-class comments. In other seminars the focus may be on individual or group projects.  Language and Reality in Modern Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210; class # 6771 Instructor: Friedrich Ulfers  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The course explores the possibility that there exists a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \u201cpostmodern\u201d literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and of their implications in literary works revolves around their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Readings include selections from the works of Virginia Woolf, Borges, Kundera, Pirsig, and Pynchon, and from non-technical texts on quantum and chaos theory. FRIEDRICH ULFERS is Associate Professor of German. Winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal, and NYU Alumni Association Great Teacher Award, he has taught not only in the German Department but also in the Draper Interdisciplinary Master\u2019s Program, offering courses on, among others, Nietzsche and Kafka that engage his interdisciplinary interests (literary theory, psychology, philosophy). He has written widely on twentieth-century German authors and is at present preparing a study of Nietzsche as a postmodernist.  The Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218; class # 6772 Instructor: John E. Sexton Tuesday, 6:45\u20138:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? The course divides these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. It focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-century liberal constitutional democracy. Most students consider the workload for this course very heavy; please do not enroll unless you are willing and eager to perform at that level. JOHN E. SEXTON, President of New York University, was the Dean of the NYU Law School from 1988 to 2002. He has taught courses on the Constitution and the courts, and has led seminars on the intersection of religion and the law. Before he came to NYU, he served as law clerk for Chief Justice Warren Burger of the U.S. Supreme Court, and has testified frequently before the U.S. Congress. In addition to his law degree, he holds a doctorate in the history of American religion.  First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235; class # 6773   Instructor: Stephen D. Solomon  syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Prerequisites: A score of 4 or 5 in either AP U.S. History or in AP U.S. Government and Politics (or equivalent international exam); a 4 or 5 on both exams (or equivalent international exams) is strongly recommended. Conflicts over freedom of speech and press erupt into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge indecency from online communications. A judge issues an order shutting down a website that publishes secret documents. Reporters go to jail for refusing to reveal the identity of sources. Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any governmental restrictions of speech and press, the Supreme Court in fact balances free and open expression against other vital interests of society. This course, which involves study of both history and law, begins by examining the robust debate and dissent during the founding period and the struggle during that time against prosecutions for seditious libel (the crime of criticizing the government or public officials). We examine how the Supreme Court gave meaning to the freedom of expression by looking at a rich variety of contemporary conflicts, including libel of public and private persons, prior restraints against publication, flag burning, and restrictions on freedom of speech during wartime. STEPHEN D. SOLOMON is an Associate Professor in NYU\u2019s Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, where he teaches First Amendment freedom of expression. He is working on An American Invention: The Founding Generation and the Struggle for Freedom of Speech , to be published by Macmillan. His book Ellery\u2019s Protest tells the story of the controversial Supreme Court decision in which the justices ruled that state-organized prayer and Bible reading in the public schools violated the First Amendment. Solomon is a recipient of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. He earned a J.D. at Georgetown University Law Center.  School and Society: NYU in the Sixties and Seventies FRSEM-UA 255; class # 6774   Instructor: Arthur Tannenbaum  syllabus Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The 1960s and 1970s brought profound changes in American society, changes mirrored in the history of the nation, academe, and New York University. It was a time that witnessed the struggle for civil rights, assassinations, war abroad and riots at home, and a youth-led revolution in music, dress, and values. This course aims to develop an appreciation of those years by examining the events and the reactions as they affected campuses and students across America. Students will prepare reports on different aspects of the era. In addition, through shared background reading, class members will work on group projects. In both cases, and in the spirit of the times, the topics will be self-chosen with the approval of the group and the seminar leader. ARTHUR TANNENBAUM is Associate Curator and Social Work Librarian in the Bobst Library, and has also taught in the English Department. First as a student and then as a faculty member, he has been at NYU for more than thirty years. In 1992 he received the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Medal in recognition for his work with students.  Spring 2014 The Politics of Knowledge FRSEM-UA 277; class # 14596 Instructor: Thomas Bender  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. N ote: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Knowledge is power, it is said. If that is true, is there a politics of knowledge? In academe, knowledge is often contested. Is knowledge only political? What is the difference between \u201copinion\u201d and \u201cknowledge\u201d? The university is organized around disciplines. What is the role of academic disciplines? How is knowledge validated? Do all disciplines have the same criteria for knowledge? Are there different kinds of knowledge? Are there incommensurable knowledges? Do artists, humanists, and scientists understand knowledge and knowledge claims differently? Are visual, numerical, narrative, and analytical forms of knowing/interpreting all forms of knowledge? What is the relation of interpretation to knowledge? Is all knowledge interpretive? Is some interpretive, and other not? Is there a way to determine that some knowledge claims are truer than others? The seminar proceeds by reading and discussion and weekly \u201cresponses\u201d to readings, critical two-page papers related to some of the readings, and a short research paper. THOMAS BENDER is University Professor of the Humanities and Professor of History. On the faculty since 1974, he has served as chair of the History Department and Dean for the Humanities. His teaching and research interests cover the history of cities, intellectuals and cultural history more generally.

Memoirs and Diaries in Modern European Jewish History FRSEM-UA 312; class # 14334 Instructor: Marion Kaplan  syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.) This course analyzes modern Jewish history through the use of memoirs and diaries, which can offer an abundance of detail about the public political, economic, social and religious worlds and provide valuable, often rare glimpses into the motivations and expectations of Jews regarding the non-Jewish world. Moreover, these ego-documents reveal crucial concealed thoughts and emotions, as well as attitudes and behaviors within the family, friendship networks, and the Jewish community. They allow students to delve into relations between parents and children, spouses, generations, neighbors, and friends. The course begins with a memoir written by a Jewish woman, Glikl of Hameln, in the late 17th century, and continues through the mid-20th century and the Holocaust. It includes the autobiographies of Leon Modena, a 17th-century Venetian rabbi; Solomon Maimon, an 18th-century Jewish philosopher/bohemian/heretic; Pauline Wengeroff, a traditional Jewish woman in 19th-century Russia; and Puah Rakowski, a Polish radical. Students will study a variety of readings from the period of the Holocaust. Students are responsible for reading the primary sources, and the instructor assigns introductory materials to place the memoirs in their historical context in each class. MARION KAPLAN is Skirball Professor of Modern Jewish History. She has also taught at Queens College, CUNY. She is the author of The Jewish Feminist Movement in Germany: The Campaigns of the J\u00fcdischer Frauenbund, 1904\u20131938; The Making of the Jewish Middle Class: Women, Family, and Identity in Imperial Germany; and Between Dignity and Despair: Jewish Life in Nazi Germany; and the co-editor of Gender and Jewish History .

Recycling Music: From Classical to Broadway, Film, and Pop FRSEM-UA 319; class # 18467 Instructor: Rena Mueller  syllabus Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Sixty years ago the musical Kismet opened on Broadway, and the Russian post-Wagnerian symphonist Alexander Borodin, who had been dead for 66 years, was named as the co-recipient of a Broadway Tony Award for the use of his compositions. Two well-known musical-comedy writers had reworked several movements from Borodin\u2019s oeuvre to construct the score, something they had done before (successfully, in The Song of Norway , to the music of Grieg) and would do again (unsuccessfully, in Anya , music by Rachmaninoff). These are among the many instances in which musicians and composers of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have reached back into the past for inspiration, not only for the Broadway stage or the movie screen but also for dance and popular music. We examine representative examples of these borrowings in several media: the Broadway stage ( Rent, Aida ), ballet, film ( Fantasia, Brief Encounter, Elvira Madigan, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon Warner Brothers cartoons), and popular music (Alicia Keys, Eric Carmen, All By Myself, Never Gonna Fall in Love Again , Procol Harum). After a brief introduction to the concept of musical transference and the concept of parody in music (Bach, Mozart), students compare original \u201cclassical\u201d compositions with their subsequent reinterpretations on Broadway or in popular music and film, and examine the culture of changes that went into the transference from the original medium to its later incarnation. Classical composers/conductors and artists who were critical to this movement are also considered.  RENA CHARNIN MUELLER teaches historical musicology at New York University. She is the recipient of the Liszt Medal given by the American Liszt Society for 2011, and edited the Journal of the American Liszt Society from 2001 to 2011.

With M\u00e1ria Eckhardt, she is the author of the Liszt \u201cList of Works\u201d for The New Grove 2001 , and together they are preparing a complete thematic catalogue of Liszt\u2019s music.  Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355; class # 6780 Instructor: John Maynard  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Students in this seminar read a selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from the latter half of the twentieth century to the present. They learn to consider different approaches to literature. They complete the course by preparing a discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis will be placed on learning how to analyze theoretical problems and how to improvise in applying them to new situations. The seminar is recommended for students interested in any area of the humanities. JOHN MAYNARD is Professor of English at NYU. His interests include literary interpretation, readers and reading, literary theory, biography, and Victorian and modern literature. He has published books on a variety of subjects in Victorian literature and is editor of Victorian Literature and Culture . His most recent book is on readers and reading.

The Art and Architecture of Papal Rome: Michelangelo and Caravaggio FRSEM-UA 366; class # 8250 Instructor: Guy Walton  syllabus  Wednesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Recent biographies of Michelangelo by John Spike (Young Michelangelo) and by Antonio Forcellino (Michelangelo a Tormented Life) , and of Caravaggio by Andrew Graham-Dixon (Caravaggio, a Life Sacred and Profane) , will provide the focus of this course along with contemporary writings. The course will study the remarkable papal patronage of the arts of Rome during the reigns of a number of popes, including Sixtus IV, Alexander VI, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Paul III, Sixtus V, Clement VIII and Paul V along with other patrons close to the papal court at the time. GUY WALTON is Professor Emeritus of Art History at the College of Arts and Science. His degrees are from Wesleyan University and NYU\u2019s Institute of Fine Arts (M.A., Ph.D.).

His published works include scholarly articles, reviews, and exhibition catalogs. He is the author of Louis XIV\u2019s Versailles .  The Writer in New York FRSEM-UA 367; class # 8119 Instructor: Vincent Passaro Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. New York was once the undisputed capital of American literary life. Taking on the many images and expressions of the writer in New York over the past century and more, this seminar presents the city as a kind of super-literary event, a vivid aesthetic and social organism that enlarges and tunes the artistic imagination and the writer\u2019s crucial powers of observation. We read primary sources and secondary commentary to examine how a number of writers have negotiated\u2014and how the city has powerfully influenced\u2014the fragile construction of their literary art and their personal identities. An important goal of the course is to reach a nuanced historical understanding of our city, acknowledging its peculiar power to erase its own history as it changes and grows. We attend to the perennial difficulties of money and competition that preoccupies most writers living here, the stress that characterizes both life in New York and the life of the writer, and how those strained lives have helped to create a kind of literary tradition of their own. Through the readings\u2014from Whitman to James, from Crane to Millay to Fitzgerald, from the Beats to the Downtown writers to recent web postings\u2014we will try to understand the New York writer\u2019s particular forms of misery and joy. VINCENT PASSARO is the author of the New York novel Violence, Nudity, Adult Content . His widely anthologized short fiction, essays, criticism and reviews have appeared in GQ, Esquire, Harper\u2019s Magazine, The Nation, the New York Times Magazine , and the London Sunday Times Magazine , among other venues, and he has written online for Salon.com and Mr. Beller\u2019s Neighborhood , a site dedicated to stories from New York.  Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371; class # 6781 Instructor: Carol Sternhell  syllabus  Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Starting college can be exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and drugs. In this class we read a selection of college novels from different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a contemporary Ivy League university). We discuss these novels from a variety of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres, including fiction and nonfiction. Together we will explore this important life passage, examining life as we live it. CAROL STERNHELL, the Department of Journalism\u2019s former Associate Chair, is Associate Professor of Journalism and a director of the Arthur L.

She received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2005. The Doctor\u2019s Dilemma: Being Both Correct and Right FRSEM-UA 379; class # 6782 Instructor: Michael E. Makover  syllabus  Tuesday, 6:20\u20138:50 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Dr. Saul Farber, former Dean of the NYU School of Medicine, frequently cautioned that an action or a conclusion might be correct, but would it be right? Ethics, laws, and religious and cultural beliefs intersect in every medical encounter and healthcare issue and affect patients\u2019 options and care. Determining how to treat patients correctly and safely is difficult, but figuring out what is right is even harder. The challenging issues to be studied and debated in this seminar include the following: Should doctors help terminal patients die to relieve intractable suffering? Should doctors participate in executions or in the interrogation of terrorists? Do we want to know so much about our genetic makeup that we are faced with terribly difficult consequences of that knowledge? Is \u201calternative medicine\u201d a reasonable alternative? What makes a good doctor good? Who should pay for your healthcare? The course aims to teach students how to address such questions by learning to think like doctors and scientists, to apply logic tempered by human values and experience, to analyze information critically, and to present ideas effectively and honestly. Students submit weekly essays on subjects assigned in class and write a long essay at the end of the semester. MICHAEL E.

Computational Thought FRSEM-UA 385; class # 6784 Instructor: Dennis E. Shasha  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30-4:30 p.m. Prerequisites: AP calculus, discrete mathematics, or programming experience Computational technology and methods lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and, regrettably, war. There are very powerful ideas underlying the field that have roots in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture, interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer programs (in the programming language Python). Students make a few presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges. DENNIS SHASHA is Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of New York University where he works with biologists on pattern discovery for network inference; with computational chemists on algorithms for protein design; with physicists and financial specialists on algorithms for time series; on clocked computation for DNA computing; and on computational reproducibility. Other areas of interest include database tuning as well as tree and graph matching. Because he likes to type, he has written six books of puzzles about a mathematical detective named Dr. Ecco, a biography about great computer scientists, and a book about the future of computing. He has also written five technical books about database tuning, biological pattern recognition, time series, DNA computing, statistics, and causal inference in molecular networks. He has co-authored over sixty journal papers, seventy conference papers, and fifteen patents. Professor Shasha has also written the puzzle column for various publications including Scientific American . Suffering and Comfort: Explorations in Narrative Medicine and Other Sources FRSEM-UA 393; class # 6785 Instructor: Michele Shedlin  syllabus  Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The purpose of this seminar is to explore the nature of suffering and comfort, coping and resilience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care needs create complexity in our lives. To explore these issues, we focus on readings in narrative medicine and other sources, including film, newspaper and magazine articles, novels, poetry and religious texts. This guides our discussions on the different ways individuals and cultures view these important dimensions of the human experience. Students become familiar with conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is continually balanced between suffering and comfort. MICHELE SHEDLIN, Professor at the NYU College of Nursing, is a medical anthropologist with extensive experience in reproductive health, substance abuse and HIV/AIDS research in Africa, Latin America and the U.S. She has designed and implemented behavioral studies at the community, university and national levels, to inform and evaluate prevention and care. Dr. Shedlin is currently involved in NIH-funded research on HIV risk for Colombian refugees in Ecuador, medication adherence among US\u2013Mexico border populations, acculturation and HIV risk for sexual minority populations and post-Katrina Latino migrant workers in New Orleans. She maintains adjunct faculty appointments at Columbia University, University of Texas at El Paso and the University of Connecticut. Her publications and reports address HIV risk behavior and care, ethical issues in research and practice, immigrant health, and women\u2019s reproductive decision-making and access to services.  Spring 2014 Word and Image FRSEM-UA 399; class # 7942 Instructor: Mark Podwal  syllabus  Monday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This art history survey explores the interplay between the verbal and visual. The Second Commandment, which some say bans all figurative art, has been interpreted in ways far less literal and more ambiguous. With the invention of the printing press, pictures were characteristically regarded as less important than texts. Nowadays, there is much less distinction between the realms of the verbal and visual. In the 1970s, the Op-Ed page of the New York Times set editorial illustration in a new direction: a symbiosis of word and image. The \u201ciconotext,\u201d a genre in which neither image nor text is free from the other, includes one-panel cartoons, children\u2019s picture books and graphic novels such as Art Spiegleman\u2019s Maus . Words are frequently featured in modern art from the Cubist collages of Picasso to the stenciled letters of Jasper Johns. Although it has been more common for words to inspire images, at times images have inspired words. E. B. White\u2019s poem \u201cI Paint What I See\u201d parodies the controversy over Diego Rivera\u2019s mural in Rockefeller Center. Leonard Shlain in The Alphabet versus the Goddess proposes that literacy reinforced the brain\u2019s predominantly masculine left hemisphere at the expense of the iconic feminine right side. Readings include All the Art That\u2019s Fit to Print (And Some That Wasn\u2019t): Inside The New York Times Op-Ed Page by Jerelle Kraus; The Painted Word by Tom Wolfe; and Leonardo and A Memory of His Childhood by Sigmund Freud. Relevant gallery and museum visits are assigned. MARK PODWAL, Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatology at the NYU School of Medicine, pursues a parallel career as an artist. For thirty-eight years, his drawings appeared on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times . He is the author and illustrator of numerous books, as well as the illustrator of books by Elie Wiesel and Harold Bloom. His art is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Library of Congress. He has received awards from the Society of Illustrators and the Society of Newspaper Design, and the French government named him an Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Moreover, he was the first recipient of the NYU School of Medicine Alumnus Medicine in the Humanities Award. His documentary film House of Life: The Old Jewish Cemetery in Prague was broadcast in 2008 and 2010 on PBS.  America\u2019s Role in International Affairs since World War II FRSEM-UA 405; class # 6786 Instructor: James B. Sitrick  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar explores America\u2019s role in international affairs since World War II, interweaving into the conversation current foreign policy issues that are challenging America. To provide historical perspective, the class first reads George F. Kennan\u2019s classic book American Diplomacy, 1900\u20131950 . Subsequent topics include the creation of the UN during the late 1940s and some of its more recent activities, including possible reform; the activities of the CIA in recent years; the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962; American involvement in Vietnam in the 1960s and early 1970s; America\u2019s long involvement in the Middle East, including its more than sixty-year support for the State of Israel and the alleged influence of the \u201cIsrael Lobby\u201d on U.S. foreign policy; the current U.S. relationship with Iran; how the U.S. may have inflamed the insurgency in Iraq during the first few years of the war; the imperial presidency (comparing Arthur Schlesinger Jr.\u2019s celebrated 1973 book on the subject with the actions of the Bush 43 administration); and the foreign policy challenges of the Obama administration. JAMES B. SITRICK serves as Of Counsel to the international law firm of Baker &amp; McKenzie, which has offices in seventy cities in forty countries. He previously served as Chairman and CEO of Coudert Brothers, the oldest international law firm in America during which time that firm opened the first private law office in the then Soviet Union, in Moscow, in addition to offices in Sydney, Shanghai, Bangkok, Jakarta, Los Angeles, and San Jose. His government and NGO service includes extensive work for the Department of the Treasury in drafting international legislation and negotiating treaties with foreign countries. He has also served as Secretary General of the World Federation of United Nations Associations. In addition, he serves as a Trustee of many American and European cultural institutions, as well as on the Arts and Science Board of Overseers at NYU. Is Karl Marx Still Relevant? FRSEM-UA 413; class # 14944 Instructor: Jeff Goodwin  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. There was a time not so long ago when a critical engagement with the writings of Karl Marx was considered an obligatory intellectual and political rite of passage. No serious intellectual or political activist could not read Marx\u2014whether one ultimately accepted or rejected Marx\u2019s ideas, in whole or in part. Is this still true? Are Marx\u2019s ideas, or some of them, still relevant? Which of his ideas remain important or valuable for people who wish to understand\u2014and perhaps to change\u2014the contemporary world? Which of Marx\u2019s ideas are problematic or pass\u00e9? To address these questions, students in this course critically examine some of Marx\u2019s most important writings, including The Communist Manifesto, The German Ideology, The Civil War in France , and\u2014above all\u2014 Capital , Marx\u2019s magnum opus. In assessing the contemporary relevance of Marx\u2019s ideas, we also read several efforts by Marx\u2019s followers to understand a range of important phenomena, including the nature of the state, current U.S. politics, and the ongoing economic crisis. JEFF GOODWIN is Professor of Sociology. His has written extensively about social movements, revolutions, and terrorism. His books include The Social Movements Reader, Contention in Context, Passionate Politics, and No Other Way Out: States and Revolutionary Movements, 1945\u20131991 . He is currently writing a book about why states and rebels sometimes employ terrorism as a strategy. He is a winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Branding: People, Places, Things FRSEM-UA 422; class # 6787 Instructor: Richard L. Lewis  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Brands are red hot and understanding branding is, too. Just what is it and why do people now want to possess personal brands? And what exactly is a brand, say, versus a product? Brands can be magical, prosaic, living or dead. And while companies manicure them it\u2019s up to us, the audience, to determine if they are successful. Brands can be great time-savers: it\u2019s reassuring a visit to McDonald\u2019s is pretty much the same all around the world. Brands help us avoid making the same decisions over and over by building bridges of trust. They provide information, advice, smiles, and community. They live, breathe, grow, and sometimes (deservedly) die. Brands use a variety of rational and emotional tools to connect with us. Even the brand owners sometimes don\u2019t really know what the glue is that cements the relationships with their audiences. This course analyzes what makes brands tick: how they\u2019re created, the ingredients, the evolution\u2014how time, technology, distribution, competitors, and consumers force them to change. We examine how branding has impacted politics and presidents. We also examine the dark side of brands\u2019 magnetism. The course will also examine our budding, personal brands because through our reputations\u2014or brands\u2014our family, friends, enemies, teachers and bosses evaluate us. How are we perceived? How do we create, change, and live up to our own brands? Branding is a course that provides insight into our everyday lives. Consider it a marketing course for the rest of us. RICHARD L. LEWIS is an independent marketing consultant who solves business, branding, and strategic problems for companies, professionals, and individuals. He was the longtime worldwide managing director at TBWA/Chiat/ Day, leading the ABSOLUT Vodka account, responsible for marketing, strategy, and creative. He has written two bestselling books about advertising, and has also taught at Yale College.  The Science and Policy of Climate Change FRSEM-UA 432; class # 15018 Instructor: Edwin Gerber  syllabus  Tuesday and Thursday, 3:30\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Hurricane Sandy. The Keystone XL pipeline. Fracking. The topic of climate change continues to inject itself into headlines, despite the reluctance of Washington to have a genuine conversation on the topic. Climate change provokes heated argument not only because of the great environmental, economic, and political implications, but also how it injects itself into our daily lives on such a personal level, impacted each time we flip a switch, decide what's for dinner, or connect on Facebook. Each Google search adds roughly 0.2 grams of carbon to the atmosphere; a harmless sounding number, except for the fact that collectively the world makes about 5 billion searches each day ... and that number is growing fast! To help you make informed decisions about climate change, this course explores the science of global warming. We investigate the evidence from observations and the physical and mathematical foundations upon which forecasts of future climate are based. What are the key uncertainties in the predictions, and what steps are required to reduce them? Armed with this scientific basis, you then conduct your own research project on the economic and policy side of climate change, giving you a chance to enter the debate, and perhaps contribute to the solution! EDWIN GERBER is a Professor of Atmosphere-Ocean Science at NYU\u2019s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. His research focuses on the natural variability of the Earth's atmosphere (for example, why are some winters so cold and snowy compared to others?) and the role it plays in the response of the climate system to anthropogenic (human) forcing. More recently he has investigated how the formation of the ozone hole changed the circulation of the Southern Hemisphere, with possible implications for the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets and global sea level rise. Trials of the Century FRSEM-UA 434; class # 6789 Instructor: Jack Ford  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. How does a trial become viewed as a \u201ctrial of the century\u201d? What does that designation say about the crime and the personalities involved, about the legal, social, and political implications of the case, and about the nature and extent of the attendant media coverage? Since the trial of Socrates, the public has been intrigued, galvanized, and even entertained by the real drama of real trials. These trials have provided a prism through which society\u2019s strengths and weaknesses are often revealed. This course will offer in-depth examinations of select \u201ctrials of the century.\u201d Some, such as the Lindbergh kidnapping case and the O.J. Simpson trial, will focus on the impact of celebrity on the justice system. Others, such as the trials of the Scottsboro Boys, will examine the effect of race inside the courtroom. Political issues often find voice in the justice system, as in the case of the Chicago Seven. And religion, that great uniting and dividing force, played a critical role in the Scopes Monkey Trial. Such trials have historically held a mirror up to society and have provided an instructive reflection of what transpires within our courts of law. JACK FORD is an Emmy and Peabody Award-winning journalist, author, and a nationally recognized trial attorney who has taught at Yale University and Fordham Law School. Currently a CBS News Legal Analyst, Mr. Ford most recently served as the Anchor of Jack Ford: Courtside on COURT TV, which he helped launch in 1991. He has also served as Chief Legal Correspondent on NBC News and as an Anchor/ Correspondent for ABC News. As a trial attorney, he successfully handled a number of high-profile cases, such as the Northeast\u2019s first death-penalty trial, one of the nation\u2019s first corporate homicide cases, and the Wall Street insider-trading scandal of the late 1980s, and authored a number of articles for respected legal publications. He is the recipient of five honorary degrees in recognition of his professional accomplishments and his extensive public service work.  History, Memory, and the Quest for Social Justice in the U.S. FRSEM-UA 437; class # 6790 Instructor: Jack Salzman  syllabus  Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) This course explores the relationship between history and memory, between what we know and how we know what we think we know. One of its primary objectives is to address the ethics of memory. Do we remember events not as they are but as we are? Do we have an obligation to remember events from the past? If we do, which events must we remember, and how do we remember those we did not experience? Or, as Marc Auge argues, is it essential for the health of the individual and of society that we know how to forget? We begin by looking at three major aspects of life in the United States in the early 1940s: the response to the Holocaust, the establishment of internment camps for Japanese Americans, and the impact of Jim Crow laws. We then consider such events as the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, Brown v. Board of Education , McCarthy and the blacklist, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, the destruction of the World Trade Center, and the response to genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. To understand better the lives of those people most affected by acts of injustice, we will read works by such writers as Baldwin, Roth, and Salinger. We will also consider the role that museums, photography, film, and popular culture have in defining our individual and collective memory. JACK SALZMAN has been the recipient of a Distinguished Teaching award and two Fulbright Professorships. He formerly served as the Director of the Center for American Culture Studies at Columbia University, and for thirty years was the editor of Prospects: An Annual of American Cultural Studies . He is the Editor-in-Chief of the five-volume Encyclopedia of African American Culture and History . Much of his work has been devoted to the relationship between African Americans and American Jews, including Struggles in the Promised Land (with Cornel West) and Bridges and Boundaries , the catalog for an exhibit at the Jewish Museum in New York. He recently completed We Remember the Children , a collection of thirty-five memoirs by Holocaust survivors, and currently is working on a book focusing on the impact the Holocaust had on Jews and social justice in the United States.  Virtue/Success/Happiness: Business in U.S. Literature FRSEM-UA 440; class # 6791 Instructor: Saul Rosenberg  syllabus  Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Through the study of stories, novels, non-fiction, and film from 1776 to the present, we study the evolution of attitudes among some of the most engaging American writers to the central ideas of business. What is the relationship between virtue, material success, and happiness? How did the idea of \u201cdoing well by doing good\u201d fare as the Republic developed? We examine what writers such as Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, and James thought about the American business of \u201cgetting and spending,\u201d and how Stowe and Twain reacted to the moral collapse inherent in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of slavery. We observe how our theme fared with the emergence in the later nineteenth century of the \u201crobber barons\u201d of the Gilded Age, the rise of the corporation at the end of the century, and the enormous influx of immigration into American cities that fed the growth of capitalism shortly afterwards. In the twentieth century, what do films like Greed and Wall Street and novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Fountainhead tell us about how the connections between virtue, success, and happiness have developed? The course finishes with reflections on what conclusions we can draw from the recent financial crisis for our theme. SAUL ROSENBERG, who holds a Ph.D. in American Literature from Columbia and degrees from Berkeley and Cambridge, has taught American literature at Columbia University and the 92nd Street Y, and served as associate editor of Commentary magazine. He has also been a consultant at McKinsey and Company, the leading management consulting firm, where he now manages publishing and knowledge management programs. He writes regularly on books for the Wall Street Journal . Truth and Sedition from Galileo to the Present FRSEM-UA 442; class # 8752 Instructor: William Klein  syllabus  Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The truth can set you free, but of course it can also get you into trouble. How do the constraints on the pursuit and expression of truth change with the nature of the censoring regime, from the family to the church to the modern nation-state and beyond? What causes regimes to protect perceived vulnerabilities in the systems of knowledge they privilege? What happens when conflict between regimes themselves implicates modes of knowing (as in the case of Galileo)? Are there types of truth that any regime would\u2014or should\u2014find dangerous? What are the possible motives for self-censorship? Beginning with the persecution of Galileo for his attack on Aristotelian doctrine, and ending with various contemporary cases of censorship within and between regimes (from textbooks to cartoons to search engines), we will consider these questions in relation to select philosophic and literary analyses of the relations between truth and power, including Hobbes, Brecht, Leo Strauss, Foucault, Negri and Zizek. WILLIAM KLEIN studied the history of political theory under J.G.A. Pocock at Johns Hopkins and, as a Fulbright Scholar, under Quentin Skinner at Cambridge. He specializes in legal and political theory, and has served on the editorial review board of the Journal of the History of Philosophy . At NYU, he teaches the history of ideas in Liberal Studies, and has taught in the Freshman Honors Seminar program since 2003. He is currently writing a study of the history and theory of sedition and has also published works of fiction and art criticism. Wiseguys, Spies, and Private Eyes: Heroes and Villains in American Culture, Film, and Literature FRSEM-UA 449; class # 8253 Instructor: Eddy Friedfeld  syllabus  Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Through thematic analyses of books and films by topic and genre, this seminar explores the ways in which specific American archetypes and themes are perceived and articulated\u2014from the rugged Old West individualist, to the persevering underdog who becomes a boxing champ, to the evolving perceptions of government, to the Cold War\u2013era uncertainty that spawned a generation of literary and celluloid superspies. We will examine representations of heroes and villains in modern American popular culture and how great films and novels of three particular genres, the Detective, the Gangster, and the Spy, influenced our understanding of these archetypes. From the early influences of Hamlet and Macbeth to Sherlock Holmes, Raymond Chandler\u2019s Philip Marlowe, Mario Puzo\u2019s (and Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s) The Godfather , James Bond, and Batman, we will look at the mythology and evolution of heroes and villains through popular and high culture icons, the genesis of the genres and how they developed over time, and how great directors, actors, and writers influenced audiences worldwide and were themselves influenced by culture and history. EDDY FRIEDFELD is a film and entertainment journalist and historian who also teaches at Yale College. He is the co-author of Caesar\u2019s Hours with comedy legend Sid Caesar, and is working on a book on the history of comedy in America.

Cities, states and municipalities serve as what Justice Brandeis called \u201clittle laboratories for democracy\u201d\u2014where ideas flourish and problems get solved. From fighting crime in the streets of New York City, to banning smoking in bars and restaurants, to making the power grid more efficient, to encouraging the arts and culture in urban environments, innovations in American cities have spread across the globe. This course examines the intersection of ideas, politics, and action. We study best practices from around the country (and the world), evaluate their effectiveness, and determine whether and how successful programs can be replicated. This course asks students to not only think critically issues of public policy but also to think anew about the role they play in shaping it. Topics for student projects are drawn from current issues and problems facing decision-makers and elected officials in America today. ERIC GIOIA is an attorney with extensive experience in business, law, and government. He joined J.P. Morgan in January 2010 after serving for eight years on the New York City Council.

Spring 2014 Drama Criticism: In History and Practice FRSEM-UA 459, class # 7943 Instructor: Ethan Youngerman Thursday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The history of theater criticism begins with an obscure newspaperman named Aristotle. Ever since, writers have struggled to capture performance on the page. This craft requires, among other things, a basic knowledge of all aspects of theater\u2014after all, how else can we assess something as complex and collaborative as a play\u2019s production? Put another way: how do we know the difference between an amazing actor and an amazingly written part (or between a bad actor and a good actor laboring under horrible direction)? Readings to help us grapple with these questions include many of the great modern theater reviewers (Richard Gilman, Stark Young, Frank Rich, Stanley Kauffmann, Eric Bentley, George Jean Nathan), as well as reviews written by playwrights and poets (everyone from George Bernard Shaw and David Mamet to Dorothy Parker). We also read and workshop the reviews of New York\u2019s newest theater critics: you. Students review four current New York theater productions, as well as write a critical research essay. In this way, we study the history of theater reviews so that we can get better at writing them ourselves, and we write them ourselves so that we can better understand their history. ETHAN YOUNGERMAN is a Senior Language Lecturer and Director of Writing The Essay in Goddard Residential College; he has won departmental awards for Excellence in Teaching every year since he joined the Expository Writing Program over a decade ago. He and his wife Rebecca were recently appointed Faculty Fellows in Residence. Ethan is also a playwright and his plays have been workshopped or produced at numerous theaters, including the Manhattan Theatre Club, The Living Theater, and The Hangar Theatre. His play The Sublet Experiment ran for over six months in actual New York City apartments, receiving positive dramatic criticism from the New York Times , the Associated Press, New York magazine, and many other publications. He received his M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing from NYU. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber FRSEM-UA 461; class # 8167 Instructor: Jing Wang  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:10 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the eighteenth century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China at its dramatic center, the novel intimately explores questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility and the excesses and decadence of the privileged, as well as growing, if hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure and intricate plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. No knowledge of Chinese culture, language, or history is required or assumed. Native Chinese speakers who wish to read and enjoy this masterpiece in the original are advised to choose another Freshman Honors Seminar and take reading the Dream of the Red Chamber (EAST-UA 228) as an elective course in the future. The readings and discussion for EAST-UA 228 are in Chinese, making this course more suitable for native speakers. Consult the CAS Bulletin for prerequisites. JING WANG is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was Lecturer in Chinese.

Oral History of Irish America FRSEM-UA 462; class # 8170 Instructor: Linda Dowling Almeida  syllabus  Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Long before the technology of today's social media, cultures, families and individuals shared their personal and community stories in an oral tradition that preserved the past for future generations. We will examine the discipline and evolution of oral history using the Glucksman Ireland House Oral History of Irish America Collection to explore how aural memory contributes to the historical record and shapes the identity of individuals and communities. This seminar is a unique experience that offers freshmen an interdisciplinary approach to methodology of oral history, its significance as a resource, its role in historical research, as well as specific interviewing and research techniques. Students will gain access to our Archive of Irish America and have the opportunity to work with the interviews we have already deposited, including how the university\u2019s digital mapping technology can be applied in our analysis of the archive. Students will also have the chance to conduct an interview themselves..The course comprises classroom lectures, readings, and extensive writing exercises;. it offers real world experience and communications skills acquisition that will be invaluable throughout students\u2019 academic and professional careers. LINDA DOWLING ALMEIDA, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Irish Studies at NYU\u2019s Glucksman Ireland House, teaches classes in the history and literature of Irish America. Specializing in twentieth-century immigration, Professor Almeida has focused primarily on the \u201cNew Irish\u201d of the 1980s and 90s, publishing chapters in The Irish World Wide (1992), Ireland in the 1950s (2004), and Making the Irish American (2006). Her book Irish Immigrants in New York City, 1945-1995 (2001) compared those who arrived in the 1950s with their counterparts thirty and forty years later. She has delivered papers on pedagogical approaches to oral history to both the Oral History Association and the International Oral History Association. Her latest project involves the production of podcasts on a variety of themes and issues drawn from the archives. Political Cinema and Representation of the \u201cOther\u201d FRSEM-UA 463; class # 8365 Instructor: Shimon Dotan  syllabus  Friday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) In contemporary war, \u201cthe other\u201d is viewed not only as an enemy to be fought but often, as one to be eliminated. How do filmmakers fight against (or alternately, reinforce) such deadly representations? In exploring various cinematic and thematic elements we will primarily focus on films from one of the world\u2019s most conflict-ridden regions\u2014the Middle East. We will also explore films from Russia, Germany, France and the US. Through readings and film screenings, we will investigate how \u201cthe other\u201d is constructed: politically, aesthetically and ethically. This class is designed for anyone interested in filmmaking and film criticism, contemporary politics and history, cinema of conflict and violence, and the ethical questions associated with them. SHIMON DOTAN, a Fellow of the New York Institute of the Humanities at NYU, is an award-winning filmmaker with thirteen feature films to his credit. His films have been the recipients of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin Film Festival ( The Smile of the Lamb ), numerous Israeli Academy Awards, including Best Film and Best Director ( Repeat Dive; The Smile of the Lamb ), and Best Film at the Newport Beach Film Festival ( You Can Thank Me Later ). His film Hot House won the Special Jury Prize at Sundance in 2007. He has taught filmmaking and film studies at Tel Aviv University in Israel and at Concordia University in Montreal and is a member of the Directors and Writers Guilds of America (DGA, WGA). Dostoyevsky: Modernity and the Novel FRSEM-UA 466; class # 8370 Instructor: Ilya Kliger  syllabus  Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. In this course we examine Fyodor Dostoevsky\u2019s fiction as a particularly helpful prism for understanding the conditions, experience, and philosophical ramifications of modernity. The novel is often understood as the genre best capable of representing and reckoning with the complexities of modern life. This is, in fact, how Dostoevsky himself understood his mission as a novelist. Following his cue, then, we try to understand what it is about his writing that is specifically modern. Readings of Dostoevsky\u2019s novels, early as well as late, are supplemented by a number of canonical statements about the modern. Readings from Dostoevsky will include Poor People, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot and The Brothers Karamazov . Supplementary readings from the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Mikhail Bakhtin and others. ILYA KLIGER is Assistant Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies at NYU. His primary interests include the nineteenth-century novel in Russia and France as well as literary and critical theory. His first book explored parallel developments in notions of temporality in nineteenth-century novelistic and philosophical works. His more recent projects have involved exploring tragic patterns in the tradition of the Russian novel.  What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474; class # 8401 Instructor: Trace Jordan  syllabus   Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become a more open minded person? To gain specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a more successful and financially rewarding career after graduation? To have a fun social life and make new friends? To become an engaged participant in a democratic society? To satisfy your parents\u2019 plans for your future? Or perhaps some combination of these reasons that you are still figuring out? This seminar examines historical and contemporary discussions about the personal and societal goals of higher education. It also prompts you to be more reflective and purposeful about your own academic choices during your time as an NYU student. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. During the semester we study issues that have the potential to profoundly transform the college experience. Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? Will new technologies change how professors teach and how students learn? Finally\u2014 and most importantly\u2014how can students, professors, and administrators all contribute to creating a successful college environment? TRACE JORDAN is Clinical Associate Professor and Associate Director of the College Core Curriculum, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. His research interests and publications include the role of science education in a liberal arts curriculum, the use of computer simulations for teaching and learning chemistry, and the impact of interest and motivation on educational engagement and achievement. Professor Jordan is a two-time winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence.  Physics at Accelerators FRSEM-UA 477; class # 16309 Instructor: Henry Stroke  syllabus  Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We look at the nucleus of the atom with quite unusual magnifiers. These involve interactions of atomic electrons with nuclei studied by laser spectroscopy, radio frequencies, or nuclear decays. The microscopy is refined to get smaller and smaller details with the use of particle beam accelerators. These rely on scattering experiments allowing the highest resolution to be achieved. Much of the discussion is based on work done at the European Center for Particle Research (CERN), a forefront facility for these investigations. The discussion requires an introduction to the theory of relativity, mechanics of collisions, particle physics, and antimatter. Basic electricity and magnetism, necessary for discussing both the fundamental interactions and the instrumentation, are introduced. Decays of radioactive nuclei lead into detection techniques for alpha and beta particles and gamma rays. Dosimetry and radiation protection are discussed, as well as nuclear weapons and disasters, and nuclear power generation. Instrumentation, e.g. Geiger counters, scintillation crystals, photomultipliers, wire chambers, coincidence circuits, multichannel devices, are among the numerous detection techniques encountered. HENRY STROKE, Professor of Physics, has spent a major part of his research effort at NYU, MIT, Princeton, and CERN studying electric and magnetic properties of nuclei through their interaction with atomic electrons. The experimental techniques ranged from optics and radio frequency to more recent laser spectroscopy. A major facility in this work has been CERN-ISOLDE, an \u201con-line\u201d mass separator which allows studies of species that have half-lives as low as a few milliseconds. ISOLDE relies on its isotope production on the beginning chain of accelerators that ends with the 27-km long LHC (Large Hadron Collider) ring. His work also brought him to look, with low-temperature techniques, for a possible non-zero neutrino mass.  Gender, Sexuality and the Law FRSEM-UA 480; class # 8766 Instructor: Shelley Fischel  syllabus  Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. What impact has law had on gender and sexuality inequalities? What impact could or should law have? We will explore gender and sexuality discrimination in American jurisprudence as it has developed under the Constitution as well as its consequences in spheres of work, politics, and social life. In the family, the impact of sex/gender law is felt in marriage, divorce and, for example, family planning. In the workplace, the Civil Rights Act and its progeny have broadened opportunities for women, but not unequivocally. Similarly, Title IX has contained discriminatory practices in education, but courts have checked its substantive reach. Criminal law, as is well known, treats crimes associated with sexuality, rape, domestic abuse, prostitution, in unique and perhaps troubling ways. Finally, in all these spheres, gender identity and sexual orientation have a complicated relationship to sex. For purposes of law, is discrimination against LGBT subjects best understood as analytically or socially distinct from sex-based discrimination? What\u2019s the relationship between sex stereotyping and homophobia? This course offers a history of U.S. sex law and analyzes contemporary doctrinal, judicial and legislative developments. SHELLEY D. FISCHEL, ESQ., served as Executive Vice President of Home Box Office, Inc., responsible for Human Resources, Facilities and Real Estate, as well as labor law matters until her retirement in December 2009. She oversaw all sexual discrimination claims in the company. She received her J.D. from Columbia University and her L.L.M. from NYU.            Spring 2014 Global Citizenship: Theory and Practice FRSEM-UA 484; class # 14990 Instructor: Ulrich Baer Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The seminar explores the notion and practice of global citizenship\u2014the capacity and willingness to think across and beyond actual and imagined boundaries, and to develop skills that can solve problems and explore opportunities in unfamiliar contexts. The course examines globalization as a historical, economic, and cultural phenomenon. Other topics include local resistance to global homogeneity; the notion of universal humanism; human rights; the role of language in global contexts; the idea of citizenship; the specificity of culture and arts; the idea of film or photography as universal languages; and an exploration of New York City as an international city that has turned its diversity into strength. The seminar brings in guest speakers who identify as global citizens, and ask how your own actions\u2014ranging from activism to business leadership\u2014may affect change that impacts those outside of your immediate world. Who is a truly global citizen: Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, or Hillary Clinton? How would we assess their reach? And how do you decenter your perspective and see the world from another point of view? ULRICH BAER, Vice Provost of Arts, Humanities and Multicultural Affairs and Professor of Comparative Literature and German, was awarded the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Excellence in Teaching in 1998 and 2004. He is the author of Remnants of Song: Trauma and the Experience of Modernity in Charles Baudelaire and Paul Celan and Spectral Evidence: The Photography of Trauma , editor of the literary anthology 110 Stories: New York Writes after September 11 , and editor and translator of The Poet\u2019s Guide to Life: The Wisdom of Rainer Maria Rilke . He has published widely on photography and co-taught a seminar entitled \u201cArchive, Image, Text\u201d with Professor Shelley Rice, cross-listed in four NYU departments and two schools.  Spring 2014 American Gothics: Hauntings in Fiction, Film and Culture from 1820\u20132012 FRSEM-UA 485; class # 7948 Instructor: Beth Machlan  syllabus  Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This course will explore the roots of the complex aesthetic category known as \u201cThe Gothic,\u201d particularly the ways in which Gothic narratives, from \u201cThe Legend of Sleepy Hollow\u201d to Buffy the Vampire Slayer , have provided uncannily apt representations of American experience from the colonial era to the present. We will think about why the Gothic genre, which traveled with colonists and immigrants from Western Europe, has persisted in American art as a way of depicting and working through peculiarly American tensions about race, class, mobility, and desire, raising the question of how a \u201cnew\u201d nation could become so haunted, so quickly. Armed with excerpts from three hundred years of criticism and theory, we will try to locate the source of the specters in novels by Mark Twain, Ann Petry, and Steven King, films like Rosemary\u2019s Baby and Panic Room , and other social and political spectacles such as the O.J. Simpson trial and the aftermath of 9/11. BETH BOYLE MACHLAN is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. She has received numerous awards for excellence in teaching from both NYU and Princeton University, where she received her Ph.D. in 2004 with a dissertation on ghost stories. Her academic work has appeared in Studies in the Novel , Representing Segregation , and the Los Angeles Review of Books , and her essays have been featured on The Awl, The Hairpin , and The Rumpus .  Propaganda Portraits: Royal Imagery in the Age of Absolutism FRSEM-UA 488; class # 8852 Instructor: William Ambler  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course studies the relationship between art and politics in European baroque state portraiture. In the seventeenth century, with few means to reach a broad populace, depictions of the king played a central part in convincing the people of a monarch\u2019s legitimate authority. The most talented artists of the age glorified their kings in paint, harnessing religious and Roman mythological symbolism to give visual form to political theories that justified increasingly centralized royal rule. To understand these portraits in their original context, the modern viewer must become familiar with the debates that preoccupied seventeenth century European courts: religious controversies of the Reformation; dynastic ambitions of European royal houses; and political theories of legitimate government. Understanding an artist\u2019s position at a royal court and knowledge of the pre-existing traditions of royal imagery is also essential. WILLIAM AMBLER is an independent art historian with expertise in Spanish baroque art and eighteenth-century English architecture. He has been a curator at the Hispanic Society of America in New York City and has participated in exhibitions there, as well as at the Metropolitan Museum, Jewish Museum, and Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.  Haiti Today: Culture, Politics, and Crisis FRSEM-UA 489; class # 8853 Instructor: Katherine Smith   syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.) This course takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding the historical, political, and cultural forces that shape life in Haiti today. Our readings will place Haitian economic development, environment, religion, and culture in a global context. We will focus primarily on the period from the fall of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 to the present. The struggle to realize a system of democratic governance has characterized this period of Haitian history. More recently, Haiti has faced the challenges of rebuilding the material and social infrastructure destroyed by the earthquake of 2010. This has been an unprecedented period of crisis for a nation whose past has always been difficult. In this course we will give particularly close attention to how Haitians understand their world today as conveyed through artistic, literary, historical, and anthropological lenses. KATHERINE SMITH focuses her research on religious frameworks for understanding displacement, death, and regeneration in the Caribbean. She has studied urban Vodou and contemporary Haitian art for more than ten years. Through extensive ethnographic research, her dissertation examined historical transformations of the trickster spirit Gede in visual and embodied cultures of Vodou. She is presently revising that work for publication as a book. Professor Smith spent two years at Brown University as a Mellon-Cogut Postdoctoral Fellow in Africana Studies and History of Art and Architecture. While at Brown, she co-curated a major exhibition on Haitian art titled Reframing Haiti: Art, History, and Performativity . An edited volume based on that exhibition will be published in 2013. She is also on the curatorial team for an exhibition titled I n Extremis: Meditations on Death and Rebirth in 21st Century Haitian Art , which opened in September 2012 at the UCLA Fowler Museum.  Spring 2014 Synesthesia: Intersections of the Visual and Literary Arts FRSEM-UA 490; class # 7949 Instructor: Amy Bonnaffons  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This course will ask students to engage in both creative and academic writing as they explore the intersections of the visual and literary arts. How have notable writers been influenced and inspired by visual art? How have artists and writers attempted to \u201ctranslate\u201d one art form into the other? What do the literary and visual creative processes have in common, and what can each teach us about the other? We examine these questions through academic study and creative practice. Students visit NYC museums and galleries (the Guggenheim, MoMA, Brooklyn Museum, etc); read work by Kurt Vonnegut, Allen Ginsberg, Frank O\u2019Hara, Anne Sexton, and more; and write poetry, fiction, and essays inspired by visual art. In fall 2013 the class blogged some of its creative writing exercises at http://nyusynesthesia.tumblr.com AMY BONNAFFONS is a language lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. Her writing has appeared in the Wall Street Journal , the New York Daily News, Kenyon Review, Anderbo , and elsewhere, and has won awards from Yale University and Open City Magazine .

Guggenheim Museum titled \u201cResponding to Art Through Creative Writing.\u201d She is a past recipient of NYU\u2019s Graduate Teaching Award for her Introduction to Fiction and Poetry class. She holds a B.A. from Yale and an M.F.A. in Fiction Writing from NYU.  Spring 2014 Women in Social Movements in Latin America FRSEM-UA 493; class # 7951 Instructor: Pamela Calla  syllabus Thursday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The overarching theme of this seminar is the exploration of women\u2019s political agency in terms of emancipatory thought and action in diverse social movements throughout Latin America. We will locate this agency and characterize the thought and actions of women within social movements in various national contexts but we will also look at the rising transnationalism of the movements under scrutiny. More concretely, we will focus on indigenous and other popular sectors as well as middle class movements concentrating on the ways in which women brought new meanings and vitality to diverse forms of struggle in these movements. A central consideration in this exploration is the historical relation between movements and states and the gendered logics that enter in the negotiations between the two. This allow us to weave women\u2019s individual and collective thought and action, based on their own notion of what constitutes political and democratic gain, and the inclusion and attainment (or not), of economic, cultural, racial, and gender justice. PAMELA CALLA, an anthropologist, is a Visiting Associate Professor at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at NYU and director of the Observatory on Racism of the Universidad de la Cordillera in La Paz, Bolivia. Currently she also co-coordinates the \u201cNetwork of Observatories on Racism in the Americas,\u201d an initiative launched by the Universidad de la Cordillera and the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, University of Texas. She is the author of works on race, racism, gender, sexism, ethnicity, interculturality and state formation in Bolivia and coeditor of Antropolog\u00eda del Estado: Dominaci\u00f3n y pr\u00e1cticas contestatarias en America Latina . She was an associate researcher for the United Nations-sponsored 2007 report \u201cThe State of the State in Bolivia,\u201d and co-editor of and contributor to Observando el racismo: Racismo y regionalismo en el proceso constituyente boliviano.  The Political Economy of Sports FRSEM-UA 494; class # 14769 Instructor: Neal Beck  syllabus  Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Political economy is a method that can be used to study many areas of human behavior (e.g. Becker on the family, Stigler on regulation, Fogel on history). Sports makes an excellent case study for many of the most important ideas and methods of political economy since it is more easily accessible and has better data than many other potential applications. Each topic is chosen to illustrate an important issue in political economy, and each class meeting features pointers to more traditional political economy applications. In order to cover a wide range of topics, we define political economy quite broadly. In light of NYU's global interests and presence, many applications are drawn from what is known as soccer in the United States. NATHANIEL BECK is Professor of Politics. He specializes in quantitative applications, both in public policy and political science, and issues of research design. He has been at NYU since 2003. At the undergraduate level, he teaches courses in quantitative approaches to public policy and the Senior Honors Seminar. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a winner of the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for Political Methodology, and the founding editor of Political Analysis. Barack Obama, the Man and the President: The Quest for Identity and Purpose FRSEM-UA 495; class # 14940 Instructor: Jeffrey Sammons  syllabus Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. This course explores the life and career path of the nation\u2019s first \u201cblack\u201d president through a focus on his two autobiographies. The course also pays close attention to representations by others of Obama, including critics, supporters, and \u201cneutral\u201d commentators through a variety of media from books to film to television and radio to the blogosphere. As important as Obama is for his unprecedented political achievements, his multiracial, multicultural, multinational, and multi-religious background and experience make him an ideal subject for exploring personal and group identity in a time of apparently increasing concern with Otherness. Our goal is to reconcile vastly divergent representations of one person and not uncritically accept what we are led to believe by him or others. Through this process we not only learn about an extraordinary individual and the power he wields and path he shapes, but also about the writing and making of history and who we are\u2014as well as what we think, believe, and practice. JEFFREY T. SAMMONS is a Professor of History at New York University and specializes in African American, urban, military, sports, and film history. Sammons earned a Ph.D. in American History from the University of North Carolina in 1982. In 1983-84 he was a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Cape Town. After his return from South Africa, Sammons became involved in the anti-apartheid movement and played an important role in the City of Houston\u2019s divestment campaign. Sammons is currently a National Senator of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Sammons is the author of Beyond the Ring: The Role of Boxing in American Society and has written widely on the subject of sport and race. In 2001 Sammons was awarded a fellowship by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture and History and soon after received a National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship for 2002-2003 in support of his soon to be published Never Retreat on the 15th NYNG/369th Regiment and the black soldier\u2019s quest for citizenship in the World War I era. The Cultural Nature of Language FRSEM-UA 496; class # 7284 Instructor: Bambi Schieffelin  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. From accents, pronouns, swearing, and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. In this seminar we examine language-using as a social practice, and analyze how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t (e.g., feral children), we examine speech and silence across a range of societies. We look at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \u201cEnglish Only\u201d), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and authority. BAMBI SCHIEFFELIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Anthropology, is a linguistic anthropologist who has studied speech practices among Haitians (Queens, N.Y.), lawyers and litigants in lower Manhattan\u2019s Small Claims Court, college students and their use of IM, and Bosavi people (Papua New Guinea). She is the author of The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children . She is coeditor of, among other books, The Acquisition of Literacy: Ethnographic Perspectives, Language Ideologies: Practice and Theory and Consequences of Contact . She has also published articles in preeminent journals of her field, including Current Anthropology and Annual Review of Anthropology . She is completing a book on the impact of Christianity on the language and social life of Bosavi people over the past 25 years, and continues research on linguistic creativity and change as evidenced in computer-mediated communication. Professor Schieffelin also received the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence in 2010 and a Distinguished Teaching Award in 2012. How We See FRSEM-UA 497; class # 7289 Instructor: Marisa Carrasco   syllabus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 11 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Advanced General Chemistry I (Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Do we see the world the way we do because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is? The ease with which we comprehend the visual world, and recognize objects and events, makes it tempting to think that the world is just the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the information available in the environment, when we try to build machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some specific visual capability\u2014for example, persons who can no longer recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know about vision from multiple scientific perspectives: perceptual psychology tells us about the process of seeing, and provides important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms; neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these mechanisms malfunction; neuroscience tells us about processes at the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field? MARISA CARRASCO is Collegiate Professor and Professor of Psychology and Neural Science, as well as a former Chair of the Psychology Department. Born and raised in Mexico City, she received her licentiate in psychology from the National University of Mexico and her Ph.D. in psychology (cognition and perception) from Princeton University. She conducts research in cognitive neuroscience, exploring the relation between the psychological and neural mechanisms involved in visual perception and attention. She has published many papers in the most prominent scientific journals in perception, in particular, and in science, in general. Her accomplishments have been recognized by prestigious awards and fellowships throughout her career, such as an American Association of University Women Fellowship, a National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation, a Cattell Fellowship, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. Finding New York City FRSEM-UA 498; class # 7291 Instructor: William Serrin  syllabus  Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. In this seminar, students explore, read, and write about\u2014and develop a deep understanding of\u2014New York City from diverse perspectives and by means of various media. We venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic areas, all five boroughs, out on the Hudson and East rivers, restaurants, parks, and the like. We examine New York history and how the city has changed over the decades, writing several pieces on what we see and read and what people tell us. In the end, all should have an understanding of how New York City began, how it has changed over time, what remains from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the future might be. This is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New York City as its laboratory. The seminar turns to reading the splendid books or sections from the splendid books that deal with important aspects of the history and life of New York City, among them The Island at the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties; Forgotten Patriots; The Devil\u2019s Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots and the Fight to Reconstruct America; Five Points; Positively 4th Street; and A Freewheelin\u2019 Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in the Sixties . It also considers how the image of New York City in the movies has changed over the decades, drawing in part on the book Celluloid Skyline . In addition, it uses parts of the Ken Burns PBS documentary series New York City . WILLIAM SERRIN is Collegiate Professor and Associate Professor of Journalism. Before joining NYU, he was for eight years the labor and workplace correspondent for the New York Times. He has written for numerous magazines, including Newsweek, Atlantic Monthly, American Heritage , and the Nation , as well as the Columbia Journalism Review and the Village Voice .

He also won the Sidney Hillman Foundation Award for outstanding labor coverage, and he was a member the Detroit Free Press team of reporters who won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the 1967 Detroit riots. In addition, he was a recipient of the George Polk Award for reporting on the Kent State killings in 1970. He is currently working on two new books: one a memoir of growing up in his hometown, an industrial town (Saginaw, Michigan), the other an examination of how, as industries emerge and grow in America, communities grow up and expand around them, then when the industries move or collapse, the communities that have served its citizens and country so well are often left to collapse and die.  Utopia and Apocalypse FRSEM-UA 499; class # 7294 Instructor: Eliot Borenstein  syllabus Monday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) and Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) The utopian impulse is the drive to create the perfect world; the apocalypse is the global cataclysm that is often considered utopia\u2019s prerequisite. In this seminar, we examine the development of the utopian tradition, as both literary genre and philosophical thought experiment. Among the questions to be considered: What is the relationship between utopia and the novel? How do we get from \u201chere\u201d (the imperfect world) to \u201cthere\u201d (the perfect one), and how is this journey enacted in fiction? Why are the family, gender, and sexuality so central to the utopian tradition? What is the utopian conception of pleasure? Utopia is often seen as the?culmination of historical progress, the goal toward which humanity has been striving. Later utopian (and anti-utopian) fictions often place their \u201cperfect\u201d societies in a post-apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and temporal dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint of history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials consist of fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including the works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels, More, Moore and Gibbons, and Plato. ELIOT BORENSTEIN, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Russian and Slavic Studies, has served as Chair of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies and as Director of the Morse Academic Plan. Before coming to NYU in 1995, he directed the Fulbright Program in the Russian Federation and taught at the University of Virginia.

In 2007, he published Overkill: Sex and Violence in Contemporary Russian Popular Culture , which received the AWSS award for best book in Slavic Gender Studies in 2008. Recently, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship to finish the companion volume, Catastrophe of the Week: Apocalyptic Entertainment in Post-Soviet Russia . He is a two-time recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. The New Worlds of Work and Care FRSEM-UA 500; class # 8327  syllabus  Instructor: Kathleen Gerson Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The early 21st century represents a period of immense social change in both the public world of work and the private world of caring for others. New technologies have blurred the boundary between home and work. New economic opportunities and pressures have sent women into the workplace. The rise of the \u201cnew economy\u201d has created jobs with more short-term flexibility, but less long-term security. And new options in intimate relationships have created more diverse and voluntary, but less predictable, family patterns. Taken together, these intertwined shifts represent a social transformation that is reshaping both the daily lives and life pathways of women and men. To explore the causes, consequences, and significance of these twin revolutions in work and care, the class addresses several questions. What does an overview of work, family, and gender changes tell us about where we are now and where we are going? What are the major dilemmas created by these changes, and how are people coping with these dilemmas? What are the implications for the future? And what can we do to enhance the opportunities and limit the insecurities of these new social arrangements? For the first half of the semester, students read, analyze, and discuss cutting-edge research; during the second half, students conduct their own research projects. KATHLEEN GERSON, Collegiate Professor and Professor of Sociology, is a recognized authority on the connections among gender, work, and family life in post-industrial societies. She has held visiting positions at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, the Russell Sage Foundation in New York City, and the Center for the Study of Status Passages in the Life Course at Bremen University, Germany. In addition to serving as President of the Eastern Sociological Society and Chair of the Family Section of the American Sociological Association, she has contributed to many research and policy initiatives on work, family, and gender issues, including service as a founding board member of the Work-Family Researchers Network and as a board member of the Council on Contemporary Families. Her professional awards include the Jessie Bernard Award, given by the American Sociological Association in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society; the William Goode Distinguished Book Award, given by the Family Section of the ASA for The Unfinished Revolution; the Rosabeth Kanter Award for Excellence in Work-Family Research; the Distinguished Feminist Lectureship on Women and Social Change, awarded by Sociologists for Women in Society; the Kingsley Birge Endowed Lecture, at Colby College; and the Charles Phelps Taft Endowed Lecture, at the University of Cincinnati. Her books include The Unfinished Revolution: Coming of Age in a New Era of Gender, Work, and Family ; The Time Divide: Family, Work, and Gender Inequality (with Jerry A. Jacobs); No Man\u2019s Land: Men\u2019s Changing Commitments to Family and Work; and Hard Choices: How Women Decide About Work, Career, and Motherhood.  Shamanism FRSEM-UA 501; class # 15017 Instructor: Bruce Grant  syllabus  Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. From New Age sweat lodges to Soviet Siberia, shamanic spirit mediums have been construed as everything from healers to magistrates to visionaries to political subversives. This course explores anthropological literature on shamanism in Asia and the Americas in order to ask how we constitute and appropriate the exotic in a variety of broadly construed religious settings. By focusing on the core figure of the shaman, we also attempt to track a twentieth-century history of anthropological reasoning. BRUCE GRANT is Professor of Anthropology and winner of the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. A specialist on cultural politics in the formerly communist world, he is the author of two award-winning books, In the Soviet House of Culture: A Century of Perestroikas and The Captive and the Gift: Cultural Histories of Sovereignty in Russia and the Caucasus.  Frontiers of Biology FRSEM-UA 502; class # 15019 Instructor: Edo Kussell  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Prerequisites: Both AP Biology 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential) and at least one additional AP science (or mathematics) score of 4 or 5 (or equivalent international credential). Biology has become an incredibly interdisciplinary science. Major breakthroughs often result from key collaborations between scientists inventing new technologies and biologists studying the fundamental questions of life. This seminar focuses on the latest discoveries in biology and the technological innovations that enable them. Through a combination of readings, lectures, and discussions, the seminar leapfrogs classical textbook biology and mere memorization to present science at the forefront of biological research. Topics that may be covered (always in great depth and detail) include metagenomics, synthetic biology, quantitative immunology, microbial ecology, and biology at the single-molecule level. Emphasis is placed on understanding how the scientific research process works in today\u2019s world. This demanding course is geared towards highly motivated individuals, with a superlative high school background in science and a deep passion for scientific inquiry, but is open to students in all majors. Each student is required to lead at least one class session, to interview a scientist (no family members or scientists working at any NYU-affiliated school), and to produce a long research paper with accompanying formal oral presentation. EDO KUSSELL is an Associate Professor of Biology and Physics, and a faculty in the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU. He is a recipient of both the Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award at the Scientific Interface and the McDonnell Foundation Research Award in Studying Complex Systems. Prof. Kussell's research is on evolutionary dynamics in general, with a focus on microorganisms. His lab studies bacterial adaptations to fluctuating environments, combining mathematical modeling, physics, and experimental biology. In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503; class # 7286 Instructor: Marcelle Clements Thursday, 2:15\u20134:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. We will read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is one of modern literature\u2019s most challenging and deeply pleasurable reads. The richest of the themes it explores is desire\u2014its remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence in the form of art. Often said to be the first modern fiction, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it combines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappointment. Although Marcel Proust (1871\u20131922) is often cited as France\u2019s greatest novelist (and the novelist\u2019s novelist), his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately, many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first fifty pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. But while In Search of Lost Time \u2019s prose style may have been its most radical contribution to the art of fiction, its vast, thrilling architecture cannot be understood until it has been read once in its entirety. In this intensive class, we will move at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric experience of reading the final volume, when we begin to understand the extraordinarily intimate relationship Proust creates with his reader. In-class creative writing exercises are designed to help with the reading and to expand an expressive, personal response. Reading assignments average 350 pages per week. MARCELLE CLEMENTS is Collegiate Professor and a Fellow of the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU. She is the author of a collection of essays, The Dog Is Us and Other Observations , a book of nonfiction, The Improvised Woman , and of two novels, Rock Me and, most recently, Midsummer . Her prizewinning articles and essays on the arts, culture, and politics have appeared in many national publications.  Spring 2014 American Wars, Past and Present: Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan FRSEM-UA 504; class # 8309 Instructor: Marilyn B. Young  syllabus  Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The course will consider the last two major wars of the 20th century and the first two wars of the 21st century. It will begin with the history, memory, and subsequent political uses of the Vietnam War. We will then move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation Desert Storm), which was shaped by the way the administration of President George H.W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was fought in the shadow of Vietnam analogies. Finally, the war in Afghanistan, launched in response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and goals, has been shaped by all three of the preceding wars. We shall examine these wars through primary documents and secondary sources as well as the abundance of documentary and fiction film in which they have all been represented. The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history teach? What does it teach? MARILYN B. YOUNG, Collegiate Professor and Professor of History, is a former Chair of the History Department. Her teaching and her writing focus on U.S. foreign policy. Her books include The Vietnam Wars, 1945\u20131990, The Rhetoric of Empire: American China Policy, 1895\u20131901, Transforming Russia and China: Revolutionary Struggle in the 20th Century , with William Rosenberg, and Human Rights and Revolutions , with Lynn Hunt and Jeffrey Wasserstrom. She has also edited several collections of essays on the recent wars in Iraq and, most recently, Bombing Civilians: A 20th-Century History . She was Director of the Project on the Cold War as a Global Conflict at NYU\u2019s International Center for Advanced Study in 2001\u20132004. She has been the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and of an American Council of learned Societies Fellowship. Twice she has won the College\u2019s Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence, and she is currently co-director of the Tamiment Center on the Cold War. She is currently president-elect of the Society of Historians of American Foreign Relations.  Helen of Troy and Her Ghosts FRSEM-UA 505, class # 15880 Instructor: Liana Theodoratou  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon In Homer\u2019s Iliad , Helen, reflecting on her destiny, proclaims that her function is not primarily to be a woman, but to be first and foremost a story. \u201cOn us the gods have set an evil destiny,\u201d she explains, \u201cthat we should be a singer\u2019s theme / for generations to come\u201d (Il.6.357-58). Taking its point of departure from the Helen of ancient Greece\u2014the daughter of Zeus and Leda\u2014this course traces the various Helens whose stories have been told throughout the history of Western literature\u2014from the Helen of Homer to that of Sappho, Stesichorus, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides, Pierre Ronsard, Christopher Marlowe, Gerard de Nerval, Jean Giraudoux, W.B.Yeats, Paul Val\u00e9ry, Yannis Ritsos, and beyond. Within this literary trajectory, Helen becomes a means of tracing the story of literature itself. She is composed of all the ideas and desires that have been projected onto her body. In the wording of the modernist poet, H. D. (Hilda Doolittle), \u201cHelen is the Greek drama.\u201d In each instance, Helen\u2019s identity is shattered across an entire history of representations of her relation to literature and poetry and, in the process, she even becomes another name for literature and poetry. Tracing this history permits us to think about the survival of the past in the present, about the role and place of representation in the establishment of identity in general, and about the way in which the present is haunted by the phantoms of the past. LIANA THEODORATOU is Clinical Professor and Director of the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies and Director of the NYU in Athens Program. She is a recipient of the College\u2019s Outstanding Teaching Award and of its Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. She has written widely on ancient and modern Greek poetry and has translated several works by, among others, Foucault, Althusser, and Derrida into Modern Greek. She is currently completing a book on the politics of mourning in contemporary Greek poetry, entitled Mourning Becomes Greece.  Game Theory and the Humanities FRSEM-UA 506; class # 15980 Instructor: Steven Brams  syllabus Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Game theory is a mathematical theory of strategy that has been applied to the analysis of conflict and cooperation in such fields as economics, political science, and biology. In this seminar, we discuss more unusual applications to history, literature, philosophy, the Bible, theology, and law. No mathematical background beyond high school mathematics is assumed, but a willingness to learn and apply sophisticated reasoning to analyze the interactions of players in games is essential. Among the applications to be discussed are Abraham's decision to offer his son, Isaac, for sacrifice in the Bible; choices made by accused witches and their persecutors in medieval witch trials; Lady Macbeth's incitement of Macbeth to murder King Duncan in Shakespeare's play; several strategic games played by presidents and their antagonists in domestic crises (the Civil War, the Great Depression, Watergate) and international crises (the Cuban missile crisis, the Iran hostage crisis); and coping mechanisms used by characters in catch-22 games (including those in Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22) . STEVEN J. BRAMS is Professor of Politics. He is the author of several books\u2014most recently, Mathematics and Democracy and Game Theory and the Humanities \u2014that apply game theory and social choice theory to voting and elections, bargaining and fairness, international relations, and the Bible, theology and literature. He holds two patents for fair-division algorithms and is chairman of the advisory board of Fair Outcomes, Inc. He is a former president of the Peace Science Society and of the Public Choice Society. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Guggenheim Fellow, and was a Visiting Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation.   Spring 2014 What is Memory FRSEM-UA 507; class # 14597 Instructor: Suzanne England  syllabus  Wednesday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia. Thanks to the written records that serve as our cultural memory, we know that memory has been a topic of inquiry at least since those records began. Today\u2019s philosophers, psychologists, and literary scholars are continuing to hone the concept of the self as it was understood by John Locke, David Hume, and Ralph Waldo Emerson among others, as a dynamic tension between memory and consciousness. Together this work pursues such questions as How is memory embodied? How and why do we forget? What is the connection between memory and the self\u2014and with language and story-telling\u2014and with moral and ethical reasoning? What events are best forgotten and how do we go about forgetting them? The proliferation of memorials of war and conflict today has led some cultural critics to wonder if so much remembering gums up the salve of forgetting so necessary for the healing process of forgiving. The course is structured around six units: Life Memories, The Idea of Memory, The Science of Memory, The Art of Memory, Cultural Memory, and Forgetting. Readings represent the full spectrum of western thinking about memory, from Plato to the Pew Research Center\u2019s report on memory and the internet. It is hoped that in addition to learning a great deal about memory and forgetting as academic topics, students come away from the course having gained new insights into the workings of their own memories and having developed a personal practice of memory that serves their growth as individuals long after their memories of the course itself have dimmed. SUZANNE ENGLAND is a Professor at the Silver School of Social Work at NYU. She holds degrees from the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Illinois Chicago, and Tulane University. She was Dean of the Silver School at NYU from 2001 to 2009 and Dean at the Tulane Graduate School of Social Work from 1994 to 2001. Professor England\u2019s teaching includes methods of human inquiry, social policy and politics, narrative approaches to policy and advocacy, management and organizational practice, and ethical leadership. Her current research is on narratives\u2014literary, dramatic, autobiographical, and popular culture representations of aging, old age, memory, caregiving and domestic space. This research is at the nexus of moral philosophy and memory studies as she seeks to develop frameworks for examining memory and forgetting in moral performances, and the expressions of meta-narratives and archetypes of aging, old age and age-related dementias in contemporary literature and popular culture. What is Memory FRSEM-UA 507; class # 16468 Instructor: Martha Rust  syllabus  Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The questions \u201cWhat is memory?\u201d and \u201cWhat is forgetting?\u201d have intrigued thinkers for millennia.

Spring 2014 Great Inventions in World History: Breakthrough Technologies that Changed the Course of Civilizations FRSEM-UA 508; class # 14598 Instructor: Richard W. Hull  syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) This seminar is an exploration in human ingenuity, from antiquity to the twentieth century. It focuses on eighteen key inventions that profoundly affected the course of civilizations and that changed the way people lived and thought about themselves and the world around them. It examines the origins of the inventions, the individuals or groups that developed or conceived them, their initial impact on the societies of their inventors, their diffusion to other cultures and ultimately their impact on a global scale. It considers the transfer of technical knowledge from one country or culture to another and how it is modified and adapted by the recipients and may trigger a different but improved or related invention. In the process, we examine the interaction of technologies and society. Some inventions constitute \u201cbricolage,\u201d taking available resources and cobbling them together to create entirely new uses. Each invention we study generated a veritable revolution in the way humans interacted with each other, organized their lives, and mobilized their human and natural resources. In some cases we consider how specific inventions improved the human condition and/or degraded it. We explore the very idea of \u201cinvention\u201dand weigh situations or intellectual challenges that gave rise to inventive impulses. We pose numerous questions: Why do some societies enthusiastically embrace a given invention or innovation while others reject it as see it as a threat? How do some groups attempt to monopolize an invention and endeavor to prevent its spread to other governments or cultures? The scope of the course is expansive, running from such geniuses as al-Khwarizmi and his algorithms in the ninth century C.E. to Steve Jobs and the computer in the twentieth. RICHARD HULL is Professor of History. A specialist in African and European history, he is the author of numerous books, including African Cities and Towns, Modern Africa , and Munyakare: African Civilizations , as well as coauthor of the two-volume World Civilizations . He has received both the Great Teacher Award and three Golden Dozen Awards for Teaching Excellence.  Spring 2014 Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace FRSEM-UA 509; class # 14599 Instructor: Anne Lounsbery  syllabus Tuesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Our first priority is a careful reading of Tolstoy\u2019s massive novel (if it is in fact a \u201cnovel\u201d: this is one of the questions we address), with the goal of understanding how the text works. We also consider the book\u2019s historical context, the sources that Tolstoy drew on, its place in his oeuvre and thought, its place in the Russian tradition and in \u201cworld\u201d literature, and the various uses that have been made of it since its initial publication. ANNE LOUNSBERY is Associate Professor of Russian Literature and chair of the Department of Russian &amp; Slavic Studies. Her Ph.D. is in Comparative Literature, and she writes chiefly about nineteenth-century Russian, European and American prose. Her first book Thin Culture, High Art was on Russian and American literature; she is currently finishing a book on Russian novels and geographic space, Life Is Elsewhere: Symbolic Geography in the Russian Novel . Tolstoy's War and Peace is Professor Lounsbery's favorite book, and she never gets tired of re-reading it (most recently last summer, in Russian, on her iPhone). She has won the Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence and enjoys working closely with undergraduates. Philosophizing with Shakespeare FRSEM-UA 510; class # 16302 Instructor: Tom Gerety  syllabus Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. One of the fascinating things about William Shakespeare is that we can never be sure if the exchanges and speeches he gives to his characters show his own convictions or, more likely, his conception of how kings and queens and lovers would think and feel. This seminar examines several of his greatest plays, including King Lear, Hamlet, The Tempest , and The Merchant of Venice . We study these and a few other plays in depth and with special attention to the ideas and arguments in them about life and death, the relations between the sexes, and between the classes. We consider the views his characters articulate about love and hatred, God and morality, virtue and vice. We try to understand what he thought about government and coercion, and about the limits of freedom and the inevitability of oppression and tragedy. We read (and see, on stage and on film) his plays and look to his great sources such as the King James Bible and the Essays of Michel de Montaigne. We learn all that we can about his life in Stratford and London, the world of the stage and court, and the great political and religious controversies of his time in England and Europe. We find that Shakespeare was in many ways not just an artist but a philosopher. His gift for summarizing and personifying ideas make him an elusive but important figure in the history of ideas. He stands on the bridge, as it were, between the Renaissance and the modern world. His ideas\u2013or those to which he gave such powerful voice\u2013propelled England and Europe towards the modern world of science, skepticism and materialism that we now inhabit. TOM GERETY, Collegiate Professor, joined the NYU faculty in 2005, having first come to NYU two years earlier to head the Brennan Center for Justice at the Law School. Before then he served as President of Amherst College from 1994 to 2003 and of Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1989 to 1994. From 1986 to 1989 he was the Dean and Nippert Professor at the College of Law of the University of Cincinnati. As a law professor he taught and wrote on constitutional law and political philosophy, with a special emphasis on First Amendment freedoms, including speech, privacy, and religious freedom. With Judy Woodruff, he wrote and narrated a PBS series, Visions of the Constitution , funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. He is the author, most recently, of The Freshman Who Hated Socrates . The Remarkable Normans: Europe from 911 to 1204 FRSEM-UA 511; class # 16303 Instructor: Jill N. Claster  syllabus  Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Few people in all of European history can boast a history of achievements comparable to that of the Normans in the nearly three hundred years following the founding of the duchy of Normandy in 911. From the tenth century until 1204, there was not a single important event in which the Normans were not involved or did not play a pivotal role. This course follows the Norman expansion: the conquest of England, of Sicily and southern Italy, of large parts of France, and cities in the eastern Mediterranean. The Normans were initiators and leaders of the crusades to the Holy Land and they fought as well in Spain against the Muslims. Although these descendants of Viking invaders never lost their taste for adventure and their warlike spirit, the Normans were also great organizers and the government in Normandy, as well as in the places they conquered, were the most advanced and efficient in all of Europe. They left a rich legacy in every field imaginable: art and architecture, religious institutions, political organization, and educational institutions. The Normans stood at the forefront of a long period of material, cultural and spiritual progress in Europe, and this seminar studies the many gifts the Normans gave to European civilization. JILL N. CLASTER is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages; she has taught and studied the era of the Crusades extensively and is the author of the recently published book, Sacred Violence: The European Crusades to the Middle East, 1096\u20131396 .

Spring 2014 Nuclear Energy FRSEM-UA 512; class # 14600 Instructor: Antoine Cerfon  syllabus  Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Nuclear power currently provides 13% of the world's electricity and is expected to play an important role in the diversified energy mix that countries are developing to meet the world's growing energy needs. As a carbon-free, continuous energy source, it is an attractive solution for base-load electricity production, and a desirable complement to intermittent sources such as solar and wind. However, it also faces serious technological, economical and societal challenges that question its development. In this seminar, we follow a multidisciplinary approach to explore the different dimensions of the debate about nuclear power. We look at the basic nuclear physics in the core of power plants, the different power plant concepts and their engineering solutions, the nuclear fuel cycle, the issues of waste, safety and proliferation, nuclear power economics, and the place of nuclear energy in the global energy landscape. ANTOINE CERFON is Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. He obtained his Ph.D. in the Nuclear Science and Engineering department at MIT, and stayed there for two more years as a post-doctoral researcher before joining NYU in 2012. His main area of study is in plasma physics for particle accelerators and nuclear fusion applications. Introduction to Aesthetics FRSEM-UA 513; class # 16306 Instructor: Eduardo Subirats  syllabus  Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar focuses on four major Western theorists of aesthetics: Schiller, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche. It will reconstruct central categories such as form, beauty, genius, and myth. It also will analyze four programmatic works of art: modern \u201ccubism\u201d (Picasso), a Greek tragedy (Aeschylus\u2019 Prometheus Bound ), a German trickster ( Till Eugenspiegel ), and a French revolutionary painter (Courbet\u2019s Atelier ). Its ultimate goal is a critique of contemporary artistic decadence and anti-aesthetics. EUDARDO SUBIRATS is Professor of Spanish and Portuguese. His research interests include Spanish intellectual history; the Counter-Reformation and the colonization of Spanish America; the Enlightenment; avant-garde theory, artistic movements in Spain and Latin America; and the modern Latin American and Spanish essay. Among his many publications are Linterna M\u00e1gica; El continente vac\u00edo; Da vanguarda ao p\u00f3s-moderno; Memoria y exilio; Viaje al fin del Para\u00edso. Un ensayo sobre Am\u00e9rica latina; and Filosof\u00eda y tiempo final.  Spring 2014 Xenophon of Athens\u2014Cavalry Commander and Socratic Philosopher FRSEM-UA 514; class # 14601 Instructor: Vincent Renzi  syllabus  Tuesday, 12:30-3:15 p.m. Required Cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. The greatest ancient you\u2019ve never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425\u2013355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, student of Socrates, and renowned author. His heroism leading the army of the Ten Thousand inspired the conquests of Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. His political philosophy informed the thought of Cicero, Machiavelli, Franklin, and Jefferson. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the pre-college curriculum. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Oeconomicus, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anabasis , and the film based on the latter, The Warriors (1979). VINCENT RENZI is Clinical Associate Professor in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture and of Classics. He serves as a director of undergraduate studies for the College Core Curriculum, NYU\u2019s general education curriculum. A scholar of ancient Greek philosophy, he also has interests in arts and aesthetics and in 19th and 20th century philosophy, and is a recipient of the College's Golden Dozen Award for Teaching Excellence. Perception of Art FRSEM-UA 515; class # 16494 Instructor: Denis Pelli  syllabus  Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. We apply the scientific methods of perception research, psychophysics, to explore and understand how people experience art. A few artists (e.g. a painter and a photographer) visit class or invite us to their studios to talk about the creative process and answer questions. We visit current shows in museums and galleries that address questions that arise in class--for example, do artists distinguish painting for themselves from painting for the public? Why is a figure like Philip Guston so popular among fellow painters, but unpopular with the public and critics? Pairs of students collaborate on an experiment answering some question or topic bearing on the perception of art, which is written up as a term project. DENIS PELLI, Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at NYU, has contributed new measurement techniques, major empirical findings, and useful theoretical accounts of object recognition. As a psychophysicist, he invented many widely used and highly cited methods for testing how vision works. His 150 papers on object recognition have been cited nearly 10,000 times. His scientific expertise is complemented by an informal knowledge of art. He grew up in a family of architects and a landscape designer (Pelli and Balmori) that spends most of its time together talking about how things look and why. He enjoys sketching and also helped a choreographer produce a ballet designed to be seen in peripheral vision. For more on his work, visit http://denispelli.com.  Spring 2014 Architecture in the City FRSEM-UA 516; class # 14602 Instructor: Marvin Trachtenberg  syllabus  Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) This seminar introduces students to key themes in western architecture from prehistory to postmodernity. It bridges immediacy and history using the buildings and spaces of our city as a primary object of study. Key texts are discussed, but emphasis is placed on the experience and understanding of buildings and their sites through media (photography and film) and direct encounters with the built environment of New York City. Themes such as the ecological basis of architecture, the question of nature, culture, and landscape, and architecture as idea, process, artifact and space are explored along with other topics relevant to the understanding of architecture. As an undergraduate, MARVIN TRACHTENBERG studied English literature at Yale with Harold Bloom. At the the Institute of Fine Arts, he turned to premodern architecture under Wolfgang Lotz, Richard Pommer, and especially Richard Krautheimer, who supervised his monograph on the Florentine Campanile (awarded the Society of Architectural Historians\u2019 Hitchcock Prize). After a return to modernity with his Statue of Liberty and a decade producing a survey of architectural history ( Architecture from Prehistory to Postmodernity ), Trachtenberg again focused on pre-modern Italy with his radically revisionist (and award-winning) study of trecento urbanism, Dominion of the Eye . Issues raised by structures with long building histories and multiple architects led him to formulate the ideas discussed in Building-in-Time from Giotto to Alberti and Modern Oblivion (George Sarton Prize in History of Science, Ghent University). He is currently completing a book, on new discursive terms, for Yale University Press on Brunelleschi and the Pazzi Chapel. Since 1967 he has taught at the Institute of Fine Arts, where he is Edith Kitzmiller Professor of Art History. Spain in 1492: From the 'Moor's Last Sigh' to the Conquest of the New World FRSEM-UA 517; class # 16558 Instructor: Sarah Pearce  syllabus  Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. The year 1492 in Spain is the very definition of a watershed. Four major, related events took place that completely altered the social, political, religious, intellectual, literary and linguistic landscape: the city of Granada, the last Muslim principality in Spain, fell to the Catholic crown of Castile and Leon; the order was signed and carried out expelling or forcing the conversion of Spain\u2019s Jews; with Spanish backing, Christopher Columbus made his first voyage to the New World; and the first grammar of a vernacular Romance language, Castilian, appeared in print and was dedicated to the queen in honor of her imperial ambitions. This course examines literary and historical writing about these events. Through careful reading of primary sources and attention to modern historians\u2019 rhetoric in writing about 1492, students explore how these events were implicated in the formation of national and religious identities in late medieval and early modern Spain. Reading in a wide variety of genres leads to diverse writing assignments in a variety of genres to help prepare students for further coursework in the liberal arts. S.J. PEARCE is an assistant professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. She returns to NYU after having held the Apfelbaum Fellowship in Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania during 2012-13, where she completed a book-length manuscript entitled \"No Achievement But Through Arabic\" in which she explores the attitudes of medieval Spanish Jews towards reading and writing in the Arabic language. She tweets about the Middle Ages @homophonous. Urban Objects: How Things in the City Make Life Possible or (Almost) Impossible FRSEM-UA 518; class # 16559 Instructor: Harvey Molotch  syllabus Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon We concentrate on very ordinary things: trash bins, stop signs, lamp posts, turnstiles, fences, and whatever else we encounter in the course of public city life. We trace out where these things come from, what caused them to take their specific forms and the way they cost or benefit social groups in particular ways (e.g. women versus men, kids versus adults, rich versus poor). Our interest is in public space, public life, and private benefits as revealed by the things we see, touch, jump over, ignore, vandalize and use. All along, we read about urban space, the use and abuse of the city, and the role of physical objects in our lives. We do first-hand studies of people\u2019s encounters with these artifacts in real time. Each student chooses one or more objects for preliminary write-up(s) and then hones in on one for a final term paper. HARVEY MOLOTCH, Professor of Sociology and Metropolitan Studies, has authored many articles and books, the most recent being Against Security: How We Go Wrong at Airports, Subways, and Other Sites of Ambiguous Danger . A prior book, Where Stuff Comes From, analyzes the world of product development and design. His awards include: Distinguished Contribution to the Discipline of Sociology, Award for Lifetime Achievement in Urban and Community Studies, and Lifetime Achievement in Sociology of the Environment and Technology.  Encountering Martin Luther King, Jr. FRSEM-UA 519; class # 16575 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt  syllabus  Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Physics I (Tuesday and Thursday 12:30\u20131:45 p.m.)  Few historical figures are more revered or transcendent than Martin Luther King Jr. But as David Levering Lewis wrote thirty-five years ago, America\u2019s canonization of him has draped him in such a cloak of mythology that \u201cin a sense we have sought to remember him by forgetting him.\u201d This course seeks to vividly remember the human being at the center of the most significant popular movement in U.S. history, one that took up the unfinished legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction eighty years after the nation turned its back on social and racial justice. Students explore King\u2019s thought, oratory, character, and public actions in a way that will make him unforgettable to them. We consider his tenaciously held philosophy of nonviolent social change, and his growth from a southern Baptist minister to a leading civil rights activist to a visionary leader of global human rights and peace. We ask if he was a radical or a moderate and why he felt history had \u201chunted him down,\u201d as he once claimed to fellow activist Rosa Parks. In what ways can new information about his inner conflicts and personal flaws change our appreciation of his moral stature? And how do we understand him in the context of his times, amidst fellow activists, adversaries, elected leaders, and critics during one of the most volatile, freedom-advancing periods of American history? Using film and little-known radio interviews as part of the class research, as well a challenging immersion in some of the most significant King literature, the course, coming in the fiftieth anniversary year of the March on Washington, makes King and his times newly relevant to our own vastly changed but still violence-prone and violence-haunted world. PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities, and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five books, including Looking for Lincoln, The American President , and P.T. Barnum: America\u2019s Greatest Showman . He was also writer and co-producer of more than a dozen documentary films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and others, including the ten-part PBS series The American President , and the sixteen part Freedom: A History of US. Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in Annandale, New York. Writing the Self and New York FRSEM-UA 520; class # 18468 Instructor: David J. Dent Tuesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Thursday 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. In this course students begin the semester by dusting off their college admissions essays. The first assignment requires students to explore the ideas of the personal essay beyond the individual and develop the essay into a piece of narrative nonfiction. Beyond that first assignment, students spend the semester exploring the city of New York through a series of writing assignments on urban life. Students also read several classic pieces of literary journalism, personal essays and fiction about life in New York City. DAVID J. DENT is Associate Professor at New York University where he holds a joint appointment at the Arthur Carter Journalism Institute and in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis. He created the course \u201cDeconstructing Obama\u201d and teaches courses in journalism and non-fiction writing.

The organization uses the tools of journalism to help middle and high school students become better writers, a method detailed in The Best Essay of Your Life.   Spring 2014 Visuality and Literature FRSEM-UA 521; class # 14603 Instructor: Jennifer Cayer  syllabus  Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) In this course we examine twentieth-century and contemporary essays, novels, short stories and plays that are preoccupied with the visual, perform visually, or integrate images within narrative. Some of these works respond directly to pieces of visual art or analyze forms of seeing; others include images such as photographs or drawings. This is a writing-intensive course. While actively discussing the course materials, students consistently and frequently engage them through critical and creative, formal and informal writing. One of our goals is to deepen our own practices of seeing and using visual evidence as a method toward writing personal, exploratory, and persuasive essays. Topics may include: memoir, documentary works, photography, film adaptations, comics, graphic novels, artists books and surrealism.

Spring 2014 Into the Urban Wild: Nature Writing and the City FRSEM-UA 522; class # 14604 Instructor: Tara K. Parmiter Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) Essayist Loren Eiseley asserts that \u201ceven in New York City there are patches of wilderness,\u201d encouraging his readers to rethink the way they define and limit their use of this loaded word. In this course we examine both the idea and the manifestation of these wildernesses, questioning the assumptions and the rhetoric we use when talking about the existence, construction, representation, cultivation, or manipulation of nature in our urban environment. We immerse ourselves in classics of American nature writing and then venture into the city, using our texts as lenses for reading such spaces as Central Park, the High Line, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, and the American Natural History Museum. Readings include selections by Henry David Thoreau, John Burroughs, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, Loren Eiseley, Annie Dillard, Terry Tempest Williams, bell hooks, Wendell Berry, and William Cronon, among others. Students compose both critical analyses of the texts and their own nature writing based on their exploration of and research into their own \u201cpatch\u201d of New York wilderness. TARA K. PARMITER is a Senior Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program and a Mentor in the Undergraduate Writing Tutors Program. Her research interests include literature and the environment, turn-of-the-twentieth century women\u2019s literature, children\u2019s literature, travel narratives, and popular culture.

Spring 2014 Reading Toni Morrison FRSEM-UA 523; class # 14612 Instructor: Elizabeth McHenry Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Winner of the 1993 Nobel Prize for Literature, Toni Morrison was the eighth woman and first African American ever to receive that award. In its citation, the Swedish Academy praised her as someone \u201cwho, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality.\u201d This course seeks to identify and to examine that \u201cessential aspect of American reality.\u201d We read the writings of Morrison, exploring the ways in which she represents history, identity, nation, race, gender, sexuality, and community in novels and essays that both challenge and complicate our understanding of these themes. Our aim is to understand the formal aspects of her writing\u2014how her novels \u201cwork\u201d as literature\u2014as well as the cultural and historical interventions it makes. We also take up questions about Morrison\u2019s reputation among contemporary readers of her fiction, and the various outlets, including Oprah\u2019s Book Club, where it has been championed. Students taking this class should expect to read great books that inspire hard conversations about race, gender, sexuality, and American social and cultural history; through our reading, several short papers, and a research project of their own design students hone their skills as critical readers, original researchers, and persuasive writers. ELIZABETH MCHENRY, Associate Professor of English, is the author of Forgotten Readers: Recovering the Lost History of African American Literary Societies , which received the John Hope Franklin Book Award, the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing Book History Award, and the American Library Association Award for Non-Fiction.

Spring 2014 Atlantic Migrations since 1600 FRSEM-UA 524; class # 14629 Instructor: Joe Lee  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The movement of people, voluntarily and involuntarily, from Europe and Africa across the Atlantic to North and South America since about 1600 is one of the epochal events in world history. It has had a major impact\u2014and in many cases has left an indelible mark\u2014on the histories of both the sending and receiving of societies and cultures, whether the multitudes involved moved as free men and women, as indentured servants, or as slaves. This course seeks to understand the causes and consequences, economic, social, political and cultural, of these massive movements of human beings. JOE LEE has been Professor of History and Irish Studies at NYU since 2002, and is Glucksman Chair of Irish Studies and Director of Glucksman Ireland House NYU.

Fern\u00e1ndez Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Experimental Physics I (Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Prerequisite: reading knowledge of Spanish and/or a score of 4 or 5 on any AP Spanish exam (or international equivalent). According to demographers, in the near future one out of every three New Yorkers will be of Hispanic origin. Far from being a recent phenomenon, the presence of Spanish-speaking people in the city can be traced back almost to the origins of the city in the seventeenth century. In the first part of this course we study the history of links between New York City and the Spanish-speaking world, from the arrival of 23 Sephardic Jews to the town of New Amsterdam in 1654, to the arrival of Spanish refugees fleeing from Fascism in the early 1940s. During the second part of the course, participants contribute to the creation of a website that will map and document traces of Spain and Spanish-speakers in the city of New York. We make a number of field trips during the semester, and one of the assignments is to design and script a walking tour. Readings include texts by Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed (Cuba), Bernardo Vega (Puerto Rico) and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca (Spain). JAMES D. FERN\u00c1NDEZ is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese.

He is the author of Apology to Apostrophe: Autobiography and the Rhetoric of Self-Representation in Spain.  Spring 2014 Biography's Many Lives FRSEM-UA 526; class # 14605 Instructor: Victoria Olsen  syllabus  Thursday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) The genre of biography has traced lives of \"famous men\" since Plutarch and Boswell's Johnson, but its conventional forms and techniques have come into question over the last century. This course examines how biography provides a window into different periods, cultures, and disciplines and how it has had to stretch to incorporate new voices, methodologies, and techniques. From Virginia Woolf's Orlando to Rebecca Skloot's Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, biography has pushed the boundaries of literary form and scientific knowledge. We read a broad range of subjects and styles\u2014exploring issues of research, writing, and reading\u2014to become biographers of the genre itself. VICTORIA OLSEN, Ph.D. is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program, where she teaches Writing the Essay to freshmen at Tisch and Writing and Speaking in the Disciplines to undergraduates in CAS. She has been a writing consultant and mentor to writing tutors in psychology, biology, philosophy, and history courses. She is the author of the biography From Life: Julia Margaret Cameron and Victorian Photography.  Spring 2014 Cultures of Science and Belief FRSEM-UA 527; class # 14992 Instructor: Noelle J. Mol\u00e9  syllabus   Monday and Wednesday, 2:00-3:15 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon We regularly take for granted that scientific knowledge is objective, a universal truth unchanged by history and culture. The laws of physics are just as true in Indonesia as they are in Mexico or the United States. Yet we also know that scientific knowledge is constantly in flux. What we \u201cknew\u201d to be true yesterday (e.g., the world is flat) is not true today, and new discoveries revolutionize what we knew (e.g., germ theory, epigenetics). This seminar positions science along a spectrum of worldviews\u2014explanatory models that provide causal reasons and underlying logics for events and actions\u2014a spectrum that includes magic, occultism, witchcraft, science, spirituality, and religion. A single hurricane might be explained, within particular historical and cultural contexts, as being sent by a witch\u2019s curse, a moving cold front, or an angry god. How we position ourselves between these ways of knowing is not, of course, mutually exclusive and the threshold between the categories is actually more blurred than we might initially expect. Interrogating the similarities and differences between \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cbelief,\u201d this course questions our deeply held assumptions regarding the neutrality of science and the so-called backwardness of folk belief. How do socio-cultural contexts and economic systems shape the production of scientific knowledge? Why do certain theories achieve recognition as rational and correct? We explore the social, economic, and political implications of these hierarchies of knowledge, and examine how they shape how we experience our own bodies, our own feelings, and even our own minds. NOELLE J. MOL\u00c9 is a cultural anthropologist and author of Labor Disorders in Neoliberal Italy: Mobbing, Well-being and the Workplace . She is currently investigating the rise of scientific skepticism and supernatural beliefs in Italy as twin responses to a millennial crisis in knowledge production. She is a Senior Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program.  Spring 2014 The Art of Note Taking FRSEM-UA 528; class # 14606 Instructor: Louis Bury Wednesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 3:30\u20134:30 p.m. Taking notes is first and foremost a utilitarian act, a way of recording information for the purposes of future use and improved retention. But notes also possess, importantly, an aesthetic dimension: splayed across the page in poetic fragments, they present a veritable graph of a mind in motion. In this course we consider note taking as both an aesthetic and utilitarian act. Our course readings focus on exemplary notes, diaries, and journals by prominent 20th century writers and artists, as well as older species of textual response such as Talmudic commentary and marginalia on Medieval manuscripts. We may also consider contemporary forms of digital writing that verge on note taking, such as blog posts, tweets, and Internet commentary. We use these texts as both source material and inspiration for our own extensive note taking. The goal is not simply to help you to become a better note taker but to help you understand how note taking is itself a form of writing and of thinking and not merely preparation for the \"real\" writing that you submit to your professors. Course requirements include: weekly reading and note taking; a midterm presentation; one short essay; and a final research project, developed out of your weekly notes. LOUIS BURY is a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program. His first book, Exercises in Criticism: The Theory and Practice of Literary Constraint (Dalkey Archive Press, forthcoming) applies rules and restrictions in order to write poetic, autobiographical literary criticism. He is currently taking notes for a book on literary note taking.  Spring 2014 Sensual Shifts: From Looking to Listening in Modernist Literature FRSEM-UA 529; class # 14607 Instructor: Angela Frattarola  syllabus Monday and Wednesday, 3:30-4:45 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). From Greek philosophy to the Enlightenment, vision was the privileged sense. Traditionally associated with knowledge and rationality, vision encourages a subject to keep a distanced, analytical perspective of an object. But does this always have to be the case? Can the other senses allow new ways of conceiving of and experiencing the relationship between the self and the world? This seminar begins by examining the dominance of vision in modernity and turns to audition as a way of thinking about alternative perceptions of the self and the world. We accomplish this by closely reading modernist novels that suggest a growing skepticism toward vision and heightened attention to sound and listening. In order to think about why modernists brought sound to the forefront of their art, we attempt to gain a sense of the modernist soundscape and the new auditory technologies of the time. Readings for the course consist of essays from sound studies as well as novels by Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, Jean Rhys, and James Joyce.

Spring 2014 Rediscovering Bacchic Revelry FRSEM-UA 530; class # 15031 Instructor: Megan Shea  syllabus Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). When we think about the staging of ancient Greek theater, we often envision a static stage where a masked man recites a lengthy monologue in an outdoor theater. But such a vision hardly describes the dynamic celebration of music, sexuality, and poetry that infused the City Dionysia and the Lenaia\u2014the Athenian festivals centered on tragedy and comedy in the sixth through the fourth Centuries B.C.E. In this seminar, we reimagine the performance of Greek theater by witnessing current productions of Greek plays, engaging with New York City\u2019s various collections of Greek art objects, studying contemporary festivals and celebrations, poring through critical interpretations of Greek history, and returning to textual evidence (the plays!). Beyond reconstructing our own understandings of ancient performance, we use the discord between our original scenarios of Greek performance and our revisions to evaluate how we conceive of Western civilization\u2019s past. Weekly response papers, a performance/design project, and a final research paper help awaken our sense of ancient performative acts. MEGAN SHEA is a language lecturer in NYU\u2019s Expository Writing Program. She received her Ph.D. in Theater Arts from Cornell University, where she studied women\u2019s performance in ancient Greece and the contemporary West. While teaching at Cornell, she received the Gertrude Spencer Student Portfolio Award, and she has received several Excellence in Teaching awards while at NYU. Dr. Shea has published articles in The Journal for Dramatic Theory and Criticism and TheatreForum . She recently premiered her translation of Euripides\u2019 Cyclops at Dixon Place.  Spring 2014 Left Brain, Right Brain, Whole Brain: Acts of Knowledge, Discovery, and Creation FRSEM-UA 531; class # 14608 Instructor: David Ellis  syllabus  Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Artists and scientists are often split into separate camps in the university and in our collective imagination; this split can even divide our individual minds. \u201cLeft brains\u201d\u2014the analytical, logical, objective among us\u2014become engineers, biologists, and bankers while \u201cright brains\u201d\u2014intuitive, thoughtful, subjective\u2014are the painters, philosophers, and social workers of the world. In practice, in the science lab or in the artist\u2019s studio, these distinctions may be more porous than we popularly believe. This seminar explores the interplay between reasoning, knowledge, belief, discovery, and creativity\u2014acts of mind common to all fields in the academy. Whether presented to us in the \u201creal world,\u201d the arts, or philosophy, we will wrestle with conundrums which resist easy solution. We explore many branches\u2014logic, physics, neurology, psychology, literature, film, visual and performance art\u2014hunting for approaches to understanding which we then put into practice. We work towards the goal of \u201cunderstanding our understanding,\u201d as the artist Matthew Goulish phrases it, in order to exploit the twinned powers of rationality and creativity. Trips to MoMath (Museum of Mathematics), MoMA, and other outings are planned. In his \u201cright-brained\u201d work as a poet, fiction writer, and visual artist, DAVID ELLIS explores science topics with a humanities approach, such as the nature of time, memory, sensory perception, social dynamics, and spatial relationships. His work in NYU\u2019s Writing in the Disciplines program has taken him into a range of \u201cleft-brained\u201d classrooms, from astrophysics to psychology, and at the City University of New York he teamed up with a geologist and a classicist who specializes in Roman artifacts to teach a series a classes with shared research and creative practices, which was the basis of their work \u201cVolcanoes, Vases, and Creation Stories.\u201d He teaches in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. Natural and Artificial Intelligence FRSEM-UA 532; class # 18663 Instructor: Gary Marcus  syllabus Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Monday, 2:00\u20133:00 p.m. Prerequisite: Programming experience recommended. Who's smarter\u2014Siri or Einstein? Is a \"singularity\" imminent? Through readings in psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science, we compare brains and computers, their relative strengths and weaknesses, and the prospects for human-level artificial intelligence. Topics include language, vision, game-playing, robotics, common-sense reasoning, and computational creativity. GARY MARCUS, Professor of Psychology and Director of the NYU Center for Child Language, is a cognitive scientist interested in the origins and nature of human mental life. His books include The Birth of the Mind: How a Tiny Number of Genes Creates the Complexity of Human Thought; The Norton Psychology Reader; and Kluge: The Haphazard Evolution of the Human Mind .  New Worlds, Old Worlds: Travelers and Pilgrims in Renaissance Europe and the Americas FRSEM-UA 533; class # 19001 Instructor: Jane Tylus Monday, 11:00 a.m.\u20131:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 11:00 a.m.\u2013noon Note: conflicts with Introductory Experimental Physics I (Monday 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.) Renaissance men\u2014and women\u2014found themselves at the intersection of colliding ideas about the worlds they lived in. They both looked back to antiquity and the Bible, and ahead to new and unpredictable changes regarding religion, geography, and science. The literature of travel in the period bears witness to the instability and excitement of the centuries that bear the hallmarks of the \u201cearly modern.\u201d Travelers included pilgrims and knights going off on crusade and missionaries going off to convert, as well as explorers, merchants, and inevitably, exiles. If pilgrimage was about the return to a \u201ccenter\u201d\u2014Jerusalem most prominently, but also Rome\u2014 exploration meant voyaging to an unknown periphery, and exilic wandering meant heading toward a new and uncertain home. We explore the period from roughly 1300 to 1700 through travel literature ranging from pilgrimage accounts to Columbus\u2019s letters to an epic about the first Crusade. We also look at such alternate accounts as the Aztec version of the conquista and Arabic responses to the Crusades. The course includes visiting at least one museum in New York and studying cartographic images at the New York Public Library. Students produce collaborative in-class presentations as well as a final paper exploring their own personal journey through the new and old worlds they encountered during their first semester of college. JANE TYLUS is Professor of Italian Studies and Comparative Literature at NYU, as well as faculty director of the Humanities Initiative. Prior to coming to NYU in 2003 she taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While her research focus of late has been on Italian women writers\u2014she is the award-winning author of Reclaiming Catherine of Siena: Literature, Literacy, and the Signs of Others and translator of the poetry of Gaspara Stampa and Lucrezia Tornabuoni\u2014she is really a comparatist at heart, and her favorite courses are on the \"great books\" of world literature. Her current projects are books on the beautiful Tuscan hill-town of Siena and on medieval and early modern pilgrimage. On Being Human FRSEM-UA 534; class # 19002 Instructors: G. Gabrielle Starr &amp; Jane Tylus Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u2013noon Required cohort meeting: Friday, 12:30\u20131:30 p.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) and with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) The sciences are united by their method of inquiry into the natural world and the social sciences in their study of human behavior, but the humanities seem different \u2014rich, heterogeneous, or perhaps even fragmented. Different or not, the humanities offer unique and powerful models that help us think about and understand the world we inhabit. We study ideas that have been foci of humanist inquiry from the ancient world to the present, and engage these ideas to show what humanist thought has to contribute to some big questions about human life. These ideas include simile (with a focus on pain, trauma, and the medical humanities), evidence (digital humanities, archives, and jurisprudence), dialogue (music, drama), empathy (history and philosophy), and ekphrasis (art history and literature). The course features site visits to the places where humanist engagement matters (hospitals, archives, museums, and even law courts) and encourages students to reflect upon their possible career paths as well as the connections among different disciplines, eras, and methodologies. Finally, the course considers why New York City and NYU are crucial for the humanities in the twenty-first century, in light of the City\u2019s diverse nature and NYU\u2019s identity as a global university. G. GABRIELLE STARR is Professor of English and Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science. She has published widely on eighteenth-century British literature and the history of the aesthetic. With collaborators in NYU\u2019s Center for Neural Science she has pursued research in the field of neuroaesthetics and published the results in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience .

Spring 2014 Cataclysm and Voice in the Twentieth-Century Novel FRSEM-UA 535; class # 15225 Instructor: Leeore Schnairsohn Tuesday, 3:30-6:00 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Friday, 11:00 a.m.-noon Note: conflicts with General Chemistry I recitations (Friday, 8:00 a.m.\u20131:45 p.m.) and with Advanced Chemistry I recitation (Friday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m.). The course examines how novelists of the twentieth century responded to the cataclysms, both conceptual and historical, of that slippery and multifarious period of time. At the century's opening, people were trying to get a grip on things like airplanes and telephones and relativity theory and the Russian Revolution. Concurrently, artists were changing the way they made art, and kept changing it as the century continued to provoke them. We read some astounding novelists and consider their voices in conversation with the cataclysms of their times. We also write in response to the ways our world is changing at the turn of this new century, and attempt experiments with fiction and essay to construct true slivers of experience that speak from our own historical position. The class period is divided between discussion of the week's reading and a creative writing workshop. In addition to a final critical essay, students are expected to contribute one piece of creative prose (likely some form of fiction) to the workshop, and complete weekly writing assignments (some creative, some in response to the reading, some both). LEEORE SCHNAIRSOHN holds a Ph.D. in Comparative Literature from Princeton and is currently a Language Lecturer in the Expository Writing Program at NYU. His translations of the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam have appeared in Portals and Inventory ; he has also published review articles in the Slavic and East European Journal and Canadian-American Slavic Studies . He is at work on a vampire novel and a non-vampire novel.  Spring 2014 Race and Culture in Brazil FRSEM-UA 536; class # 15924 Instructor: Dylon Robbins Monday, 2:00-4:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Wednesday, 10:00\u201311:00 a.m. Note: conflicts with Principles of Biology I (Monday and Wednesday 9:30\u201310:45 a.m.) Brazil is often invoked in conversations about race and culture. Whether as an example of presumably more egalitarian race relations, or as a regional culture embodying an exceptional fusion of African, Indigenous, and European elements, Brazil is a model for understanding heterogeneity and difference. And yet it is also a nation frequently cited for its incidence of violence and extreme economic inequality. We explore some of the unique contradictions shaping Brazilian reality as related to notions of race and culture by tracing the history of race relations in the ongoing transformation of Brazilian culture, examining such key examples and events as slavery and the plantation economy, popular music, Carnival, populism, racial democracy, affirmative action, and urban and rural violence. How do race and culture coincide and diverge in Brazil? And what may we gather about these convergences and divergences from textual, musical, and cinematic examples? DYLON ROBBINS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. He teaches courses on Brazil and the Caribbean, with particular interest in the cultural and theoretical production of these regions, in addition to that of the African Diasporas in general, with particular concern for intellectual and cultural histories, media, cinema, and popular music. His work is supported by archival research in Brazil as a Fulbright-Hays fellow at the Cinemateca Brasileira and the Instituto de Estudos Brasileiros, and in Cuba at the ICAIC, the Biblioteca Nacional, and Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas. He is currently completing his book manuscript on popular music and political subjectivity in Brazil.  Spring 2014 Lincoln in Time: Private and Public Transformations   FRSEM-UA 537; class # 16575 Instructor: Philip Kunhardt    syllabus Thursday, 11:00 a.m.-1:30 p.m. Required cohort meeting: Tuesday 2:00-3:00 p.m.   This seminar engages students in an exploration of Abraham Lincoln's  transformative leadership, a touchstone for all subsequent American  presidencies. We closely explore the personal Lincoln, always in the  context of his times and their challenges, and see how a series of  wrenching personal crises sorely tested but also helped forge Lincoln's  character. Through the study of key texts, through intensive group  discussion, and through written and spoken communication, the seminar  presents students with a series of questions: Is there a moral realm with  which human actors engage for good or ill? How do private decisions and  inner resolves impact unfolding events? And how do figures like Lincoln  manage to grow past limitations of viewpoint and errors of judgment to  embrace universal human values and commitments?  We examine Lincoln's role in the Civil War, his use of political rhetoric,  and his impact upon American civil liberties. How did the issues of  slavery and race intersect with his development as a public figure? How  was he influenced by other figures around him-southerners, abolitionists,  former slaves, politicians? And how did he learn to use words so  effectively to help produce social transformation? Concurrent with a close  study of Lincoln's written and spoken words, and of the political, social,  and interpersonal context of his times, students also wrestle with the  vital question of how they can construct their own lives.     PHILIP KUNHARDT is Distinguished Scholar in Residence in the Humanities,  and teaches history and biography in the College of Arts and Science. He  focuses on the lives of transformative figures and has co-authored five  books, including Looking for Lincoln, The American President, and P.T.  Barnum: America's Greatest Showman. He was also writer and co-producer of  more than a dozen documentary films for PBS, ABC, HBO, Discovery, and  others, including the ten-part PBS series The American President, and the  sixteen part Freedom: A History of US.  Before coming to NYU he was a Bard Center Fellow at Bard College in  Annandale, New York.  Spring 2014 Pirates, Privateers and Other Maritime Renegades of the Caribbean FRSEM-UA 538; class # 16278 Instructor: Edgardo Morales  syllabus Tuesday, 9:30 a.m.-12:00 p.m. Pirates, privateers and runaways of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth century Caribbean fought, stole, lied and killed in order to make a living and either to collaborate with or oppose bosses and empires. Today, the Jolly Roger --the pirate flag-- is clearly displayed in toys and makes for compelling cinematic moments. In real life, however, flying that flag was a criminal act punishable with the death penalty. How must we think of Francis Drake, the most feared privateer of the 1500s, in the age of Jack Sparrow, the most renown of the fantasy pirates of our days? This class will approach the history of maritime renegades as an opportunity to develop historical research and writing skills, and to help us think critically about topics that might otherwise escape scholarly inquiry. While outsiders often described pirates and privateers as renegades, godless,   murderers and villains, privateer men like Francis Drake,   pirate women like Anne Bonny, or runaway slaves like Tom King lived at   the very center of important political questions of their age. Students will read academic books such as Villains of All Nations , by the historian Marcus Rediker, as well as original documents dating back to the age of piracy. Prof. EDGARDO PEREZ MORALES graduated with a Ph.D in history from the University of Michigan. He has conducted research on privateers during the Age of Revolutions in archives and libraries in Colombia, Cuba, France, Jamaica, Spain and the United States. He teaches at NYU\u2019s Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.                        Welcome!

American Society                 December 15, 2014                                                   Dear NYU Silver Community:   Our school community, like communities across the United States, has been deeply touched in response to the Staten Island and Ferguson, Missouri, grand jury decisions announced over the past week. The tragedy of these situations is profound. An unarmed African American youth and man were killed by police. This is a pattern that has happened time and again in the United States. Many of us are angry, frustrated, and disappointed in the grand juries\u2019 decisions. The outrage that the protesters have expressed is in direct response to long-standing institutional racism and inequalities in education, employment, housing, incarceration, and health care in American society. As examples, more than 38 percent of African American and 35 percent of Hispanic children live in poverty, and African American teenagers are 21 times more likely than white teens to be killed by police.   At the Silver School of Social Work, we believe in and advocate for social justice. That includes an equitable distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges for all in society. For too many people of color and others in marginalized groups, social justice is and historically has been elusive.   In these moments, we believe it is important to join with others in our community to express our concerns and our ideas, to make sense of the complex and varying responses, and to learn from these events. The Silver School has sponsored forums for discussion and insight about these events. Students, faculty, and staff have joined the larger New York community in demonstrations protesting the injustice that these events reveal. Instructors have made time to discuss the events and our responses in class. The conversations have at times been difficult, both in the forums and sometimes in smaller conversations that have followed them. As NYU President John Sexton has stated:   \u2028 That is as it should be at a university. Some of that dialogue will be fervent, some challenging, some uncomfortable; however, we should commit ourselves to undertaking that discourse with respect and in accordance with our highest traditions, viewing even the toughest exchange as an opportunity to listen and to learn from one another. Let us conduct ourselves in a way that might afford the Brown and Garner families some solace and some hope that their terrible losses may lead to a better, more inclusive ideal of justice and peace. (The Quest for Justice, Letter to the NYU Community, Dec. 4, 2014)   These events have touched us deeply, empowering many, and raising concerns for others. Concerns include our openness to different points of view, and painful questions of social justice within our own community. Many of us are asking ourselves, what lasting good can we take away from these discussions? And, how can we make a true difference that will bring social justice to our society and to the world? As we reflect on our own conversations over the past weeks, here are some of our thoughts about how we can make a lasting difference in increasing social justice in our world.     Be an agent for change. Advocate for stronger community police partnerships designed to build trust, accountability, and mutual respect. Take the time to learn about elected candidates\u2019 positions on social justice issues and vote for the most progressive candidates. Work with and on behalf of marginalized communities.   The dialog is very important. Keep talking and listening to each other. This requires respect for different points of view and dedication to helping ourselves and others to develop deeper insight about social justice in our school, University, city, country, and the world.   The environmental adage, \u201cthink globally; act locally,\u201d has a lot of meaning for social justice concerns. As in politics, we can have the most immediate impact in our local community. This means advocating for progressive local change and dedicating ourselves to hold a high level of respect and social justice in our everyday interactions with students, faculty, and professional colleagues. Set high standards for how you treat others in your world. Put your ideals into action. Listen and reflect when others give you feedback that you are falling short of your standards.   Because we are students and educators, it is our responsibility to keep examining and learning. Keep reading and talking and learning more. To support a personal commitment to continual learning and self-examination, we have started a list of some of the best articles that we have read since the grand juries\u2019 decisions.     Please add your voice to our school\u2019s statement, by adding your comments below and by sharing the most insightful and useful materials that you have read on this current crisis.
