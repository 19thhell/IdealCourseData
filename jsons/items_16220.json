It was started in Spring 2002 by Gideon D'Arcangelo and has developed and changed with the times.     Current Instructor Greg Shakar (greg.shakar &lt;at&gt; nyu)   Previous Instructors Gideon D'Arcangelo (gideon &lt;at&gt; nyu &lt;dot&gt; edu), Jamie Allen (jamie &lt;at&gt; nyu &lt;dot&gt; edu) and Hans-Christoph Steiner (hansi &lt;at&gt; nyu &lt;dot&gt; edu)      Course Description   Electronic music is usually played with a keyboard and mouse. Laptop musicians often sit at a desk and give performances that feel like watching someone work in their cubicle. The idea behind NIME is to go beyond the mouse and keyboard and beyond even piano keys and drum pads. It seeks to present performance systems that make the most out of the new opportunities for musical expression afforded by interactive technologies.    The course will focus on the design and creation of electronic musical instruments. Music in performance is the primary subject of this class. We will approach questions such as \"What is performance?\", \"What makes a musical interface intuitive and emotionally immediate?\" and \"How do we create meaningful correlations between performance gestures and their musical consequences?\" Over the semester, we will look at many examples of current work by creators of musical interfaces, and discuss a wide range of issues facing technology-enabled performance. Readings and case studies will provide background for class discussions on the theory and practice of designing gestural controllers for musical performance.    Students will invent and prototype a musical instrument - a complete system encompassing musical controller, system for mapping input to sound, and the sound output itself. Students will focus on composition and performance techniques as they prepare their instruments for a live concert. The class will culminate in a musical performance where students will play their instruments. Students are also permitted to invite other performers to join them on stage.
