While the struggle for civil rights began early in American history, the course mostly focuses on the black Civil Rights movement with an emphasis on the period from 1954 through 1966. By focusing on this time period, which was reported and chronicled by the television/film media, the course covers different perspectives as well as provides insights about both the subject matter contained in the films and the techniques and skills of good documentary filmmaking. Through weekly screenings of films, class discussions, and invited guest speakers, students learn about the evolution of the documentary genre as a means of better understanding history, and students gain knowledge about the historical/political/cultural milestones and the heroes of the movement.
