As part of the class, you will write 4 papers reflecting on what you have learned during the program and focusing on important areas of international business, finance and globalization. The course has two objectives/learning goals:          Students will analyze some of the most important global challenges facing the United States and world. Classroom discussions each week will focus on different challenges facing the world today, with a focus on current economic and business issues. For example, students will discuss the causes and implications for business of the current global financial crisis, the impact of immigration and outsourcing, the economic and political implications of the rise of China, the impact and extent of globalization, future global demographic challenges (e.g. aging and pension funding) and problems in managing the environment. Readings and discussions will illustrate the nature of these problems with an eye toward potential solutions.          Second, an important additional goal of the course is to sharpen students&rsquo; writing skills. Consistent feedback from alumni and graduating seniors has been that students have received insufficient opportunities to write individual assignments during their studies. This ability to write clearly, logically and persuasively is a critical skill for your future and the seminar will help you hone your writing ability.

Assessment Components      Course Requirements          The course requirements include class participation and the preparation of 3 short papers Given the seminar format of the course, this classwill require your active participation every week. Doing the assigned readings and being prepared to contribute in class will, therefore, be an important part of your grade. Please also feel free to come to our meetings with questions, comments and topics that will generate interesting discussions. Separately, each student should also be prepared to serve as a discussion leader for those weeks where they will be writing a paper on the issue area at hand          As well as being based on participation in class discussions, participation will be based on contributions to the class discussion boards on our Blackboard Site. Discussion boards will be set up for articles and cases. Idea contributions in the form of postings on these discussion boards each week are required. The hope is that when we can come to class, we will already have in mind the controversies and questions that the various books and articles generate.                Grading Guidelines          Class Participation and Attendance            20%     Paper #1 Reflection Paper (due 9/27)         25%     Paper #2 Issue Paper 1 (due 10/25)            25%     Paper #3 Issue Paper 2 (due 11/29)            30%                Assignments          Assignment #1   Reflection on what you have learned over the course of WST.

Suggested length is 5-6 pages for each paper.         Grading      At NYU Stern we seek to teach challenging courses that allow students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. In general, students in undergraduate core courses can expect a grading distribution where:              25-35% of students can expect to receive A&rsquo;s for excellent work         50-70% of students can expect to receive B&rsquo;s for good or very good work           5-15% of students can expect to receive C&rsquo;s or less for adequate or below work          Note that while the School uses these ranges as a guide, the actual distribution for this course and your own grade will depend upon how well you actually perform in this course.         Re-Grading     The process of assigning grades is intended to be one of unbiased evaluation. Students are encouraged to respect the integrity and authority of the professor&rsquo;s grading system and are discouraged from pursuing arbitrary challenges to it.     If you believe an inadvertent error has been made in the grading of an individual assignment or in assessing an overall course grade, a request to have the grade re-evaluated may be submitted. You must submit such requests in writing to me including a brief written statement of why you believe that an error in grading has been made.          Professional Responsibilities For This Course       Attendance                  Class attendance is essential to your success in this course and is part of your grade. An excused absence can only be granted in cases of serious illness, grave family emergencies, or religious observance and must be documented. Job interviews and incompatible travel plans are considered unexcused absences. Where possible, please notify me in advance of an excused absence.           Participation        In-class contribution is a significant part of your grade and an important part of our shared learning experience. Your active participation helps me to evaluate your overall performance.   You can excel in this area if you come to class on time and contribute to the course by:            Providing strong evidence of having thought through the material.        Advancing the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.        Listening attentively in class.        Demonstrating interest in your peers' comments, questions, and presentations.        Giving constructive feedback to your peers when appropriate.              Assignments                Late assignments will either not be accepted or will incur a grade penalty unless due to documented serious illness or family emergency. Exceptions to this policy for reasons of religious observance or civic obligation will only be made available when the assignment cannot reasonably be completed prior to the due date and you make arrangements for late submission in advance.           Classroom Norms                  Arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early is unprofessional and disruptive to the entire class. Repeated tardiness will have an impact on your grade.         Turn off all electronic devices prior to the start of class. Laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction to everyone.            Stern Policies       General Behavior    The School expects that students will conduct themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty, students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the classroom.        Collaboration on Graded Assignments    Students may not work together on graded assignment unless the instructor gives express permission.        Course Evaluations    Course evaluations are important to us and to students who come after you. Please complete them thoughtfully.         Academic Integrity      Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we do here at NYU Stern. As members of our community, all students agree to abide by the NYU Stern Student Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to:              Exercise integrity in all aspects of one&#39;s academic work including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.         Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as one&rsquo;s own. Ideas, data, direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation of the work of others should be fully referenced.         Refrain from behaving in ways that knowingly support, assist, or in any way attempt to enable another person to engage in any violation of the Code of Conduct. Our support also includes reporting any observed violations of this Code of Conduct or other School and University policies that are deemed to adversely affect the NYU Stern community.            The entire Stern Student Code of Conduct applies to all students enrolled in Stern courses and can be found here:       Undergraduate College: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/uc/codeofconduct     Graduate Programs: http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/studentactivities/involved.cfm?doc_id=102505       To help ensure the integrity of our learning community, prose assignments you submit to Blackboard will be submitted to Turnitin. Turnitin will compare your submission to a database of prior submissions to Turnitin, current and archived Web pages, periodicals, journals, and publications. Additionally, your document will become part of the Turnitin database.         Recording of Classes      Your class may be recorded for educational purposes           Students with Disabilities      If you have a qualified disability and will require academic accommodation of any kind during this course, you must notify me at the beginning of the course and provide a letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD, 998-4980, www.nyu.edu/csd ) verifying your registration and outlining the accommodations they recommend.

Assessment Components      Course Requirements          The course requirements include class participation and the preparation of 3 short papers Given the seminar format of the course, this classwill require your active participation every week. Doing the assigned readings and being prepared to contribute in class will, therefore, be an important part of your grade. Please also feel free to come to our meetings with questions, comments and topics that will generate interesting discussions. Separately, each student should also be prepared to serve as a discussion leader for those weeks where they will be writing a paper on the issue area at hand          As well as being based on participation in class discussions, participation will be based on contributions to the class discussion boards on our Blackboard Site. Discussion boards will be set up for articles and cases. Idea contributions in the form of postings on these discussion boards each week are required. The hope is that when we can come to class, we will already have in mind the controversies and questions that the various books and articles generate.                Grading Guidelines          Class Participation and Attendance            20%     Paper #1 Reflection Paper (due 9/27)         25%     Paper #2 Issue Paper 1 (due 10/25)            25%     Paper #3 Issue Paper 2 (due 11/29)            30%                Assignments          Assignment #1   Reflection on what you have learned over the course of WST.

Suggested length is 5-6 pages for each paper.         Grading      At NYU Stern we seek to teach challenging courses that allow students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. In general, students in undergraduate core courses can expect a grading distribution where:              25-35% of students can expect to receive A&rsquo;s for excellent work         50-70% of students can expect to receive B&rsquo;s for good or very good work           5-15% of students can expect to receive C&rsquo;s or less for adequate or below work          Note that while the School uses these ranges as a guide, the actual distribution for this course and your own grade will depend upon how well you actually perform in this course.         Re-Grading     The process of assigning grades is intended to be one of unbiased evaluation. Students are encouraged to respect the integrity and authority of the professor&rsquo;s grading system and are discouraged from pursuing arbitrary challenges to it.     If you believe an inadvertent error has been made in the grading of an individual assignment or in assessing an overall course grade, a request to have the grade re-evaluated may be submitted. You must submit such requests in writing to me including a brief written statement of why you believe that an error in grading has been made.          Professional Responsibilities For This Course       Attendance                  Class attendance is essential to your success in this course and is part of your grade. An excused absence can only be granted in cases of serious illness, grave family emergencies, or religious observance and must be documented. Job interviews and incompatible travel plans are considered unexcused absences. Where possible, please notify me in advance of an excused absence.           Participation        In-class contribution is a significant part of your grade and an important part of our shared learning experience. Your active participation helps me to evaluate your overall performance.   You can excel in this area if you come to class on time and contribute to the course by:            Providing strong evidence of having thought through the material.        Advancing the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.        Listening attentively in class.        Demonstrating interest in your peers' comments, questions, and presentations.        Giving constructive feedback to your peers when appropriate.              Assignments                Late assignments will either not be accepted or will incur a grade penalty unless due to documented serious illness or family emergency. Exceptions to this policy for reasons of religious observance or civic obligation will only be made available when the assignment cannot reasonably be completed prior to the due date and you make arrangements for late submission in advance.           Classroom Norms                  Arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early is unprofessional and disruptive to the entire class. Repeated tardiness will have an impact on your grade.         Turn off all electronic devices prior to the start of class. Laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction to everyone.            Stern Policies       General Behavior    The School expects that students will conduct themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty, students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the classroom.        Collaboration on Graded Assignments    Students may not work together on graded assignment unless the instructor gives express permission.        Course Evaluations    Course evaluations are important to us and to students who come after you. Please complete them thoughtfully.         Academic Integrity      Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we do here at NYU Stern. As members of our community, all students agree to abide by the NYU Stern Student Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to:              Exercise integrity in all aspects of one&#39;s academic work including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.         Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as one&rsquo;s own. Ideas, data, direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation of the work of others should be fully referenced.         Refrain from behaving in ways that knowingly support, assist, or in any way attempt to enable another person to engage in any violation of the Code of Conduct. Our support also includes reporting any observed violations of this Code of Conduct or other School and University policies that are deemed to adversely affect the NYU Stern community.            The entire Stern Student Code of Conduct applies to all students enrolled in Stern courses and can be found here:       Undergraduate College: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/uc/codeofconduct     Graduate Programs: http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/studentactivities/involved.cfm?doc_id=102505       To help ensure the integrity of our learning community, prose assignments you submit to Blackboard will be submitted to Turnitin. Turnitin will compare your submission to a database of prior submissions to Turnitin, current and archived Web pages, periodicals, journals, and publications. Additionally, your document will become part of the Turnitin database.         Recording of Classes      Your class may be recorded for educational purposes           Students with Disabilities      If you have a qualified disability and will require academic accommodation of any kind during this course, you must notify me at the beginning of the course and provide a letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD, 998-4980, www.nyu.edu/csd ) verifying your registration and outlining the accommodations they recommend. If you will need to take an exam at the CSD, you must submit a completed Exam Accommodations Form to them at least one week prior to the scheduled exam time to be guaranteed accommodation."}, {"content": "Course Syllabi                     PLEASE NOTE:  Sample syllabi are posted to provide you with additional information for the course registration process and may not reflect the final versions of the courses.

As part of the class, you will write 4 papers reflecting on what you have learned during the program and focusing on important areas of international business, finance and globalization. The course has two objectives/learning goals:          Students will analyze some of the most important global challenges facing the United States and world. Classroom discussions each week will focus on different challenges facing the world today, with a focus on current economic and business issues. For example, students will discuss the causes and implications for business of the current global financial crisis, the impact of immigration and outsourcing, the economic and political implications of the rise of China, the impact and extent of globalization, future global demographic challenges (e.g. aging and pension funding) and problems in managing the environment. Readings and discussions will illustrate the nature of these problems with an eye toward potential solutions.          Second, an important additional goal of the course is to sharpen students&rsquo; writing skills. Consistent feedback from alumni and graduating seniors has been that students have received insufficient opportunities to write individual assignments during their studies. This ability to write clearly, logically and persuasively is a critical skill for your future and the seminar will help you hone your writing ability.

Assessment Components      Course Requirements          The course requirements include class participation and the preparation of 3 short papers Given the seminar format of the course, this classwill require your active participation every week. Doing the assigned readings and being prepared to contribute in class will, therefore, be an important part of your grade. Please also feel free to come to our meetings with questions, comments and topics that will generate interesting discussions. Separately, each student should also be prepared to serve as a discussion leader for those weeks where they will be writing a paper on the issue area at hand          As well as being based on participation in class discussions, participation will be based on contributions to the class discussion boards on our Blackboard Site. Discussion boards will be set up for articles and cases. Idea contributions in the form of postings on these discussion boards each week are required. The hope is that when we can come to class, we will already have in mind the controversies and questions that the various books and articles generate.                Grading Guidelines          Class Participation and Attendance            20%     Paper #1 Reflection Paper (due 9/27)         25%     Paper #2 Issue Paper 1 (due 10/25)            25%     Paper #3 Issue Paper 2 (due 11/29)            30%                Assignments          Assignment #1   Reflection on what you have learned over the course of WST. The focus is on the time spent abroad and the impact it has had on your maturity, interests, career goals and outlook on world. Suggested length is 5 pages.                   (See attached assignment detail.)          Assignments #2-3    Reaction papers responding to the topics of throughout the semester.

Suggested length is 5-6 pages for each paper.         Grading      At NYU Stern we seek to teach challenging courses that allow students to demonstrate their mastery of the subject matter. In general, students in undergraduate core courses can expect a grading distribution where:              25-35% of students can expect to receive A&rsquo;s for excellent work         50-70% of students can expect to receive B&rsquo;s for good or very good work           5-15% of students can expect to receive C&rsquo;s or less for adequate or below work          Note that while the School uses these ranges as a guide, the actual distribution for this course and your own grade will depend upon how well you actually perform in this course.         Re-Grading     The process of assigning grades is intended to be one of unbiased evaluation. Students are encouraged to respect the integrity and authority of the professor&rsquo;s grading system and are discouraged from pursuing arbitrary challenges to it.     If you believe an inadvertent error has been made in the grading of an individual assignment or in assessing an overall course grade, a request to have the grade re-evaluated may be submitted. You must submit such requests in writing to me including a brief written statement of why you believe that an error in grading has been made.          Professional Responsibilities For This Course       Attendance                  Class attendance is essential to your success in this course and is part of your grade. An excused absence can only be granted in cases of serious illness, grave family emergencies, or religious observance and must be documented. Job interviews and incompatible travel plans are considered unexcused absences. Where possible, please notify me in advance of an excused absence.           Participation        In-class contribution is a significant part of your grade and an important part of our shared learning experience. Your active participation helps me to evaluate your overall performance.   You can excel in this area if you come to class on time and contribute to the course by:            Providing strong evidence of having thought through the material.        Advancing the discussion by contributing insightful comments and questions.        Listening attentively in class.        Demonstrating interest in your peers' comments, questions, and presentations.        Giving constructive feedback to your peers when appropriate.              Assignments                Late assignments will either not be accepted or will incur a grade penalty unless due to documented serious illness or family emergency. Exceptions to this policy for reasons of religious observance or civic obligation will only be made available when the assignment cannot reasonably be completed prior to the due date and you make arrangements for late submission in advance.           Classroom Norms                  Arrive to class on time and stay to the end of the class period. Chronically arriving late or leaving class early is unprofessional and disruptive to the entire class. Repeated tardiness will have an impact on your grade.         Turn off all electronic devices prior to the start of class. Laptops, cell phones and other electronic devices are a distraction to everyone.            Stern Policies       General Behavior    The School expects that students will conduct themselves with respect and professionalism toward faculty, students, and others present in class and will follow the rules laid down by the instructor for classroom behavior. Students who fail to do so may be asked to leave the classroom.        Collaboration on Graded Assignments    Students may not work together on graded assignment unless the instructor gives express permission.        Course Evaluations    Course evaluations are important to us and to students who come after you. Please complete them thoughtfully.         Academic Integrity      Integrity is critical to the learning process and to all that we do here at NYU Stern. As members of our community, all students agree to abide by the NYU Stern Student Code of Conduct, which includes a commitment to:              Exercise integrity in all aspects of one&#39;s academic work including, but not limited to, the preparation and completion of exams, papers and all other course requirements by not engaging in any method or means that provides an unfair advantage.         Clearly acknowledge the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as one&rsquo;s own. Ideas, data, direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), paraphrasing, creative expression, or any other incorporation of the work of others should be fully referenced.         Refrain from behaving in ways that knowingly support, assist, or in any way attempt to enable another person to engage in any violation of the Code of Conduct. Our support also includes reporting any observed violations of this Code of Conduct or other School and University policies that are deemed to adversely affect the NYU Stern community.            The entire Stern Student Code of Conduct applies to all students enrolled in Stern courses and can be found here:       Undergraduate College: http://www.stern.nyu.edu/uc/codeofconduct     Graduate Programs: http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/studentactivities/involved.cfm?doc_id=102505       To help ensure the integrity of our learning community, prose assignments you submit to Blackboard will be submitted to Turnitin. Turnitin will compare your submission to a database of prior submissions to Turnitin, current and archived Web pages, periodicals, journals, and publications. Additionally, your document will become part of the Turnitin database.         Recording of Classes      Your class may be recorded for educational purposes           Students with Disabilities      If you have a qualified disability and will require academic accommodation of any kind during this course, you must notify me at the beginning of the course and provide a letter from the Moses Center for Students with Disabilities (CSD, 998-4980, www.nyu.edu/csd ) verifying your registration and outlining the accommodations they recommend. If you will need to take an exam at the CSD, you must submit a completed Exam Accommodations Form to them at least one week prior to the scheduled exam time to be guaranteed accommodation."}, {"content": "Course Syllabi                     PLEASE NOTE:  Sample syllabi are posted to provide you with additional information for the course registration process and may not reflect the final versions of the courses.
