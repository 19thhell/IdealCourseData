During the first three weeks of each semester, a &quot;room freeze&quot; is in effect. This period allows for the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services to take an inventory of occupancy and vacancies. During this time, students may submit room change requests, however changes will not begin until the freeze is over.   Different types of room changes are possible depending on the individual student's needs. Each student requesting a room change may meet with his/her Residence Hall Director to discuss options, needs and determine the best course of action.   Please note that housing rates are different from building to building, and related to room type within a building. Also, some buildings may require enrollment in a meal plan. Details and housing rates can be found here .   The Spring 2015 Room Change process has now ended.     Bed-for-Bed Exchange Forum    In an effort to explore all possible opportunities, we have designed a new process that we are hopeful may result in some successful \u201cbed-for-bed\u201d room exchanges. This process is intended to provide you a forum to \u201cswap\u201d spaces with another student. By checking the box within the Bed-for-Bed Room Exchange section of the Housing Portal, you authorize the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services to share your contact information (email address, building location and type of room accommodation) with all other students interested in considering a bed-for-bed room change.   The bed-for-bed participant list will be distributed to interested parties on a weekly basis. Every Monday at 12pm, a PDF of the participant list will be emailed to students who have opted into the process. To opt into or out of the process you can check or uncheck the box within the Bed-for-Bed Room Exchange section of the Housing Portal at any time. Only those students who have opted into to process by Mondays at 9am will be included in the weekly participant list.   Spring 2015 Bed For Bed:     The Bed for Bed Forum will begin after check-in, January 26, 2015 for students with confirmed Spring 2015 housing.   Click here for Bed-for-Bed instructions.

Leave of Absence   NYU expects its students to maintain continuous registration in an academic program with the exception of summer breaks.

Date change requests must be received at least seven (7) days prior to the beginning of the earliest week that is being added or removed from the existing reservation.     Billing is based on a Sunday to Saturday schedule. Weeks cannot be prorated if you do not arrive on a Sunday or leave prior to a Saturday.     Date changes are processed according to the date received.     All date changes processed after May 1, 2015 will be assessed a $35 processing fee .     All requests to reduce a reservation (and have charges removed for those weeks) must be submitted at least one full week prior to the earliest week being removed from the reservation. Failure to provide at least one week's notice will result in the resident being charged in full for that week.     All requests to extend a reservation are subject to availability and approved requests require the resident to remit full payment for the additional weeks being added to the reservation as well as the $35 processing fee within one week of the change.     2015 Date Change Request Form      For all date changes, please note the following:     There will be no extensions beyond Saturday, August 15, 2015 except for matriculated NYU students transitioning to a confirmed Fall 2015 NYU Housing assignment in New York City.     Checking out of the residence hall prior to the scheduled departure date does not constitute official notification of a change in departure date. All such requests must be made following the procedures described here.

During the first three weeks of each semester, a &quot;room freeze&quot; is in effect. This period allows for the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services to take an inventory of occupancy and vacancies. During this time, students may submit room change requests, however changes will not begin until the freeze is over.   Different types of room changes are possible depending on the individual student's needs. Each student requesting a room change may meet with his/her Residence Hall Director to discuss options, needs and determine the best course of action.   Please note that housing rates are different from building to building, and related to room type within a building. Also, some buildings may require enrollment in a meal plan. Details and housing rates can be found here .   The Spring 2015 Room Change process has now ended.     Bed-for-Bed Exchange Forum    In an effort to explore all possible opportunities, we have designed a new process that we are hopeful may result in some successful \u201cbed-for-bed\u201d room exchanges. This process is intended to provide you a forum to \u201cswap\u201d spaces with another student. By checking the box within the Bed-for-Bed Room Exchange section of the Housing Portal, you authorize the Office of Residential Life and Housing Services to share your contact information (email address, building location and type of room accommodation) with all other students interested in considering a bed-for-bed room change.   The bed-for-bed participant list will be distributed to interested parties on a weekly basis. Every Monday at 12pm, a PDF of the participant list will be emailed to students who have opted into the process. To opt into or out of the process you can check or uncheck the box within the Bed-for-Bed Room Exchange section of the Housing Portal at any time. Only those students who have opted into to process by Mondays at 9am will be included in the weekly participant list.   Spring 2015 Bed For Bed:     The Bed for Bed Forum will begin after check-in, January 26, 2015 for students with confirmed Spring 2015 housing.   Click here for Bed-for-Bed instructions.        Cancellations   Cancellations after the final deadline date are accepted only for specific reasons as outlined in the Housing License. The NYU Housing License is a commitment for both the Fall and Spring terms. Please note the following housing cancellation deadlines:   Spring 2015 Residents:       School-approved cancellations (eg. withdrawals, deferrals, and leaves of absence) received after December 12, 2014 will be charged a $1000.00 cancellation fee.     Academic Year 2015-2016 Applicants:   Fall 2015 Returning Undergraduate Students     Cancellations received by May 15, 2015 will be charged a $500.00 cancellation fee.     Cancellations received between May 16, 2015 and June 12, 2015 will be charged a $750.00 cancellation fee.   School-approved cancellations (eg. withdrawals, deferrals, and leaves of absence) received after June 12, 2015 will be charged a $1000.00 cancellation fee.     Fall 2015 New Undergraduate Students and Non-Renewable Undergraduate &amp; Graduate Students     Cancellations must be received by June 12, 2015.   School-approved cancellations (eg. withdrawals, deferrals, and leaves of absence) received after June 12, 2015 will be charged a $1000.00 cancellation fee.       The following are the allowable reasons to cancel housing beyond the published deadline:   Withdrawal   A student who officially withdraws from the University will not be permitted to remain in housing. Housing charges will be incurred up to the point of check-out, and a $1,000 cancellation fee will be applied.   December Graduation   Students graduating in December may cancel their housing for the Spring term, and are expected to check-out of their Fall 2014 housing assignments within 24 hours of completing their last final exam, or by Noon on Friday, December 19, 2014, whichever comes first.     Leave of Absence   NYU expects its students to maintain continuous registration in an academic program with the exception of summer breaks. However, at times it is necessary or desirable for a student to take a leave from enrollment for a period of time. Such leaves may be voluntary or involuntary, and will be handled in accordance with the NYU Student Leave Policy. Students must also refer to the bulletins and websites of their specific schools or visit their schools administrative offices for additional information concerning the impact of a voluntary or involuntary leave and any additional requirements for a leave of absence.   For information about the University Student Leave Policy please click here .   To cancel housing, due to an approved Leave of Absence, students must submit official documentation with their school. Housing charges will be incurred up to the point of check-out.   There are several types of Leaves of Absence, and it is important to note that not all allow a student to retain their housing guarantee.     Medical Leave - Students on Medical Leaves must receive clearance from The University Health Center before they can return to housing. Students will receive information and instructions via email about returning to housing.     Personal Leave - Students who maintain matriculation, but are not enrolled may be approved for a personal leave. Students on a Personal Leave of Absence do not maintain their renewable housing status. Please note, a $1,000 cancellation fee will be applied.   Academic Leave - Students may receive approval from their school to study at other academic institutions. They must notify the Housing Office and provide official school documentation indicating their intent to return to housing. Please note, a $1,000 cancellation fee will be applied.     Study Away   Students who have accepted admissions to a study away program do not need to complete a cancellation form. While away, students will receive information and instructions via email about returning to NYU-NY housing.   Students who are residing in NYU-NY for the Fall 2014 term and are studying away for the Spring 2015 term must check-out of their Fall 2014 housing assignment within 24 hours of completing their last final exam, or by Noon on Friday, December 19, 2014, whichever comes first.   Cancellation Request   Students must access to NYU Housing Portal to submit a cancellation request. Once in the portal, you will need to select &quot;Cancel Housing&quot; in the top menu bar.             Petition for Release   If your need to cancel your housing and do not meet the criteria itemized under cancellations, you may petition for special consideration. The petition information and petition form are in pdf format.   Download the PDF           Other Forms   Meal Plan Change/Add Form     This form is available online via NYUHome &gt; Housing Forms Log-In Channel.

Date change requests must be received at least seven (7) days prior to the beginning of the earliest week that is being added or removed from the existing reservation.     Billing is based on a Sunday to Saturday schedule. Weeks cannot be prorated if you do not arrive on a Sunday or leave prior to a Saturday.     Date changes are processed according to the date received.     All date changes processed after May 1, 2015 will be assessed a $35 processing fee .     All requests to reduce a reservation (and have charges removed for those weeks) must be submitted at least one full week prior to the earliest week being removed from the reservation. Failure to provide at least one week's notice will result in the resident being charged in full for that week.     All requests to extend a reservation are subject to availability and approved requests require the resident to remit full payment for the additional weeks being added to the reservation as well as the $35 processing fee within one week of the change.     2015 Date Change Request Form      For all date changes, please note the following:     There will be no extensions beyond Saturday, August 15, 2015 except for matriculated NYU students transitioning to a confirmed Fall 2015 NYU Housing assignment in New York City.     Checking out of the residence hall prior to the scheduled departure date does not constitute official notification of a change in departure date. All such requests must be made following the procedures described here.     If you have requested to live with people and one person in the group changes their arrival date and the other people in the group do not, this may effect the request to be assigned to the same bedroom or suite.
