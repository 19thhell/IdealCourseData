Gulf countries have witnessed an unprecedented construction boom since the beginning of oil exploitation. New cities have been built and old cities have been renewed, often with the help of such world-class architects as Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, Walter Gropius, and Constantinos Doxiadis. In Abu Dhabi, infrastructures, public buildings, and residential projects have been designed by Roger Taillibert, Benjamin Thompson, Norman Foster, and Zaha Hadid, to name but a few. Students contribute to writing the story of modern architecture in the city. They visit and document remarkable buildings, explore local archives, and reconstitute the trajectories of architectural forms and patterns. The final project is an architectural guide designed for students, faculty, and the Abu Dhabi community.    *For NYU New York and NYU Shanghai students interested in this course, please submit the application by October 15th.

This course focuses on the formation of the modern museum. Museums of art, natural history, science, technology, and anthropology are examined from a variety of disciplinary approaches that explore the institution and its practices with respect to governance, colonialism, nationalism, class, gender, ethnicity, and community. Visits to the museums and cultural institutions in the region are an important part of this course.

The purposes, processes, and ethics of such fundamental tasks as acquisitions, conservation, installations, exhibitions, and interpretation are examined in detail with particular attention to how the work of art is perceived in its many different guises and contexts. The role of museums in our age of globalization are also be discussed. Some classes may be taught on site and individual museum visits by students may be required.

Famous is the Silk Road, but over the centuries many other regions were also connected through trade. These activities left behind various cultural traces&mdash;in buildings, landscapes, shipwrecks, traditions, and archives. These cultural footprints are now considered \"shared cultural heritage.\" Important junctions in the network are often also recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites for their universal and global value. In this course students study the basic theory of cultural heritage and explore the various perspectives on heritage. Terminology like shared, mutual, global, and contested heritage are discussed. The acquired knowledge and insights will be applied in a research assignment at a World Heritage Site, Galle in Sri Lanka.

This course considers a range of art practices and their relation to the communities in which they are produced. The professor brings the class to the Queens Museum (which he directs) to look at how an art institution can be engaged in the social issues of a community, and leads site visits to other city institutions both international and local in their focus. We also visit urban spaces transformed by art from Battery Park City to the subway lines adorned by the city&rsquo;s Arts for Transit Program. Fundamental questions addressed in the course include: How should a museum serve its audience? Should we use the same criteria to assess the success of an artwork in a gallery and on a subway platform? Which parts of New York&rsquo;s art world are transferrable to other international cities, and which are not?

It takes as its primary area of interest not works of art but other forms of visuality, such as advertising, fashion, comics and graphic novels, television, the internet, graffiti and tattooing, as well as the visual formulations of cultural, racial, and gender difference. Today, the study of visual culture is the focus of a vast body of scholarly investigation and continues to raise new questions in the wake of technological advances and a demand for visual satisfaction. This class offers an introduction to visual analysis in a world increasingly dominated by the graphic transmission of information, knowledge, and aesthetic experience.    Effective from Fall 2013, this course will satisfy the NYUAD Islamic requirement.

Considered as the true global art form of the twentieth century, conceptual art manifests itself in ideas that challenge the current sociopolitical forces of our times and the commonly held notions of what art is about. The course will examine contemporary art from the lens of conceptual art focusing on key works by international artists. Student will examine the definition/s of &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo; and the current debates around the modern and contemporary in relation to Western and non-Western art.

This course explores the consequences for art and scholarship of the recent museum boom and asks what might it take to produce a change of direction.

VISAR-AD 165J Gardens of Eden in the History of Art                                                                              The garden is one of the oldest modes of human intervention in the environment. This course explores the garden as a major art form by focusing on pictorial and spatial representations of the Garden of Eden. The Edenic Paradise of Genesis and the Qu&rsquo;ran where Adam and Eve transgressed against God gives access to thought about gardens in the ancient Middle East. As a foundational figure in Judaic, Christian, and Islamic theology, the Garden of Eden spawned a history of interpretation that helped differentiate these religions. The history of Eden in the art of the peoples of the book is closely entwined with that of garden design, and the seminar examines both. We will study gardens in ancient Mesopotamia, early Christian monasteries, Syrian and Andalusian courtyards, Renaissance altarpieces, Enlightenment cities, Persian court miniatures, Mughal tomb complexes, and early American towns. To analyze these works, the course introduces fundamental methods of art history as an academic discipline. The seminar includes field trips to gardens and collections in the UAE and India, and concludes with a collaborative garden design project in Abu Dhabi.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.    *Note: This course number has now been changed to VISAR-AD 102.

VISAR-AD 171X Modern Art of the Arab World                                                                                                               In the short period of thirty years art of the Arab world moved from the periphery of the international art world to the center of global visual art production. The course examines the systems that have prompted this change and the theoretical framework that currently situates Arab art within the global discourse on visual art. Focusing on selected artists, the course explores the impact of political, social and market forces on the region&rsquo;s art and the recent discourse on Islamic art and its links to modern and contemporary art of the region.

They introduce the methods and fundamental concepts of art history by taking one work of art and constructing around it a web of diverse objects and practices that allow us to grapple with the meanings of art and its histories within global and trans-historical perspectives. Among the questions we ask throughout the course are: What is art? What is art history? What are the institutions that shape the practice and dissemination of art? How is art affected by histories of cultural exchange? What is the nature of tradition? Visits to local museums. Lecture/discussion. Evaluation will be through written assignments, powerpoint presentations, and active class participation. No previous knowledge of art history required. This course fulfills Art and Art History requirements.    *Note this course has now been changed to VISAR-AD 104.    *There are no prerequisites for this course, but VISAR-AD 166 ( now changed to VISAR-AD 102) Foundations of Art History I is recommended.
