In addition to our joint work among media, legal, and educational innovators on this growing sector, I am now conducting fieldwork in scientific laboratories on brain research about learning, memory, childhood psychiatric diagnoses and epigenetics. Of course, kinship relations lie at the heart of our project, and we are interviewing families across a wide array of social locations who have had the experience of having a child diagnosed with special educational categories and services. We see this as a particularly promising arena for understanding unanticipated cultural activism around gender, racial-ethnic, class and kinship claims on citizenship. Our new fieldwork concerns the rise of disability consciousness. We argue for an explicitly anthropological perspective on the growing public awareness and mediated diversity of \u201cAll Kinds of Minds\u201d (to quote a famous and popular book on the subject) in U.S. families and communities. One of my contributions to this research involves intensive fieldwork at a pediatric neuroscience laboratory, where theories about childhood ADHD, Learning Disabilities, and other conditions are increasingly being folded into collaborations to produce \u201cBig Data\u201d on \u201cSmall Kids\u201d.

Just by being a parent and a student, you have already proven that nothing is unreachable, and that you have great strength and determination. Below you will find a number of resources that may be helpful to you as you balance both these roles.   NYU Family Care   NYU Family Care is working to support NYU's working parents with children aged newborn through school-age. Many of the initiatives are also available to student parents. These include access to the NYU Babysitting Registry , Nursing Mother and Lactation Rooms , Parenting Education Programs, NYU Parents Network , and school and child care options. Students may also sign-up for the Monthly Family Cares News email, which includes information about activates, events, resources, and programs available at NYU and in NYC.

In addition to our joint work among media, legal, and educational innovators on this growing sector, I am now conducting fieldwork in scientific laboratories on brain research about learning, memory, childhood psychiatric diagnoses and epigenetics. Of course, kinship relations lie at the heart of our project, and we are interviewing families across a wide array of social locations who have had the experience of having a child diagnosed with special educational categories and services. We see this as a particularly promising arena for understanding unanticipated cultural activism around gender, racial-ethnic, class and kinship claims on citizenship. Our new fieldwork concerns the rise of disability consciousness. We argue for an explicitly anthropological perspective on the growing public awareness and mediated diversity of \u201cAll Kinds of Minds\u201d (to quote a famous and popular book on the subject) in U.S. families and communities. One of my contributions to this research involves intensive fieldwork at a pediatric neuroscience laboratory, where theories about childhood ADHD, Learning Disabilities, and other conditions are increasingly being folded into collaborations to produce \u201cBig Data\u201d on \u201cSmall Kids\u201d.

As part of NYU Langone\u2019s Hassenfeld Children\u2019s Hospital and located within NYU Langone\u2019s Hospital for Joint Diseases , the Center for Children provides a kid-friendly, family-focused approach to treatment for children with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular disorders.\u00a0 We specialize in conditions affecting the bones, joints, and muscles, such as scoliosis , hip dysplasia , limb deformity, and cerebral palsy, as well as sports injuries, fractures, and trauma to the bones or joints. We are also world-renowned in treating certain rare disorders, such as arthrogryposis , in which your joints don\u2019t have the normal range of motion; Larsen syndrome, a condition that affects bone development; pseudoachondroplasia, a form of dwarfism that causes short limbs; and congenital insensitivity to pain. Our colorful walls and \u201cwhite coat-free\u201d culture help make you and your child feel relaxed during a stressful time. We have entertaining activities in our waiting rooms to keep children happy and engrossed while they wait to see a doctor.\u00a0 Special activities and events , such as storytelling and arts and crafts, are also scheduled throughout the week. Our child life team offers support during tests such as MRI scans, and helps with pain management and anxiety for children dealing with life-changing events such as spinal cord injury. Our goal is to revolutionize pediatric orthopaedic care by offering state-of-the-art treatments from an expert staff of board-certified pediatric specialists, all in one location. \u00a0 Our physicians work with a team of nurses, social workers, child life specialists, occupational and physical therapists, psychologists, and a genetic counselor to recommend the best treatment plan for each child.
