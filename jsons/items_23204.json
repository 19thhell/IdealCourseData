In fact, international students, defined by NYU as students who do not hold citizenship or permanent residency status in the United States, comprise roughly 16% of the most recent entering class on our New York campus. There are, however, important notes for international students to consider when applying for admission:       Financial aid to international students on our New York campus is only available for incoming freshmen. If offered admission, international students will be required to submit a certification of finances demonstrating that they will be able to fund their four years of study through a combination of their own funds and any financial assistance we may provide. Students should not submit a certification of finances or bank statements until after they are offered admission.     All applicants, regardless of citizenship, must apply online. Students outside the U.S. who must send application documents (e.g. diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in hardcopy form are strongly encouraged to do so well in advance of our stated application deadlines.     NYU does not consider undergraduate admissions applications from students who already possess a bachelor's degree in any academic area, with the exception of Nursing and all majors offered through the School of Engineering. (Students interested in a second bachelor's degree in Nursing may click here for information. Students interested in a second bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering may click here for more information.)     International students may be required to submit TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic results as proof of English language proficiency. Please review the English language proficiency section of the Standardized Tests page of our website for more information.       All applicants to NYU, regardless of citizenship, are held to the same admissions standards, and evaluated on the same admissions criteria.                                                                                          A note about certification of finances:                               It is not necessary for you to submit financial documents with your application. The New York University Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE), will be available online to students who are offered admission and who pay the enrollment deposit. All non-U.S. Citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents must file the AFCOE and submit appropriate evidence of their ability to finance their education before certificates for student visas (Form I-20) or exchange visitor visas (Form DS-2019) can be issued.   If you are admitted to NYU and your studies will be financed with your own savings, parental support, outside private or government scholarships, or any combination of these, you will need to send official letters or similar certificates as proof of such support. You will need to include your name and date of birth on each document you submit.   If you are currently in the United States at the time of your admission, you must submit a copy of your I-94 card. Please note that students holding F-1 or J-1 student visas are generally not allowed to work in the United States to earn money toward their education and are required to pursue a full-time course load each semester.

In most cases, international students who want to enroll in NYU Summer Sessions must obtain a student visa in order to attend. It is important to allow plenty of time between admission and the start of the program to ensure that all visa steps are completed. As such, all international students must submit their application in full, including language proficiency scores, by the March 15, 2015 application deadline. Permanent residents and individuals in the U.S. pursuant to certain non-immigrant visa categories are not required to submit visa documentation to enroll in courses. Please contact the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) with specific visa related questions at newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu .   All international students MUST check in with the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) upon arrival in order to be in compliance. Visit the OGS website for a list of dates and times for visiting student check in.   Note to international students from NYU Office of Global Services (OGS): Individuals who enter the U.S. on a B visa (tourist) or pursuant to visa waiver are not eligible to participate in a course of study at NYU as a visiting student. An F-1 or J-1 student is a nonimmigrant who is pursuing a &quot;full course of study&quot; to achieve a specific educational objective at an academic institution in the United States. Once the educational objective has been achieved, the F-1 or J-1 student is expected by the U.S. government to depart the U.S. Pursuant to these guidelines, University Programs sessions at New York University are designed to be singular academic experiences for international students. Therefore, international students are encouraged to have one such experience per year, and should not plan to apply for more than one University Programs session per year. Please contact OGS to clarify any questions related to your particular educational objective.   Currently studying IN the United States     International students studying in the US (at NYU or at another academic institution) who have an F-1 or J-1 visa are not required to submit additional visa documentation to enroll in courses at NYU.     Currently studying OUTSIDE the United States     NYU requires students enrolling in courses to have a F-1 or J-1 visa. The NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) can assist you in obtaining an I-20 to process your F-1 or J-1 visa. Once you have completed a program application, you will receive instructions for submitting the I-20/DS-2019 documentation. OGS will assist you in obtaining an I-20 to process your F-1 or J-1 visa. Contact them with specific visa related questions at newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu . You must fulfill the following requirements:     You must be enrolled as a full time student. Full-time enrollment can be defined in one of two ways: (1) You will need a minimum of 6 points for a 6-week session, 3 points for a 3-week session, or 12 points for a 12-week session. (2) You may take a course that meets a total of 18 hours per week.     You must provide Proof of English Proficiency as a part of program registration \u2013 acceptable formats:   TOEFL : minimum score of 600 on the paper-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 100 on the internet-based test; OR     IELTS : minimum overall score of 7.5; OR   Pearson's Test of English (PTE Academic);   University Transcript: If you attended an academic institution in which English is the language of instruction for at least a full academic year you may submit an official transcript in lieu of testing. (Transcripts submitted in lieu of testing must be identified as such via an email to english.proficiency@nyu.edu )           Please have TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE scores sent directly to NYU from the testing agency. NYU's institution code is 2562.

In most cases, international students who want to enroll in NYU Summer Sessions must obtain a student visa in order to attend. It is important to allow plenty of time between admission and the start of the program to ensure that all visa steps are completed. As such, all international students must submit their application in full, including language proficiency scores, by the March 15, 2015 application deadline. Permanent residents and individuals in the U.S. pursuant to certain non-immigrant visa categories are not required to submit visa documentation to enroll in courses. Please contact the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) with specific visa related questions at newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu .   All international students MUST check in with the NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) upon arrival in order to be in compliance. Visit the OGS website for a list of dates and times for visiting student check in.   Note to international students from NYU Office of Global Services (OGS): Individuals who enter the U.S. on a B visa (tourist) or pursuant to visa waiver are not eligible to participate in a course of study at NYU as a visiting student. An F-1 or J-1 student is a nonimmigrant who is pursuing a &quot;full course of study&quot; to achieve a specific educational objective at an academic institution in the United States. Once the educational objective has been achieved, the F-1 or J-1 student is expected by the U.S. government to depart the U.S. Pursuant to these guidelines, University Programs sessions at New York University are designed to be singular academic experiences for international students. Therefore, international students are encouraged to have one such experience per year, and should not plan to apply for more than one University Programs session per year. Please contact OGS to clarify any questions related to your particular educational objective.   Currently studying IN the United States     International students studying in the US (at NYU or at another academic institution) who have an F-1 or J-1 visa are not required to submit additional visa documentation to enroll in courses at NYU.     Currently studying OUTSIDE the United States     NYU requires students enrolling in courses to have a F-1 or J-1 visa. The NYU Office of Global Services (OGS) can assist you in obtaining an I-20 to process your F-1 or J-1 visa. Once you have completed a program application, you will receive instructions for submitting the I-20/DS-2019 documentation. OGS will assist you in obtaining an I-20 to process your F-1 or J-1 visa. Contact them with specific visa related questions at newinternationalstudents@nyu.edu . You must fulfill the following requirements:     You must be enrolled as a full time student. Full-time enrollment can be defined in one of two ways: (1) You will need a minimum of 6 points for a 6-week session, 3 points for a 3-week session, or 12 points for a 12-week session. (2) You may take a course that meets a total of 18 hours per week.     You must provide Proof of English Proficiency as a part of program registration \u2013 acceptable formats:   TOEFL : minimum score of 600 on the paper-based test, 250 on the computer-based test, or 100 on the internet-based test; OR     IELTS : minimum overall score of 7.5; OR   Pearson's Test of English (PTE Academic);   University Transcript: If you attended an academic institution in which English is the language of instruction for at least a full academic year you may submit an official transcript in lieu of testing. (Transcripts submitted in lieu of testing must be identified as such via an email to english.proficiency@nyu.edu )           Please have TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE scores sent directly to NYU from the testing agency.

In fact, international students, defined by NYU as students who do not hold citizenship or permanent residency status in the United States, comprise roughly 16% of the most recent entering class on our New York campus. There are, however, important notes for international students to consider when applying for admission:       Financial aid to international students on our New York campus is only available for incoming freshmen. If offered admission, international students will be required to submit a certification of finances demonstrating that they will be able to fund their four years of study through a combination of their own funds and any financial assistance we may provide. Students should not submit a certification of finances or bank statements until after they are offered admission.     All applicants, regardless of citizenship, must apply online. Students outside the U.S. who must send application documents (e.g. diplomas, transcripts, etc.) in hardcopy form are strongly encouraged to do so well in advance of our stated application deadlines.     NYU does not consider undergraduate admissions applications from students who already possess a bachelor's degree in any academic area, with the exception of Nursing and all majors offered through the School of Engineering. (Students interested in a second bachelor's degree in Nursing may click here for information. Students interested in a second bachelor's degree at the Polytechnic School of Engineering may click here for more information.)     International students may be required to submit TOEFL, IELTS, or PTE Academic results as proof of English language proficiency. Please review the English language proficiency section of the Standardized Tests page of our website for more information.       All applicants to NYU, regardless of citizenship, are held to the same admissions standards, and evaluated on the same admissions criteria.                                                                                          A note about certification of finances:                               It is not necessary for you to submit financial documents with your application. The New York University Application for Certificate of Eligibility (AFCOE), will be available online to students who are offered admission and who pay the enrollment deposit. All non-U.S. Citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents must file the AFCOE and submit appropriate evidence of their ability to finance their education before certificates for student visas (Form I-20) or exchange visitor visas (Form DS-2019) can be issued.   If you are admitted to NYU and your studies will be financed with your own savings, parental support, outside private or government scholarships, or any combination of these, you will need to send official letters or similar certificates as proof of such support. You will need to include your name and date of birth on each document you submit.   If you are currently in the United States at the time of your admission, you must submit a copy of your I-94 card. Please note that students holding F-1 or J-1 student visas are generally not allowed to work in the United States to earn money toward their education and are required to pursue a full-time course load each semester.

The program recognizes the changing nature of the contemporary political and economic environment and seeks to lay an interdisciplinary basis for understanding these changes. It provides students with an opportunity to study the complex web of transnational politics in an in-depth, interdisciplinary fashion. The breadth of courses is designed to match the breadth of knowledge and skills that the field requires. Fluency in a foreign language and a semester of study abroad at a site where that language is spoken are required of all majors to help ensure that they acquire a deeper understanding of a country\u2019s culture and institutions. In their junior or senior year, majors are also encouraged, though not required, to take advantage of the many internship opportunities that are available in New York City to students of international relations.
