The   Eiffel Tower, symbol of the city, dominates the skyline. North of the   Seine, the Right Bank is home to monumental buildings, grand boulevards,   and major museums, including the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou. The   Left Bank (rive gauche) invokes a Bohemian and intellectual atmosphere   with its university communities, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, jazz clubs, and   chic boutiques. NYU Paris is located in the Latin Quarter, the   thriving historic and intellectual heart of Paris and  students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural,   artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood. Prerequisite: Tisch Film Majors: Sight &amp; Sound: Film and Sight &amp; Sound: Studio   (or Sight &amp; Sound: Documentary). NYU Non-film majors: Sight and Sound or Fundamentals of Digital Filmmaking Visiting Students: College Level Experience in Film Production  Program Curriculum Students must take the following two courses, for a total of 7 units.  Intermediate Experimental Workshop IFMTV-UT 1049.001 4 units Instructor: Darrell Wilson A production course in which students experiment with non-narrative approaches to content, structure, technique, and style. Themes and orientations include many possibilities, such as music, choreography, visual or audio art, investigations of rhythm, color, shape, and line; poetry, fragmentation and collage, abstraction, performance; and subversion of linear narrative and documentary conventions. (Prospective students who wish to direct films are encouraged to obtain a list of proposal guidelines for each section from the professor before the semester begins.) Note: Films produced for Intermediate Experimental Workshop will not be eligible for awards in the First Run Film Festival if they are longer than 15 minutes, including titles. All films produced in Intermediate Experimental Workshop will be screened if entered in the First Run Festival, but those longer than 15 minutes will not be judged.  Media Mavericks: A Critical Examination of Film and Video IFMTV-UT 1002.001 3 units Instructor: Darrell Wilson This class is a critical examination of experimental film and video with and emphasis on makers in France. There are no criteria for an avant-garde film or video, only the expectation that by watching it a viewer will be introduced to a challenging, refreshingly unfamiliar language that, by the end of the piece, he or she will have begun to speak. This new language many be politically confrontational, aesthetically difficult, lyrical, or rhythmical, but no matter what the form, it will express the particular vision of the artist who produced it. Challenging as this work may be for any audience, a close viewing of these \u201cavant-garde\u201d pieces will expand on your appreciation of their poetry and complexity. Whether you call these films experimental, alternative, independent, personal or poetic, they share very little save for their adventurous desire to reawaken those dormant visual and aural sensibilities that may have been hypnotized into years of sleep by too much commercial, mainstream media.

The degree requirements for a BFA in Drama include a minimum of three years of professional training, but many choose to continue beyond that. Professional training is deeply intertwined with a substantial academic curriculum throughout your entire career here at NYU. There are two phases of professional training in the Drama department: a primary training phase and an advanced training phase. The primary training phase occurs in your first two years and gives students a strong foundation in the skills needed to proceed onto an advanced level of training. Upon acceptance into the department, students are placed into one of seven different primary training studios where they begin intensive conservatory training towards a strong foundation in technique. Students remain in their primary training studio for four consecutive semesters to complete a progressive curriculum. Each semester builds upon the last. The advanced training phase begins once primary training is completed. Students may take advantage of a variety of additional professional training options, which include advanced training at their own or other primary studios, more specialized training, study abroad and internships.

All students must enroll in the following course:      Writing for the Screen NCRD-UT 1000    Participants will examine the principles and   processes of writing for the screen. Topics include finding and   developing story ideas, film language and script structure. By the end   of the course, students will have participated in in-depth film analysis   and intensive screenwriting exercises and discussions. At the end of   the course, students are expected to complete a film treatment (prose   description of your film) with a step outline for a feature film or T.V.   episode you plan to write. In addition, you must hand in the first   scene (3-5 pages) of your script with dialogue. Non-credit tuition: $1,790 View course schedule . Next, students must enroll in two (2) of the following production courses.    Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Filmmaking    NCRD-UT 43    Every student will conceive, produce, direct and edit five short projects (3 silent and 2 with sound) with digital filmmaking technology. Working in crews of four, students will be exposed to a variety of specific assignments in visual storytelling that feature a broad spectrum of technical, aesthetic, craft and logistical problems to be solved. Collaborating with other students through rotating crew positions will be a central focus of all production work. Lectures, labs, critiques, technical seminars, screenings and written production books will be an important component of this class. All student work is screened and discussed in class. Students should not schedule any other course on the same days as Sight &amp; Sound: Filmmaking. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule . Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Studio   NCRD-UT 51                              The course provides an in-depth   exploration of the creative capabilities (technical, logistical,   aesthetic) of producing narrative-based studio production work in a   multiple camera television studio environment. Students will be trained   in working with actors and learning how to connect script and   performance to the production of four short studio based projects (each   of increasing complexity). Students will have the opportunity to develop   a single idea into a full-scale production that will be produced \"live\"   in the studio at the end of the semester. The fundamental skills   learned in this class (script, performance, lighting, camera, art   direction, coverage) will serve as a foundation for all narrative-,   experimental-, and documentary-based production work and will be   applicable in classes. Note: some casting and rehearsals will need to   be undertaken outside of class. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .  Fundamentals of Sight and Sound: Documentary   NCRD-UT 80 The   course teaches students to look at their world and to develop the   ability to create compelling and dramatic stories in which real people   are the characters and real life is the plot. Through close study and   analysis of feature length and short documentaries, as well as hands on   directing, shooting, sound-recording and editing, students rigorously   explore the possibilities and the power of non-fiction storytelling for   video. The course is a dynamic combination of individual and group   production work in which each student will be expected to complete five   projects. Non-credit tuition: $5,743 Lab fee: $566 View course schedule .  Intermediate Experimental Workshop    NCRD-UT 1046 Prerequisite: NCRD-UT 43 | Sight and Sound Film Production A production course in which students experiment with non-narrative   approaches to content, structure, technique, and style. Themes and   orientations include many possibilities, such as music, choreography,   visual or audio art, investigations of rhythm, color, shape, and line;   poetry, fragmentation and collage, abstraction, performance; and   subversion of linear narrative and documentary conventions.  Non-credit tuition: $5,743    Lab fee: $566 View course schedule . Intermediate Production: The Short Commercial Form    NCRD-UT 1246 Prerequisite: NCRD-UT 43 | Sight and Sound Film Production From the Silver Screen and the television screen to computer portals,   the iPod and cell phones, the proscenium for motion pictures, videos,   commercials and new forms of web based media has evolved/de-evolved into   ever decreasing screen sizes for moving image based media content and   distribution. As screen sizes have decreased, opportunities have   increased for emerging technologies to facilitate the production and   distribution of both long and short form film, video and animation based   work. This class is intended for students with an interest in exploring   the creative and commercial aspects of the short form (30 seconds to 7   minutes). The goal of this class is for students to produce work that   results in a series of final projects that can serve as the basis of a   demo reel that will also be \"uploaded\" to a class created web site. 10   Advanced Short Form projects will be selected on the basis of a variety   of classroom research projects and concept pitches. Students will be   able to produce up to 15 minutes of completed \"short form\" work   throughout the semester working in a variety of short form genres.
