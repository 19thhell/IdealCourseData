Graduate students in any discipline whose  dissertation projects touch upon translation\u2014its theory, practices, and  history\u2014are invited to apply. Between  twelve and fifteen students who have completed and defended their dissertation  proposal and have (minimally) begun drafting their dissertations will be  awarded summer fellowships of $7,500 to attend. We welcome applications from  students working in any discipline in which translation is an important  conceptual problem, and whose dissertation topic explicitly and centrally  treats the problem.

Applications  should be submitted to this address:     Professor Jacques Lezra     Department of Comparative Literature     New York University     Room 303, 13-19 University Place     New York, NY 10003             Translation  at NYU         New York  University is particularly well suited to host this important    scholarly  project and conversation: translators knock knees here with    theorists  of translation, there are graduate programs in the practices    and  theory of translation, and the University has committed itself in    recent  months to major publication ventures in the field of    translation.   And of course the city of New York is itself a sort of    inexhaustible  translation hub\u2014commercial as well as intellectual.             The  Seminar Leaders         Emily  Apter and Jacques Lezra are scholars of literature and critical    theory  who focus their research and much of their teaching on the    problem  of translation. Apter, Professor of French and Comparative    Literature,  published The Translation Zone: A New Comparative    Literature  in 2006 and edits the book series Translation/Transnation    with  Princeton University Press (founded in 1998 the series now has    some  fifteen titles to its list, many of them prize-winners). Jacques    Lezra,  Professor of Spanish, English and Comparative Literature, in    addition  to authoring important articles on the theory and history of    translation,  is the award-winning translator of Paul de Man's classic    Blindness  and Insight into Spanish. Apter and Lezra come to    translation  studies from complementary critical positions and    chronologically  quite different periods\u2014Apter, from a formation in    19th,  20th and 21st century French, Francophone, English and American    literature  and criticism, Lezra, from a formation in the European    literary  and philosophical traditions of the 15th through the late    17th  century. Together (along with Michael Wood, Professor of English    and  Comparative Literature at Princeton) they are supervising the    translation  into English of Barbara Cassin\u2019s monumental Vocabulaire    Europ\u00e9en  des Philosophies: dictionnaire des intraduisibles (Paris:        Editions du  Seuil, 2004), which will be published by Princeton    University  Press. Each of them is currently beginning work on a book    about  translation: Apter, a book tentatively titled Against World    Literature?  The Politics of Untranslatability in Comparative    Literature;  Lezra a book titled The Indecisive Muse: Translation and    Lexical  Culture in European Modernity.

Description       The problems and pleasures of translation have shaped cultural, economic, intellectual, religious, and diplomatic interactions for centuries. Emily Apter has noted that \u201cthe 9/11 tragedy, followed on its heels by the Iraq invasion and occupation, has contributed to the focus on translation in film, fiction, academic research, and the media.\u201d In an increasingly globalized and technologized world, we translate across linguistic and cultural boundaries all the time. Looking at translation as a powerful dynamic in our daily interactions helps us to understand the world in which we live. In this seminar, we will explore many aspects of cross-linguistic communication, including language acquisition, textual translation, professional interpreting, and the role of technology in translation. In addition to reading and comparing translations of literary texts, we will engage with theoretical works about translation, statements written by translators about their craft and profession, and recent news articles about the politics of translation and translation in politics. In various essays and projects, students will be encouraged to pursue a range of topics that reflect their interests and curiosities about language and intercultural exchange. Readings may include works by Apter, David Bellos, Edith Grossman, Octavio Paz, and Lawrence Vanuti.

It aims at educating a much needed  new generation of literary translators. The program is supported by all the  faculty members of the prestigious NYU French department and, as such, is  guaranteed to offer an equally top-rate theoretical and analytical education in  translation.         NYU provides the perfect environment for this type of  program in translation. Our two main  advantages are 1) our location in New York City where, besides the French Publishers\u2019  Agency, the vast majority of American publishers likely to publish French books  in translation are located, and 2) the NYU Paris center, where the students  will spend a six-week Summer session allowing them to meet with contemporary  French writers, publishers, and foreign rights managers. For more information, check out our Facebook page and the blog created by Literary Translation students.  Admission The  requirements for admission are a B.A. with a strong concentration of French  (e.g. major in French literature or language, major in Comparative literature  with a specialization in French literature); a statement of purpose (2 pages double-spaced); a translation sample consisting of approximately 3000 words (double-spaced) translated from the French (fiction, drama, essay, poetry, or  social sciences) with a photocopy of the original including all the necessary  references; three letters of recommendation; an official transcript of  undergraduate studies; GRE scores; and TOEFL scores (for those whose native  language is not English). ( http://gsas.nyu.edu/page/grad.admissionsapplication )      Applications are accepted for fall admission only .      The application deadline is April 15th, 2015.                      Program content and  requirements This one-year program (Fall and Spring semester in New York,  intensive six-week Summer session in France) will comprise eight four-credit  courses (32 credits in total) plus a thesis. Two thesis formats will be  accepted:      1) The typical thesis will consist of the original translation  of a book-long piece, such as a play, a collection of short stories, poems or  essays, a short novel or a long novella, preceded by a foreword-type analysis  of the specific translation problems raised by the text.      2) For students interested in a more fully analytical  approach, the thesis could consist of a 60- to 100-page comparative study of  existing translations. List of Courses  Fall: Theory of Translation: FREN-GA 1020 A survey course that will inform students on the major  issues at stake in literary translation by means of a broad history of  translation theory, from the Romans to the twentieth century with a particular  focus on French theorists, and through a more focused study of specific  problems in literary translation, such as poetry and translation, translating  dramatic texts, translating the vernaculars, etc.                  Stylistics and Semantics of Written French: FREN-GA 1022 Ce cours propose  un entra\u00eenement intensif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9crit.

Students will work on methodology and  research issues related to translating a piece of publishable length and learn  about the revising and editing process involved in translation.                      Six-week Summer  Session in France (from mid-May to the end of June): Translation II: FREN-GA 2009/9003 This course will be a course in translation analysis and  comparative poetics. It will teach the students to read and analyze texts in translation and, through comparative  analysis, they will learn about specific issues raised by literary translation  (issues related to textual genres, cultural issues, prosodic and rhythmic  issues, register and dialect issues, etc.) as well as gain a concrete historical  knowledge of translation theory.                  Creative Writing Workshop: FREN-GA 2000/9000 Regular submission and discussion and analysis of student  work in one or more fictional modes (short story, short novel, novel, etc.),  with examination of relevant readings illustrating point of view, plot,  setting, characterization, dialogue, and aspects of style.

Graduate students in any discipline whose  dissertation projects touch upon translation\u2014its theory, practices, and  history\u2014are invited to apply. Between  twelve and fifteen students who have completed and defended their dissertation  proposal and have (minimally) begun drafting their dissertations will be  awarded summer fellowships of $7,500 to attend. We welcome applications from  students working in any discipline in which translation is an important  conceptual problem, and whose dissertation topic explicitly and centrally  treats the problem.

Applications  should be submitted to this address:     Professor Jacques Lezra     Department of Comparative Literature     New York University     Room 303, 13-19 University Place     New York, NY 10003             Translation  at NYU         New York  University is particularly well suited to host this important    scholarly  project and conversation: translators knock knees here with    theorists  of translation, there are graduate programs in the practices    and  theory of translation, and the University has committed itself in    recent  months to major publication ventures in the field of    translation.   And of course the city of New York is itself a sort of    inexhaustible  translation hub\u2014commercial as well as intellectual.             The  Seminar Leaders         Emily  Apter and Jacques Lezra are scholars of literature and critical    theory  who focus their research and much of their teaching on the    problem  of translation. Apter, Professor of French and Comparative    Literature,  published The Translation Zone: A New Comparative    Literature  in 2006 and edits the book series Translation/Transnation    with  Princeton University Press (founded in 1998 the series now has    some  fifteen titles to its list, many of them prize-winners). Jacques    Lezra,  Professor of Spanish, English and Comparative Literature, in    addition  to authoring important articles on the theory and history of    translation,  is the award-winning translator of Paul de Man's classic    Blindness  and Insight into Spanish. Apter and Lezra come to    translation  studies from complementary critical positions and    chronologically  quite different periods\u2014Apter, from a formation in    19th,  20th and 21st century French, Francophone, English and American    literature  and criticism, Lezra, from a formation in the European    literary  and philosophical traditions of the 15th through the late    17th  century. Together (along with Michael Wood, Professor of English    and  Comparative Literature at Princeton) they are supervising the    translation  into English of Barbara Cassin\u2019s monumental Vocabulaire    Europ\u00e9en  des Philosophies: dictionnaire des intraduisibles (Paris:        Editions du  Seuil, 2004), which will be published by Princeton    University  Press. Each of them is currently beginning work on a book    about  translation: Apter, a book tentatively titled Against World    Literature?  The Politics of Untranslatability in Comparative    Literature;  Lezra a book titled The Indecisive Muse: Translation and    Lexical  Culture in European Modernity.

Description       The problems and pleasures of translation have shaped cultural, economic, intellectual, religious, and diplomatic interactions for centuries. Emily Apter has noted that \u201cthe 9/11 tragedy, followed on its heels by the Iraq invasion and occupation, has contributed to the focus on translation in film, fiction, academic research, and the media.\u201d In an increasingly globalized and technologized world, we translate across linguistic and cultural boundaries all the time. Looking at translation as a powerful dynamic in our daily interactions helps us to understand the world in which we live. In this seminar, we will explore many aspects of cross-linguistic communication, including language acquisition, textual translation, professional interpreting, and the role of technology in translation. In addition to reading and comparing translations of literary texts, we will engage with theoretical works about translation, statements written by translators about their craft and profession, and recent news articles about the politics of translation and translation in politics. In various essays and projects, students will be encouraged to pursue a range of topics that reflect their interests and curiosities about language and intercultural exchange. Readings may include works by Apter, David Bellos, Edith Grossman, Octavio Paz, and Lawrence Vanuti.
