                                        Roger Friedland    Visiting Professor              Phone: 212-998-5424    Email: friedland@nyu.edu         Departments:         Media, Culture, and Communication                Roger Friedland is a cultural sociologist of religion who seeks to think about the ways in which material practices in an institution performatively mediate between the observable and unobservable, between objects and the metaphysical. He wants, in other words, to explore the limits of a religious sociology. Friedland is doing survey research using social network sites on the relation between love, gender, sexuality and religion both in Muslim majority countries like Egypt, Iran, Tunisia and Turkey with Professor Janet Afary and on American university students with John Mohr and Paolo Gardinali. Friedland also uses politicized religions around the world as sites through which to develop an institutional logical approach. And he is currently working with Diane-Laure Arjalies on the missing object in the institutional logical approach thinking through calculative devices and metrics within finance and prayer, pilgrimage and moral accounting practices within Christian religion. Friedland is the co-author of The Fellowship: Frank Lloyd Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship and To Rule Jerusalem. His most recent project was Guilty Objects : Seeing Through Orhan Pamuk&rsquo;s Museum of Innocence, a personal mirror museum of Pamuk&rsquo;s physical site in Istanbul produced with his research practicum at NYU Abu Dhabi.   Friedland is also a blogger for Huffington Post . Friedland joins the MCC faculty after teaching in the Departments of Religious Studies and Sociology at UC Santa Barbara, Social Research and Public Policy at NYU Abu Dhabi, and the Department of Accounting and Management Control at the HEC in Paris.
