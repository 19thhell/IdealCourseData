The intensive and rigorous training received in studio is contextualized within and enriched by knowledge of the theatre as an art and an institution, with a history, a literature, and a vital role in culture.       In order to fulfill a Theatre Studies requirement, your grades in these classes (including Introduction to Theatre Studies &amp; Introduction to Theatre Production) must be at least &quot;C&quot; (2.0).\u00a0 If your grade is lower, the points will be used as Electives. If you get an &quot;F,\u201d the points will not count toward graduation at all. If you repeat a course that is non-repeatable, you will not receive any credit.    Automatic WAITLISTS have been activated in the registration system for ALL advanced Theatre Studies.\u00a0 If a class is waitlist activated and you opt to join the waitlist, you are responsible for monitoring your registration status in that class. The automatic waitlist is only active through the first week of the term.    The Drama Department accepts up to 8 points of Theatre Studies credit from another academic institution, provided that the courses are equivalent to courses offered in the Department. These credits can come only from approved permits to register off-campus, including Study Abroad. If you have questions about this, speak to the Director of Theatre Studies.       Introductory Theatre Studies Courses    All Drama students are required to take seven Theatre Studies courses. Two must be the Introductory (Group A) courses. First year students take Introduction to Theatre Studies (ITS) and Introduction to Theatrical Production (ITP). The order in which these are taken is up to the student; both are required before taking other Theatre Studies courses.     If a Drama student fails ITS in the first year, he or she must repeat it in the second year. A special evening section is offered in the fall term to accommodate students in the second year of studio who must re-take ITS.     Advanced Theatre Studies Courses    Of the five advanced Theatre Studies courses, two must be in World Drama or Theatre History (Group C). The other three required courses may come from either the B or the C categories.       The majority of texts of Theatre Studies B courses \u2013 Studies in Drama and Performance \u2013 focus primarily on Western drama post-WW II.    The majority of texts of Theatre Studies C courses -- Theatre History or World Drama \u2013 date from before WW II or examine non-North American, non-European theatre traditions.    A new way to earn Theatre Studies C credit!!! Successful completion of both versions of the elective Costume Period Style I (H28.0181) \u2013 offered each fall - and Costume Period Style II (H28.0182) \u2013 offered each spring \u2013 will satisfy a Theatre Studies C requirement.    \u00a0       Policy on Practicum Courses    Drama students can take only two practicum courses for theatre studies credit. Additional practicum classes will count as elective credit. Students who have a compelling reason to take a third practicum for theatre studies credit can do so if they obtain a waiver. Waivers are granted by the Chair of the Drama department in consultation with the Director of Theatre Studies.    Playwriting Practicum (H95.1040), or equivalent, may be taken only one time for Theatre Studies credit. If a student elects to take Advanced Playwriting (H95.1041), or equivalent, this course only counts as an Elective. It will not fulfill a Theatre Studies requirement.     Repeatable Theatre Studies Courses    Courses are NOT REPEATABLE for credit unless stated otherwise. Certain courses (such as Major Playwrights or Theatrical Genres) may be repeated one time, provided the special focus of the topic changes. If you\u2019re not certain, please check with an advisor.    Theatre Studies Courses Offered Through Other Departments    Courses offered through another department that are related to theatre (such as Shakespeare in the English Department, or any course with the words Theatre, Acting or Performance, etc in the title) will only count as elective credit. This is a State regulation. Majors must acquire Liberal Arts credit in areas other than their major. Drama students should fulfill their Theatre Studies requirements through the Drama department.    Theatre Studies (H28) courses that are cross-listed with another department (such as English or Dramatic Lit) will only count as Theatre Studies credit \u2013 NOT HUMANITIES. Please make sure that you register under the Drama (H28) course number!!
