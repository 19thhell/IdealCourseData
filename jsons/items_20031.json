Course Description  A large number---arguably the majority---of problems in science, engineering, medicine, and business involve optimization problems in which we seek to minimize or maximize an ``objective function'' subject to constraints. This course will survey widely used methods for continuous optimization, focusing on both theoretical foundations and implementation as numerical software.

Coursework  The course requirements include class attendance, written and programming homework assignments, and a course project. All of these will count in your final grade.  The final grade will be calculated by averaging the two elements (homework and project) with weights of 60% and 40%, where the weighting will be chosen for each student to maximize his/her grade.

Official Course Description  Nonlinear optimization problems arise in many different application areas. The goal is to minimize some function, such as cost or energy, often subject to constraints on the variables. This course presents and analyzes numerical methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems, together with the underlying mathematical theory on which they are based. Programming projects, using Matlab and software libraries, will be assigned. Topics covered include: Newton, quasi-Newton and conjugate gradient methods for unconstrained optimization in both line search and trust region frameworks, and penalty, barrier and successive quadratic programming methods for nonlinear programming.   Should you take this course?  The course lectures take place only once a week, and this means they will move fast. The course is about nonlinear optimization which is a very  important practical tool but also has a rich mathematical theory. Hopefully, if you like math and computing, you will like this class. On the other hand, if your math background is weak, or you have no experience with computing, you are likely to find it difficult. Don't hesitate to discuss these issues with me, in my office or after class.

It is important that you do the homework yourself, but when you get stuck, I encourage you to consult with other students, or the math computer  consultant, or me, to get help when necessary. However, when you get help, it's important to acknowledge it in writing. Passing off other people's  work as your own is called plagiarism and is not acceptable. Homework may be given to me in class or in my office, or left under my office door.  Please do not leave homework in my lobby mailbox or send it by email.  Please staple all pages together. Late homework will be penalized 20%.  Homework will not be accepted more than one week late, except in special circumstances.     Oral Final Exam:  25 minutes in my office, ideally Mon May 9, Tue May 10 or Wed May 11. Please email me if you don't yet have an appointment. The emphasis will be on what you did for the homework. Here are the topics.    Line search methods and convergence via Zoutendijk's theorem  Newton's Method: quadratic convergence and approaches to indefiniteness  Conjugate gradient methods: linear and nonlinear  Quasi-Newton methods: BFGS and limited-memory BFGS   First and second order optimality conditions for nonlinear programming  The simplex method for linear programming  Primal-dual interior point methods for linear programming  Methods for nonlinear programming   You choose one topic and I choose one, and we will talk about what you learned about it. I will not choose the same topic for all students. You do not have to memorize complicated details, but you should be able to explain the main ideas that we talked about in class and that you explored in the homework. You are not expected to read details in the text that we did not cover in class. In particular, I don't expect you to read the last four chapters of the text that I just posted; they are in very rough form and are posted \"fyi\".     Text Book  Nonlinear Optimization, by Nocedal and Wright.       Software  For experimenting with our own optimization programs, Matlab is a good choice. Matlab is an excellent environment for small-scale numerical computing. However, its Optimization Toolbox is not very good.  See here for an excellent up-to-date guide to optimization software.  Optimization problems can be submitted over the web to   NEOS . Another great resource is the modeling language   AMPL .    Matlab is a product of The MathWorks . You can order your own copy of   Matlab for $99  or you can use Matlab on the Courant Sparcstation network (or dial in from home). For Matlab documentation, type \"helpdesk\" at the Matlab prompt. To get started, try out  A Free Matlab Online Tutorial or   Another Tuturial  or look for others by a web search. You may want to look at a very outdated but still useful   Introductory Matlab Primer (3rd and last edition, postscript file) . There are many books on Matlab; I recommend  Matlab Guide, by  Higham and Higham , but you will find many other resources on the web, including the latest information on Matlab 7.0.      Math Computer Consultant  There is a volunteer    Math Computer Consultant (email: mconsult@cims.nyu.edu).  Please contact the consultant if you have trouble with the Courant computer facilities or questions about the software we are using. The consultant is there to help, but cannot debug programs for you.    Class Mailing List  Important: you must join the    class mailing list .  There are two steps to joining the list; the first is to follow the instructions on the web page (including picking  a password), and the second is to REPLY TO the confirmation message sent to you by the system. This list will be used for important announcements. You can also send questions or comments to this list yourself (contact me if you have questions about when this is appropriate). If you do not want to use an NYU email address, be sure to notify me in person or by email from an NYU address about your preferred address, so I can add it to my spam filter.     Sun Account  If you don't have a Sun workstation account, please request one, even if you plan to do most of the homework on your home computer. You might need it later, depending on software requirements. Request this account from petagna@cs if you are registered in CS and from the math department if you are registered in math.    SIAM  As an NYU graduate student you have the opportunity to join   SIAM for free. SIAM is the main professional organization for applied and computational math, and offers a number of  benefits to members. I've been a member since I was a graduate student, and have benefitted in many ways from my association with SIAM.     Don't Hesitate to Ask for Help  If you have questions, send me email, give me a call, or drop by my office. Don't wait until it's too late!"}]}]
