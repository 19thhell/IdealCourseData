More About Proxy Servers   A proxy server is a server that sits between a client application, such as a web browser, and a remote server. The proxy server  intercepts each request to the remote server to see if it can fulfill the request itself. If not, it forwards the request to the  remote server. When a proxy server receives a request for an Internet service, such as a web page, if the request passes the  filtering requirements, the proxy server first looks in its local cache of previously downloaded web pages. If it finds the page,  it returns it to the person who requested it without needing to forward the request to the Internet. If it does not find the page, the  proxy server acts on behalf of the person and uses its own IP address to request the web page from the Internet.    An advantage of using a proxy server is that it can improve overall response time, since frequently-requested Internet sites are  likely to be in the proxy's cache.

Here, they are pictured during a day in the Catskills.                   Jacobs Women View Gallery         \">    The Anatomy of an Entrepreneur , the late Joseph J. Jacobs&rsquo;s memoir, is dedicated to his wife Violet &ldquo;Vi&rdquo; Jabara Jacobs, of whom he wrote: &ldquo;With a modesty that belies the great woman she is and loyalty that I cannot live without, Vi is the heart in the anatomy of this entrepreneur. Because of her, I breathe.&rdquo;   Vi was not, however, the first woman to help set the course of Jacobs&rsquo; life. That distinction belongs to his mother, Affifie, who gave birth to him in 1916 and raised him in Brooklyn&rsquo;s tightknit Lebanese-American community. Although she never learned to read or write, Affifie was resolutely ambitious for her children, and when he contemplated quitting school in order to take on a fulltime job, it was Affifie who insisted that he complete his college education at what was then known as the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. (Probably few current students&mdash;even those who know of Jacobs&rsquo; incredible generosity to his alma mater&mdash;grasp that the fortunes of their school might have been very different had it not been for one fiercely determined Lebanese matriarch.) Jacobs&rsquo; sisters Evelyn and Helen were equally instrumental in his education: the two were among the most successful designers of lingerie in the country, and they readily funded his Poly tuition.   In the late 1930s, however, Jacobs met the woman who would inarguably affect his life the most profoundly. Vi Jabara was both charming and pretty, and Jacobs, then a graduate student at Poly, was immediately smitten. Vi settled dutifully into the role of helpmate even before their 1942 wedding, typing eight copies of Jacobs&rsquo; 180-page thesis (in the days before Xerox machines) and coaching him in the German and French he needed to earn his Ph.D. The word dutiful unquestionably continued to describe her after the wedding. In 1947, when her husband set out to found Jacobs Engineering, which later became one of the world&rsquo;s most successful engineering firms, Vi worked alongside him, providing secretarial services and unwavering support. Although her contributions were invaluable, she was characteristically modest about them. With no mention of her own toil and sacrifice, Vi told one journalist, &ldquo;I am so proud of what Joe has accomplished. Every time I look at the name Jacobs Engineering atop the headquarters...I get a thrill.&rdquo; For his part, Jacobs frequently acknowledged that he could not have prospered in life without Vi playing a traditional role by his side. &ldquo;Her faith, pride in me, and respect for me were not something to be trumpeted. They were a given,&rdquo; he wrote.   If Jacobs enjoyed the benefits of having a traditional wife and helpmate in Vi, he discovered a new breed of women in his daughters: Margaret, Linda, and Valerie. Smart and independent, the three grew into political liberals and feminists. In the preface to Jacobs&rsquo; second book, The Compassionate Conservative , the trio wrote, &ldquo;At times, our [family] discussions became loud and heated, with him calling us irrational and us calling him insensitive. During one such battle, he accused us of being opinionated, and we responded, &ldquo;Where do you think we learned it?&rsquo;&rdquo;   Jacobs, cognizant of the pitfalls of forcing offspring into a family business, encouraged his daughters to follow their own passions. With little interest in engineering, Meg became a social worker; Val chose to establish a private practice as a marriage and family counselor; and Linda became an archaeologist and scholar of the Middle East. Gratified that each of their daughters was making her own way in the world, Joe and Vi nonetheless wanted the entire family to participate in one important joint project: in 1989 they established the Jacobs Family Foundation, so that each of the five members of the immediate family could have an equal say in philanthropic matters.   Jacobs&rsquo; alma mater proved a gratifying opportunity for giving. Poly, as Jacobs wrote in his memoir, &ldquo;was primarily for bright disadvantaged kids, as I had been, who would be the hungry entrepreneurs of the future.&rdquo; Linda and her father both ultimately sat on the school&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, and as two-time chair, Joe Jacobs was instrumental in guiding the school through some of its most challenging financial trials. So generous and far-reaching was the family&rsquo;s support that in Changing the World: The First 150 Years , a history of what is now known as the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, nine pages are devoted to the topic.   With Linda administering a trust that bears her mother&rsquo;s name and the chairmanship of the family foundation rotating among Val; her husband, Norman Hapke; and their children, the Jacobs family&rsquo;s commitment to bettering the world continues.

If you're looking for the NYU Libraries EZProxy service, please contact the Libraries instead.        This legacy NYU-NET Proxy is being prepared for retirement; if possible, we encourage you to begin using VPN instead.                                        Important Note VPN is the best way to securely connect to NYU services from off campus. Unless you are sure that you need to use NYU-NET Proxy to connect to a certain resource, try using the NYU VPN service first.     NYU-NET Proxy helps you authenticate yourself as an NYU community member when you are connecting to certain    NYU resources from outside of NYU-NET. Using NYU-NET Proxy, your browser will employ a computer system here at    the University to help it access your remote destination (see the bottom of this page for more information about    proxy servers . When accessing NYU-NET in this way, you will be asked to type in your NYU NetID and password    (which is the same as your password for NYUHome).

More About Proxy Servers   A proxy server is a server that sits between a client application, such as a web browser, and a remote server. The proxy server  intercepts each request to the remote server to see if it can fulfill the request itself. If not, it forwards the request to the  remote server. When a proxy server receives a request for an Internet service, such as a web page, if the request passes the  filtering requirements, the proxy server first looks in its local cache of previously downloaded web pages. If it finds the page,  it returns it to the person who requested it without needing to forward the request to the Internet. If it does not find the page, the  proxy server acts on behalf of the person and uses its own IP address to request the web page from the Internet.    An advantage of using a proxy server is that it can improve overall response time, since frequently-requested Internet sites are  likely to be in the proxy's cache.

Here, they are pictured during a day in the Catskills.                   Jacobs Women View Gallery         \">    The Anatomy of an Entrepreneur , the late Joseph J. Jacobs&rsquo;s memoir, is dedicated to his wife Violet &ldquo;Vi&rdquo; Jabara Jacobs, of whom he wrote: &ldquo;With a modesty that belies the great woman she is and loyalty that I cannot live without, Vi is the heart in the anatomy of this entrepreneur. Because of her, I breathe.&rdquo;   Vi was not, however, the first woman to help set the course of Jacobs&rsquo; life. That distinction belongs to his mother, Affifie, who gave birth to him in 1916 and raised him in Brooklyn&rsquo;s tightknit Lebanese-American community. Although she never learned to read or write, Affifie was resolutely ambitious for her children, and when he contemplated quitting school in order to take on a fulltime job, it was Affifie who insisted that he complete his college education at what was then known as the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. (Probably few current students&mdash;even those who know of Jacobs&rsquo; incredible generosity to his alma mater&mdash;grasp that the fortunes of their school might have been very different had it not been for one fiercely determined Lebanese matriarch.) Jacobs&rsquo; sisters Evelyn and Helen were equally instrumental in his education: the two were among the most successful designers of lingerie in the country, and they readily funded his Poly tuition.   In the late 1930s, however, Jacobs met the woman who would inarguably affect his life the most profoundly. Vi Jabara was both charming and pretty, and Jacobs, then a graduate student at Poly, was immediately smitten. Vi settled dutifully into the role of helpmate even before their 1942 wedding, typing eight copies of Jacobs&rsquo; 180-page thesis (in the days before Xerox machines) and coaching him in the German and French he needed to earn his Ph.D. The word dutiful unquestionably continued to describe her after the wedding. In 1947, when her husband set out to found Jacobs Engineering, which later became one of the world&rsquo;s most successful engineering firms, Vi worked alongside him, providing secretarial services and unwavering support. Although her contributions were invaluable, she was characteristically modest about them. With no mention of her own toil and sacrifice, Vi told one journalist, &ldquo;I am so proud of what Joe has accomplished. Every time I look at the name Jacobs Engineering atop the headquarters...I get a thrill.&rdquo; For his part, Jacobs frequently acknowledged that he could not have prospered in life without Vi playing a traditional role by his side. &ldquo;Her faith, pride in me, and respect for me were not something to be trumpeted. They were a given,&rdquo; he wrote.   If Jacobs enjoyed the benefits of having a traditional wife and helpmate in Vi, he discovered a new breed of women in his daughters: Margaret, Linda, and Valerie. Smart and independent, the three grew into political liberals and feminists. In the preface to Jacobs&rsquo; second book, The Compassionate Conservative , the trio wrote, &ldquo;At times, our [family] discussions became loud and heated, with him calling us irrational and us calling him insensitive. During one such battle, he accused us of being opinionated, and we responded, &ldquo;Where do you think we learned it?&rsquo;&rdquo;   Jacobs, cognizant of the pitfalls of forcing offspring into a family business, encouraged his daughters to follow their own passions. With little interest in engineering, Meg became a social worker; Val chose to establish a private practice as a marriage and family counselor; and Linda became an archaeologist and scholar of the Middle East. Gratified that each of their daughters was making her own way in the world, Joe and Vi nonetheless wanted the entire family to participate in one important joint project: in 1989 they established the Jacobs Family Foundation, so that each of the five members of the immediate family could have an equal say in philanthropic matters.   Jacobs&rsquo; alma mater proved a gratifying opportunity for giving. Poly, as Jacobs wrote in his memoir, &ldquo;was primarily for bright disadvantaged kids, as I had been, who would be the hungry entrepreneurs of the future.&rdquo; Linda and her father both ultimately sat on the school&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, and as two-time chair, Joe Jacobs was instrumental in guiding the school through some of its most challenging financial trials. So generous and far-reaching was the family&rsquo;s support that in Changing the World: The First 150 Years , a history of what is now known as the NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering, nine pages are devoted to the topic.   With Linda administering a trust that bears her mother&rsquo;s name and the chairmanship of the family foundation rotating among Val; her husband, Norman Hapke; and their children, the Jacobs family&rsquo;s commitment to bettering the world continues. (Meg passed away in 2012.) In his memoir, Jacobs refers lovingly to his daughters&rsquo; dedication to the human good and the pride that engendered in him. &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s as close an approach to immortality that anyone is allowed,&rdquo; he presciently wrote, &ldquo;and that shall be my epitaph.&rdquo;                                              Galleries                    National Engineers Week Celebration - NYU Heights and NYU Polytechnic School of Engineering Alumni Gathering- February 24, 2015   View Gallery                         News    Posted April 9th, 2015  As Attacks Multiply, AIG CEO Hancock Calls for Stronger Cyber Insurance  New Faculty, New Breakthroughs Posted March 19th, 2015  Lynford Lecturer Eric Schadt Uses Big Data to Construct Predictive Models of Disease That Could Change the Face of Medicine Posted March 17th, 2015  15 Students Awarded SAME Scholarships Posted March 16th, 2015        Cable   News from Cable alumni magazine.
