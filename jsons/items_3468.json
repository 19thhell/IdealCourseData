The Arts &amp; Science faculty community spans three divisions: Humanities, Sciences and Social Sciences; in addition to appointments in their home departments, many of our faculty members hold joint, associated, and affiliated appointments with other Arts &amp; Science departments or other schools at NYU. As members of the Arts &amp; Science community, our tenured faculty are responsible for designing curricula and teaching in both the College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). In this collaborative environment, students at all levels have the opportunity to interact with leaders in their respective fields and to participate in their research.        Teaching and research in the arts and sciences are at the core of any great university. The quality and reputation of our faculty has transformed NYU into a university nationally recognized for its excellence. As leaders in their field, our faculty have had countless publishing successes and been awarded virtually every major academic prize and honor.        Through the generosity of our benefactors, many of our distinguished faculty members are honored with named academic posts. One such honor comes to us from the estate of Julius Silver, which provided NYU, and Arts and Science in particular, with a gift that helps to strength NYU as a whole, but also recognizes some the outstanding scholars in Arts and Science in the form of named chairs, known as the Silver Professorships .        In an effort to expand our network, the FAS Global Distinguished Professorship was created in order to bring the world's leading scholars to the Faculty of Arts and Science. By attracting internationally acclaimed academics whose home institution is outside of the United States, we are taking advantage of the international character of scholarship while also enhancing the global reputation of NYU.
