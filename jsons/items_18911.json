Typically, a student taking a CORE production is involved in every aspect of creating a project - the scriptwriting, producing, directing, shooting, and editing. (A \"Craft\" course, by comparison, concentrates on only one aspect of the project creation as just the directing, just the producing, just the editing, etc.)    All courses are arranged by subject areas and by level: Introductory, Fundamental, Intermediate, and Advanced. Some courses may not be offered in a given academic year. Consult each semester\u2019s schedule for specific information.    Students must complete 4 Core Production courses for a minimum of 20 points. However, only one CORE production course may be taken each semester due to the strenuous nature of these courses.
