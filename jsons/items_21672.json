Both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud technologies and concepts will be covered. By the end of the course, you should have fair amount of knowledge about how to use a Cloud, write applications on Cloud and build your own private Cloud.       The first part of the course covers basic building blocks such as virtualization technologies, virtual appliance, automated provisioning, elasticity, and cloud monitoring. We shall learn these concepts by using and extending capabilities available in real clouds such as Amazon AWS, Google App Engine and OpenStack.       The second part of the course will cover more advanced topics with emphasis on ultra large scale systems, computation models and storage clouds for big data. Example topics are storage cloud, cloud security, Hadoop for Big Data, Network Virtualization (SDNs) and new services leveraging cloud migration. Several real world applications will be covered to illustrate these concepts and research innovations including Facebook Cassandra, Amazon Dynamo, Google Big Table, Hadoop HDFS, Yahoo Zookeeper.        Students will benefit from background in Operating Systems, and object oriented programming such as Java. The students are expected to participate in class discussions, present research papers, and conduct a significant course project.

{"detail": [{"content": "CSCI-GA.3033-011           CSCI-GA.3033-011   Cloud Computing:Concepts & Practice   Sambit Sahu   Graduate Division   Computer Science         Course Description  This is a graduate level course on Cloud Computing with emphasis on hands-on design and implementations. Both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud technologies and concepts will be covered. By the end of the course, you should have fair amount of knowledge about how to use a Cloud, write applications on Cloud and build your own private Cloud.       The first part of the course covers basic building blocks such as virtualization technologies, virtual appliance, automated provisioning, elasticity, and cloud monitoring. We shall learn these concepts by using and extending capabilities available in real clouds such as Amazon AWS, Google App Engine and OpenStack.       The second part of the course will cover more advanced topics with emphasis on ultra large scale systems, computation models and storage clouds for big data. Example topics are storage cloud, cloud security, Hadoop for Big Data, Network Virtualization (SDNs) and new services leveraging cloud migration. Several real world applications will be covered to illustrate these concepts and research innovations including Facebook Cassandra, Amazon Dynamo, Google Big Table, Hadoop HDFS, Yahoo Zookeeper.        Students will benefit from background in Operating Systems, and object oriented programming such as Java. The students are expected to participate in class discussions, present research papers, and conduct a significant course project.

As it continues to grow and dominate, it's creating a demand for professionals who understand its concepts as well as its underlying technology. The School of Engineering is offering a graduate course that will help you do just that.   Cloud Computing - Technologies and Use Cases     A graduate course for current students, applicants for an MS program and non-matriculates, cloud computing is a specialty or skill for those with an interest in computer science or engineering and makes an excellent r\u00e9sum\u00e9 highlight.   Flexible course schedule for Spring 2012, with classes taking place alternate Saturdays 1:15 p.m. - 5:15 p.m., starting 2/4/2012.   1,248 per credit for this 3-credit course, plus a $265 University Fee.     CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP TODAY!   Sign Up    COURSE DESCRIPTION the School of Engineering's graduate course will focus on both IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) and PaaS (Platform as a Service) Cloud paradigms. Starting with a commercially available cloud computing infrastructure, we\u2019ll go through building blocks like virtualization technologies, virtual appliance, automated provisioning, monitoring and security. Using cloud programming APIs (AWS and Google App Engine), we\u2019ll design and develop concepts such as elasticity, monitoring and scalable storage service, as well as design our own cloud-leveraging open source code base. The second part of this course will focus on use cases based on the interest of students in the class. Suggested use cases include Cloud for very large data analytics, large-scale storage and Extreme Scale Cloud. Pre-requisite: Programming experience in Java, Python or Ruby. Experience with web services programming would be helpful in understanding/using Google App Engine.
