This course, taken in the fall semester, is a comprehensive introduction to quantitative research in the social sciences. The course focuses on foundational ideas of sociological research, including strengths and weaknesses of different research designs, interpretation of data drawn from contemporary and historical contexts, and strategies for evaluating evidence. The majority of the course is comprised of two-week units examining particular research designs, with a set of scholarly articles that utilize that design (e.g., experimental designs, with a set of readings that use this method to examine discrimination in labor and housing markets). The course is designed so that students will produce a proposal of their thesis as their final paper.    Techniques of Quantitative Analysis    SOC-GA 1401, 1402 Greenberg, Lee. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The two-semester course in data analysis covers numerous specific statistical tools used in social science research. The course emphasizes the use of statistical software packages in analysis. Students will gain experience with linear regression, probability models, statistical graphics, polynomial models, analysis of multivariate outcomes and repeated measures, and logistic regression. Prerequisite: introductory statistics course that includes linear regression.    Proseminar Workshop    SOC-GA 1501, 1502 Hout. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The seminar is designed to serve multiple sets of student needs. With a focus on presentations from outside speakers and practical training, the seminar will expose students to different methods and practices of sociology. Seminar presentations are given on a wide range of topics by faculty from NYU and other New York City universities, as well as researchers from private, government, and non-profit settings. Some weeks will focus on current research in a particular area or on a particular topic, while other weeks will focus on specific skills (such as a software package) or topic of interest (such as applying to PhD programs).    Data Analysis Workshop    SOC-GA 1903 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course is designed to help AQR students gain experience with \"real-world\" data. Over the course of the semester, students will work collaboratively on a data project, working with either faculty or external organizations on a project of mutual interest, providing students with an authentic experience in data analysis and presentation.    AQR Masters Thesis    SOC-GA 1998 Hout. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. To complete the requirements for the M.A. in Applied Quantitative Research, students will complete an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member in the Department of Sociology (either chosen by the student, or assigned by the AQR program director). Students may also use self-secured internships as fieldwork for their project. The project will involve an original (secondary) analysis of quantitative data to answer a research question constructed by the student (and approved by her/his faculty advisor). A preliminary proposal must be discussed and approved by the faculty advisor. The final project will take the form of a paper that would potentially be appropriate for submission to a scholarly journal in the social sciences.

This course, taken in the fall semester, is a comprehensive introduction to quantitative research in the social sciences. The course focuses on foundational ideas of sociological research, including strengths and weaknesses of different research designs, interpretation of data drawn from contemporary and historical contexts, and strategies for evaluating evidence. The majority of the course is comprised of two-week units examining particular research designs, with a set of scholarly articles that utilize that design (e.g., experimental designs, with a set of readings that use this method to examine discrimination in labor and housing markets). The course is designed so that students will produce a proposal of their thesis as their final paper.    Techniques of Quantitative Analysis    SOC-GA 1401, 1402 Greenberg, Lee. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The two-semester course in data analysis covers numerous specific statistical tools used in social science research. The course emphasizes the use of statistical software packages in analysis. Students will gain experience with linear regression, probability models, statistical graphics, polynomial models, analysis of multivariate outcomes and repeated measures, and logistic regression. Prerequisite: introductory statistics course that includes linear regression.    Proseminar Workshop    SOC-GA 1501, 1502 Hout. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. The seminar is designed to serve multiple sets of student needs. With a focus on presentations from outside speakers and practical training, the seminar will expose students to different methods and practices of sociology. Seminar presentations are given on a wide range of topics by faculty from NYU and other New York City universities, as well as researchers from private, government, and non-profit settings. Some weeks will focus on current research in a particular area or on a particular topic, while other weeks will focus on specific skills (such as a software package) or topic of interest (such as applying to PhD programs).    Data Analysis Workshop    SOC-GA 1903 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. This course is designed to help AQR students gain experience with \"real-world\" data. Over the course of the semester, students will work collaboratively on a data project, working with either faculty or external organizations on a project of mutual interest, providing students with an authentic experience in data analysis and presentation.    AQR Masters Thesis    SOC-GA 1998 Hout. 4 points. 2013-14, 2014-15. To complete the requirements for the M.A. in Applied Quantitative Research, students will complete an independent research project under the direction of a faculty member in the Department of Sociology (either chosen by the student, or assigned by the AQR program director). Students may also use self-secured internships as fieldwork for their project. The project will involve an original (secondary) analysis of quantitative data to answer a research question constructed by the student (and approved by her/his faculty advisor). A preliminary proposal must be discussed and approved by the faculty advisor. The final project will take the form of a paper that would potentially be appropriate for submission to a scholarly journal in the social sciences.
