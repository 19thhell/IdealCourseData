In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

These include calligraphy, ink painting, scroll rendering, landscape sculpture, and birds eye perspective in the present time. Students will examine the content of artwork, including ideas in contemporary and traditional art, both Chinese and international, and build various skills to translate ideas into reality. A journal will be kept to record ideas, sketches, references and future plans. The course includes a study of ancient Chinese paintings, drawings of still-lifes and live models, as well as visits to local artists, galleries, and museums. Class time will be devoted to individual projects and critiques, lectures, and group discussions. As a final project, students will integrate their living experiences in Shanghai with personal experience and/or the societal landscape, to create a substantial body of artwork for a group exhibition. This course is open to students who have an art background or upon the approval of the professors.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

On the basis of reviewing the early encounters between East Asia and America in the 18th and 19th centuries, this course covers the major political, economic, military, and cultural developments, as well as the dynamics underlying them, that have shaped the confrontation and cooperation between various East Asian countries and the United States in the past 100 years. In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.

What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.

Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?                                                                    Linear Algebra I - MATH-SHU 117 - 4 points                               Linear systems appear throughout the applied sciences; examples include chemical equations, electrical networks, and heat distribution. This course covers linear algebra and its applications.

Prerequisite: CCSC-110.                            Social Foundations                                                  Global Cultural Heritage - CCSF-SHU 125 - 4 points                               In this course we explore the special place of &quot;cultural heritage&quot; in global life today. We will trace the journeys of cultural heritage items around the world \u2014 from the war trophies and curiosity cabinets of history, to our modern era\u2019s museums, and the global movements in antiquities, art, and other objects from the global South to collectors and museums in the global North, through looting, smuggling, and trade. Topics we\u2019ll investigate include &quot;biographical objects&quot; and the anthropology and psychology of collecting; the social life of objects of desire; the construction of value and knowledge in the representation and display of such objects; the beginnings of museums and their global spread; the concepts of national and global cultural heritage; as well as a series of ongoing international legal and moral battles over heritage, including cases related to China.                                                                    Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.                                                                      Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

Sample Syllabus                                                                      France and the European Union: Europe in Crisis - EURO-UA 9122 or POL-UA 9523 or FREN-UA 9122 - 4 points                               The purpose of this seminar on European integration is to give the students a few keys in understanding what the European Union is and how it works; how it affects every day policies of the member states as well as the life of European citizens; what kind of world actor the EU is or might become; what political consequences the current financial crisis might have for the EU. Conducted in French.                                                                      Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.                                                                    French Society and Culture from the Middle-Ages to the Present -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09163 - 4 points                               This course approaches the study of French civilization from the medieval period to World War II through an exploration of fine arts, music, philosophy, literature, and history. A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage. Conducted in French.                                                                      Problems in Contemporary French Society -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09965 - 4 points                               The course aims to introduce students to contemporary French society through an examination of particular social groups and categories, with a focus on French youth and notions of gender. Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.                                                                    French-African Relations -\u00a0SCA-UA 9914 or HIST-UA 9510 - 4 points                               A historical and political inquiry into the French system of relations with Francophone Africa from the \u2018race to Empire\u2019 in the 19th century to the current day. The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France. Conducted in French.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.                                 Direct Enrollment at French Partner Universities   NYUParis students may enroll in one or more courses offered at the University of Paris schools with which we have partner agreements (University of Paris I, III, VII, X), and at specialized schools (Institut d\u2019E\u0301tudes Politiques, otherwise known as Sciences Po).   Courses available in English are offered within the Departments of Anglo-American Studies and examine various aspects of culture and civilization of the English-speaking world.    Courses offered in French are selected from the following departments: French and Comparative Literature, History, Art History, Sociology, Studio Art, Cinema, Political Science. Students must either have taken or be currently enrolled in Written Contemporary French to take a course in French at the University of Paris. In addition, students complement their coursework in individualized tutorial sessions with a tutor at NYUParis.     Students may only take courses at the University in which they are administratively enrolled (with the exception of Sciences Po - see below). You will be asked to choose which university you prefer when filling out your visa questionnaire from the Office of Global Services.    Course offerings and schedules at the University of Paris are confirmed later than the in-house courses at NYUParis. Direct enrollment at the University of Paris is therefore handled after students\u2019 arrival in Paris. Further instructions, course offerings and schedules will be communicated during the orientation period in Paris.    Please read the information about each university\u2019s specialty areas below, keeping in mind that you will only be able to take courses at the university for which you are administratively enrolled (see above).

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict?

We will discuss the ways of knowing such as reason, observation, experiment, and modeling. Our topics include science and religion, science and war, and the development of key scientific disciplines, institutions, and forms of communication. While focusing on physical and life sciences we will also ask about connections between a science of things and a science of human beings and human society. Students read original works by Newton, Lavoisier, Darwin, Freud, and Einstein, among others.                                                                    Animals, Nature, Environment - CCST-SHU 130 - 4 points                               This course will explore urgent issues concerning the relation of human civilization to the natural environment in which it is embedded. There are three main components: The first investigates the human relationship with animals, starting from what are the differences between us and animals, and what these differences mean today. Second, we explore broader issues of &quot;nature&quot;: how we humans have conceived of ourselves as distinct from, or even superior to Nature; or, alternatively, enslaved to our inner nature. Third, we study global environmental issues, including how environmentalism emerged in the industrial era, what is its place in today's world, and what the prospects are for finding solutions to the most urgent global problems.                                                                    Serendipity in Science - CCST-SHU 127 - 4 points                               In 1754 the antiquarian Horace Walpole coined the word serendipity based on the Persian fairy tale \u201cThe Three Princes of Serendip,\u201d whose heroes \u201cwere always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of.\u201d In the ensuing centuries,the word has had a colored history. Many of the major scientific and technological developments that shape our modern economy and culture had serendipitous components, including X-rays, penicillin, nylon, vulcanization of rubber, Post-Its, Velcro, saccharin, Nutrasweet, Teflon, insulin, the Pap test, super glue and a host of others. In this course we examine the history of serendipity, the synergism between the scientific background and experience of the individual scientist and researcher, and some of the many serendipitous breakthroughs that have changed and extended our lives and continually improved our standard of living.                                                                    Information Societies - CCST-SHU 129 - 4 points                               Proclamations of the \u201cpersonal computer revolution\u201d and the advent of the \u201cInformation Age\u201d are now history, if only three decades old. Recently developed digital media have also been associated with radical changes and even the \u201cdeath\u201d of traditional forms of communication. This class will evaluate the relationship between information technology and society, \u201cthe media and the message,\u201d from a broad historical perspective. Students will learn about the major material transformations in information support, from scroll to web, with a focus on Western civilization. A comparative attention to the Middle East and East Asia for the Early Modern period and the Soviet political project for twentieth century developments will allow for a more nuanced interpretation of the notion of \u201cmodernity\u201d associated with the \u201cfrom printing press to Internet\u201d narrative arc.  We will build toward an understanding of the interdependencies between technological and social systems in several steps. First, we will establish a longue duree perspective by surveying the scroll-to-codex transformation, and sketch contours of a Eurasian geographical plane by following paper's transition from China to the Middle East and Europe. Next, we will read foundational texts on the history of the printing press with a special focus on transformations in science and religion. We will then overview the famous nineteenth-century developments in information and communication technologies. We will ask about their roles in shaping individuals' gender and professional identities as well as in the governance of transatlantic empires. The emergence of big corporations in parallel with the modern bureaucratic apparatus and new recording and data processing technologies is our fourth step. Toward the end of the class, we look at how the WWII calculating machine, the computer, acquired the functions of a \u201cmedia machine\u201d and took center stage in the debates about alternative political systems. We conclude with an exploration of contemporary visions for blurring space and time, ubiquitous computing, and promises of ultimate technological transcendence: trans-humanism. To preserve a uniting element in this wide ranging material, each of these steps will systematically explore particularly important locations where technological and social changes are negotiated, such as the library, the printing workshop, the publishing house, the office, and, finally, the classroom and the body itself.                          Cultural Foundations                                                  History of Chinese Cinemas - CCCF-SHU 121 - 4 points                               This course, the first segment in a two-semester survey of Chinese-language film history, traces the origins of Chinese cinema and its transformation and diversification into a multi-faceted, polycentric trans-regional phenomenon in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan up to the 1960s. We study a number of film cultures in Shanghai/China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, including the complex web of their historical kinship ties, and place them within the regional and global contexts of modernity, revolution, nation-building, and attendant socio-cultural transformations. To investigate these unique yet interrelated films cultures together raises the question of national cinema as a unitary object of study, while suggesting new avenues for analyzing the complex genealogy of a cluster of urban, regional, commercial or state-sponsored film industries within a larger comparative and transnational framework. Topics related to screenings and discussions include urban modernity, exhibition and spectatorship, transition to sound, stardom and propaganda, gender and ethnic identities, and genre formation and hybridization.                                                                    Masters of Asian Cinema - CCCF-SHU 129 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to the basic concepts and methods in film studies by focusing on a select number of eminent auteurs in Asian cinemas. Our objectives are many: first, we situate within their particular socio-historical contexts the masterworks by master-directors like Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, Wong Kar-wai, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Mani Ratnam, and Deepa Mehta. In doing so, we learn the divergent developments between and within Japanese, Chinese, and South Asian film industries. We then analyze how these directors make various stylistic choices to address issues of kinship, nation, gender, historical memory, modernity, and globalization. Against the background of 20th century cross-cultural encounters, we also study the contributions of these auteurs to world cinemas and the cross-fertilization in style between these film masters.                                                                    Paper Art: History and Practice CCCF-SHU 127 - 4 points                                Beginning with the Chinese arts of Zhezhi (paper folding) and Jianzhi (paper cutting) the paper craft movement has roots on all continents. This course reviews the history of both Chinese and international traditions, in addition to examining contemporary practices. Additionally, students will have hands-on experience through weekly exercises in the fundamentals of paper engineering techniques and basic conductive materials, creating movable books and sculptures.

What ancient principles are preserved? Beginning with early Greek \u201cproto scientific\u201d philosophy we will explore emerging paradigms of science through a consideration and replication of great experiments that had significant impact by changing accepted world views. Before turning to the scientific and ontological revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries we will investigate the assumptions of pre-modern science. Philosophical, religious and scientific arguments will be studied and evaluated. Representative works of Bacon, Descartes, Galileo and Newton will be read to introduce the outlook of early modern science. The course will conclude with a survey of some contemporary scientific theories that evoke the legacy of tradition.  One lecture and laboratory each week. In the lab students will, to the extent possible, replicate classic experiments from the history of science (list and descriptions of experiments in preparation).

In particular, this course aims to help students develop a better understanding of how nations with different values, cultural-historical backgrounds, political institutions, and levels of economic development may coexist in today\u2019s world.                                                                      The Concept of China - GCHN-SHU 110 - 4 points                               From the Warring States period to the present, what have Chinese and others understood to be the meaning of \u201cChina,\u201d and what have been the broad implications of this understanding? This course is divided into four chronological periods: Antiquity\u2014from the period of the \u2018central kingdoms\u2019 to the formation of the early empire; Middle Period\u2014China Among Equals; Early Modern: 1350-1910\u2014China, Global Trade, and Imperialism; Modern: 1910-present\u2014China Redux                                                                      Digital Chinese Humanities - GCHN-SHU 201 - 4 points                               This course introduces students to computational thinking with specific reference to Global China Studies, and provides a foundation for future research. Areas of focus may include the creation, enhancement, and analysis of digitized written texts, especially primary sources; methodologies for the use of the internet as a research and translation tool; the production and processing of photographs: audio recordings: video clips: and geospatial data. Prerequisite: None.                          Humanities                                                  Gender, Sexuality, and Culture - HUMN-SHU 240 - 4 points                               This course invites students to think about some of the most carefully controlled but also fervently sought-after questions since the time of Plato: what is the difference between gender and sex? What is the relationship between our gendered bodies, behaviors, and identities? How does sex, something we do, translate to the discourse of sexuality, something we talk about? What is the measurement of normality? If art indeed imitates and even changes life, in what ways do images of gender performance in literary and visual culture also reproduce and perhaps reshape our own experiences as gendered and sexed beings in a society? What can gender and sexuality tell us about the construction of culture, its boundaries, and its \u201coutlaws\u201d? Through the reading of philosophical, literary, historical, medical, and visual texts, and through discussions of case studies in mass media, we learn to see gender and sexuality as an evolving historical phenomenon rather than essentialist notions. We ask how the development of human interest in sexuality coincides with the burgeoning of governing techniques in modern times to police and promote sex simultaneously\u2014as desirable and useful on the one hand, but also forbidden and harmful on the other. Lastly, as humanists, we ask how the boundary of our body (that is, our inside and outside in the most literal sense) is marked less by our blood cells, skin pores, or molecules than by our use of lan\u00ad\u00adguage.                                                                    Shanghai Stories - HUMN-SHU 266 - 4 points                               This course provides an introduction to the history and culture of Shanghai through the eyes of fiction writers. We will read short stories (in English translation) by Chinese, British, American, Japanese, French, Polish, and South African writers who lived in the city between 1910 and 2010. Their stories will take us on an imaginary city tour through time and space: from businessmen, politicians, and prostitutes gathering in the nightclubs of the old Bund, to Jewish refugees struggling to find a home in the poor shikumen neighborhoods of Hongkou, to teachers and students fighting political battles at the university campuses during the Cultural Revolution, and young urban youth pursuing cosmopolitan lifestyles in the global city of today. The course also includes trips to various places featured in the stories and guest lectures by some of Shanghai\u2019s most famous writers today.                                                                      The Global Economy in the 20th Century - HUMN-SHU 226 - 4 points                               This course explores global economic history from the second industrial revolution and colonial economies of the late nineteenth century to the multipolar globalization of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. It will trace the rise and relative decline of different national economies, especially the United States, and chart how technology, trade, investment, and politics created different economic connections. Topics will include different forms of production, changing cultures of consumption, shifting labor forces, economic crises, and the economic theories such as Keynesianism, neoliberalism, communism, and modernization, which have shaped economies across the long twentieth century.   Jeffrey Frieden\u2019s Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century will be the basic text for the course. Additional articles and book chapters will supplement this book. Excepts from documentaries and feature films on such themes as microcredit, mass consumption and deindustrialization/reindustrialization will be shown.   Students will write two six page papers and have a final exam. In addition, they will be asked to track one country and its changing place and fortunes/misfortunes in the global economy and submit brief reports on that throughout the term. Students will choose a smaller country rather than one of the major global players about whom we will read more extensively. Those reports will be 1-2 pages each and will be submitted every third week of the semester, for a total of 4 reports and a total of 6-8 pages of writing. The final exam will be a mixture of short identifications and two essay questions. A list of 5 essay questions will be given out in advance and on the day of the exam, Professor Nolan will choose the questions on which students will write.                          Interactive Media and Technology                                                    Interaction Lab - INTM-SHU 101 - 4 points                               What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. Conversely excitement about your project ideas for using computation will best propel your acquisition of skills necessary to realize those ideas. This fourteen week course is divided into two parts. The first portion starts with the expressive capabilities of the human body and how we move through the world. The Physical Computing skills will allow you to go past the limitations of the mouse, keyboard and monitor interface and at locations other than the home or the office. The platform for the class is a microcontroller (Arduino brand), a very small inexpensive single-chip computer that can be embedded anywhere and sense and actuate in the physical world. The core technical concepts include digital, analog and serial input and output. The second portion of the course focuses on fundamentals of computer programming (variables, conditionals, iteration, functions, and objects) as well as more advanced techniques such as data parsing, image processing, networking, computer vision, and 3D graphics. The Java-based 'Processing' programming environment is the primary vehicle. Processing is more oriented towards visual displays on desktops, laptops, tablets or smartphones but can also connect back to the physical sensor and actuators from the first part of the class. The course is designed for computer programming novices but the project-centered pedagogy will allow more experienced programmers the opportunity to play further with their project ideas and potentially make friends by helping the other students.                                                                      Rapid Prototyping - INTM-SHU 234 - 4 points                               Beginning with a design problem or challenge, and following a period of analysis and research, a designer can begin to draft, prototype, test, and evaluate possible solutions, often repeating these operations several times until the design reaches maturity. Agile software development methodologies, which involve the formation of self-organized cooperative teams, frequent deadlines with deliverables, and a willingness to accept changing conditions and requirements, have radically changed the way software is being produced. Additionally, new applications, such as Fritzing, 123D Circuits, and Eagle have greatly facilitated the process of electronic circuit design. And Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications, for example Rhinocerous and Tinkercad, and newly available digital fabrication equipment have dramatically quickened the pace with which designers can create physical prototypes. Students in this course will be confronted with a series of design challenges for which they have to propose and prototype possible solutions. The first design challenge will entail the entire class working together to produce a software prototype by adopting agile strategies. The second design challenge will involve students in the process of refining a circuit, and will require bringing a prototype from schematic, to breadboard, perfboard, and finally resulting in a printed circuit board. For the third design challenge, students will explore the use of 3D printers, laser cutters, computer numerical control (CNC) machines, and other tools to produce a physical prototype. Students will then be free to work on a personal design challenge for their final project.                                                                    Sound and Vision - INTM-SHU 212 - 4 points                               In this course students will explore various techniques, both practical and experimental, for sound and video synthesis as it relates to the production of multimedia applications as well as live audio visual performance. Comprehensive practical experience and substantial applied knowledge will be acquired through lectures, coursework, and critique. Students will begin by learning to work with the Max graphical programming environment, which is based on a patch bay metaphor, to produce their own programs (Max patches). Working with Max involves the visual arrangement and interconnection of blocks representing various inputs, outputs, and functions. Through the application of Max\u2019s MSP and Jitter extensions, students will take advantage of the real-time audio and video processing capabilities of the application. Additionally, sound sequencing software, Ableton Live, will be integrated with Max. The application of sound control protocols, such as MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) and OSC (Open Sound Control), will be introduced and investigated. Students will be encouraged to consider new possibilities for input and output afforded by the use of various sensors and actuators with Arduino. Existing off-the-shelf motion controllers, for example the Wii Remote, Microsoft Kinect, and Leap Motion will also be adopted to capture and interpret movement and gesture for the purposes of controlling audio and video. For their final projects, students will create a unique musical instrument. The class culminates in a live performance where students will perform their instruments in front of an enthusiastic audience.

Great Ideas in Mathematics - MATH-SHU 10 - 4 points                               This one semester course serves as an introduction to great ideas in mathematics. During the course we will examine a variety of topics chosen from the following broad categories. 1) A survey of pure mathematics: What do mathematicians do and what questions inspire them? 2) Great works: What are some of the historically big ideas in the field? Who were the mathematicians that came up with them? 3) Mathematics as a reflection of the world we live in: How does our understanding of the natural world affect mathematics (and vice versa!). 4) Computations, proof, and mathematical reasoning: Quantitative skills are crucial for dealing with the sheer amount of information available in modern society. 5) Mathematics as a liberal art: Historically, some of the greatest mathematicians have also been poets, artists, and philosophers. How is mathematics a natural result of humanity's interest in the nature of truth, beauty, and understanding? Why is math a liberal art?                                                                    Linear Algebra I - MATH-SHU 117 - 4 points                               Linear systems appear throughout the applied sciences; examples include chemical equations, electrical networks, and heat distribution. This course covers linear algebra and its applications. Topics discussed include systems of linear equations, matrices and their determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues, quadratic forms, and matrix decompositions, all with a view towards applications. Prerequisite: MATH-SHU 110.                                                                    Probability and Statistics - MATH-SHU 150 - 4 points                               Probability and statistics continue to have increasing relevance in all of the applied sciences.

Prerequisite: CCSC-110.                            Social Foundations                                                  Global Cultural Heritage - CCSF-SHU 125 - 4 points                               In this course we explore the special place of &quot;cultural heritage&quot; in global life today. We will trace the journeys of cultural heritage items around the world \u2014 from the war trophies and curiosity cabinets of history, to our modern era\u2019s museums, and the global movements in antiquities, art, and other objects from the global South to collectors and museums in the global North, through looting, smuggling, and trade. Topics we\u2019ll investigate include &quot;biographical objects&quot; and the anthropology and psychology of collecting; the social life of objects of desire; the construction of value and knowledge in the representation and display of such objects; the beginnings of museums and their global spread; the concepts of national and global cultural heritage; as well as a series of ongoing international legal and moral battles over heritage, including cases related to China.                                                                    Traditional Chinese Wisdom and Its Transformation in Modern Times - CCSF-SHU 122 - 4 points                               This course will give a brief survey of Chinese philosophy from the pre-Qin period to the present in the perspective of world philosophy. To capture the quintessence of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will focus on three most influential schools of thought in ancient China, namely, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism. We will delineate the evolution of Confucianism from Confucius to Neo-Confucianism in Song and Ming dynasties, distinguish Taoism as philosophy from Taoism as religion, and examine the process of sinicization of Buddhism, taking Zen Buddhism as a paradigm case. In modern times, against the background of the exchange between the Chinese and the Western cultures, traditional Chinese wisdom, through the creative work of modern Chinese thinkers, obtained a new lease of life. Under the heading of the modernization of traditional Chinese wisdom, we will examine three most prominent schools in the 20thcentury Chinese philosophy, namely, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, Tsinghua school of realism (the Chinese analytic philosophy), and Chinese Marxism. Students are required to read the assigned texts before each class and actively participate in class discussions. Prerequisite: None.                            Social Science                                                  Introduction to International Politics - SOCS-SHU 160 - 4 points                               What are the causes of war? Why are some countries able to cooperate over issues like trade or the environment, while others are not? What is the role of international organizations and alliances, such as the UN, NATO, and the EU in the international state system? This course will give students an introduction to thinking analytically and systematically about outcomes in the international system, will teach them the prevailing major theories about these issues, and will equip students to begin to formulate their own answers to these questions. Students will learn a set of formal tools to analyze complex world events, which will prepare them for upper level international relations and other social science courses, as well as to become comfortable applying social science methodologies and theories to better understanding the world around us. The class will use some basic math, including introductory game theory, and some background in inferring statistical results will be helpful, but is not required. Over the course of the semester students will be challenged to apply the models and theories from class to real world situations.                                                                      Media and Participation - SOCS-SHU 225 - 4 points                               Making words and images public used to be difficult, complex, and expensive. Now it's not. That change, simple but fundamental, is transforming the media landscape. A publisher used to be required if you wanted to put material out into the public sphere; now anyone with a keyboard or a camera can circulate their material globally. New, cheap forms of communication have opened the floodgates to a massive increase in the number and variety of participants creating and circulating media. This change, enormous and permanent, is driving several effects in the media landscape today.   This course covers the transition from a world populated by professional media makers and a silent public to one where anyone who has a phone or a computer can be both producer and consumer. This change, brought about by the technological and economic characteristics of digital data and networks, is upending old industries -- newspapers, music publishing, moviemaking -- faster than new systems can be put in place. The result is chaos and experimentation as new ways of participating in the previously sparse media landscape are appearing everywhere.   This course will provide a brief history and economics of the previous media landscape, the design of digital networks that upend those historical systems, and new modes of participation for sharing words, images, audio and video. We will look at the dynamics of both English-language services, such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, and, in translation, Chinese-language services such as Sina Weibo, Weixin and QQ.    The class will consist of class discussion around readings and lectures, in-class presentations and analysis of new uses of media that you observe (or participate in) outside class. There will be two written analyses of the media landscape, one at mid-term and one final paper.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture. Taught in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

This course aims to understand and appreciate the creativity and dynamism of the Parisian art scene today through an exploration of contemporary art in the capital. The course will focus on the diversity of resources provided by the city, with special attention to new artistic practices and loci of production, as well as the multiple actors involved, from artists themselves to private galleries to art critics and museum curators. Reference to major avant-garde art movements of the past such as dada, geometrical abstraction, surrealism and expressionism will also be made in order to better situate today\u2019s artistic concerns.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas.

Placing films in their historical and cultural context, we consider how cinema provides a window on French society, while recognizing that they are cultural products specific to a particular historical moment. Social history, cultural archetypes and artistic creation will be some of the topics under consideration. Conducted in English.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

It is organized in survey fashion as a broad introduction to some of the major artistic movements of the past two centuries\u2014symbolism, realism, naturalism, modernism, surrealism, existentialism, and the New Wave of the sixties. Literary texts, both in poetry and prose, will be read in conjunction with the viewing of relevant films. By studying the past history of representations of Paris in literature and film, it is hoped that students will achieve a heightened awareness of the daily life that goes on around them in the present.    Authors to be read include Baudelaire, Huysmans, Zola, Apollinaire, Breton, C\u00e9line, Queneau, and Perec. The movies include works by Bunuel, Vigo, Malle, Godard, Truffaut, and Varda.                                                                      Experimental Theatre Workshop - FREN-UA 9868 - 4 points                               This course is designed to allow students to analyze and reenact excerpts from Moli\u00e8re\u2019s plays. We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings. Conducted in English.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.

A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Theater in the French Tradition - FREN-UA 9929 - 4 points                               In this course we explore contemporary French theatre in relation to the broader tradition of French dramaturgy, to consider how contemporary works both continue and break with the great works of the past. We take as our point of departure the major playwrights of the modern and contemporary period \u2013 Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad \u2013 in order to consider how writers of the 20th and 21st centuries position themselves in relation to the great dramaturges that preceded them -- Corneille, Racine, Moli\u00e8re, Beaumarchais, Hugo. Thus we examine, for example, how Jean-Paul Sartre affirms his place in relation to Corneille but in opposition to Racine, how Cocteau or Giraudoux look to antiquity for inspiration, how Koltes steeps himself in classical tragedy to shape his dramatic vision. Theatre outings constitute a regular feature of the course, allowing us to consider major texts and their realization on stage. Conducted in French.                                                                      Problems in Contemporary French Society -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09965 - 4 points                               The course aims to introduce students to contemporary French society through an examination of particular social groups and categories, with a focus on French youth and notions of gender. Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course. Conducted in French.

The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France.

A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

Prerequisite: Written Contemporary French or permission of the NYU Paris staff.   NYU Paris students with advanced French language skills may attend one to two lecture courses in French at the prestigious Institut d\u2019Etudes Politiques de Paris, more commonly known as Sciences Po. Students wishing to enroll at Sciences Po in Fall 2015 must first submit the following application form to NYU Paris by April 10th, 2015 indicating their year, major, French level (current or most recently completed French language course), and GPA. We will provide deadlines for future semesters at a later date. Students will also be asked to send a short personal statement (1-2 paragraphs) stating their motivations for studying at Sciences Po as part of their application. Upon successful review of their applications, students will be invited to apply to Sciences Po in late April or early May. Application materials for Sciences Po include a transcript, CV, and statement of purpose. Please note that NYU Paris students are not necessarily guaranteed a spot at Sciences Po, so it is in students' best interest to submit a strong application.   Once students are admitted to Sciences Po, they will be able to select their courses over the summer using the Sciences Po online student portal. NYU Paris strongly encourages students admitted to Sciences Po to take only courses in French, and to take no more than 2 courses during the semester (subject to approval). It is expected that most students will take only one course per semester at Sciences Po. In exceptional cases, students may take a course in English upon approval by NYU Paris. A selection of past lecture course offerings is listed below for reference.   Please note: students wishing to attend a course at Sciences Po should enroll administratively at the University of Paris (University of Paris I, III, or VII), but will need to apply separately to Sciences Po in order to take a course at Sciences Po.

Rangan            Prerequisites : Undergraduate linear     algebra.            Linear algebra is two things in one: a general methodology     for solving linear systems, and a beautiful abstract     structure underlying much of mathematics and the sciences.     This course will try to strike a balance between both. We     will follow the book of our own Peter Lax, which does a     superb job in describing the mathematical structure of     linear algebra, and complement it with applications and     computing. The most advanced topics include spectral theory,     convexity, duality, and various matrix decompositions.             Text : Lax, P.D. (2007).

MATH-GA 2150.001 Advanced     Topics in Algebra (Introduction to Algebraic Geometry and     Elliptic Curves)      3 points. Fall term.      Wednesday, 5:10-7:00, A. Pirutka.             Prerequisites : Elements of linear algebra and the     theory of rings and fields.            The objects of study in algebraic geometry are systems     defined by polynomial equations. Here are some examples:      1. x^2+y^2+z^2-w^2=0;      2. y^2=x^3-2x      3. x^2+y^2=u^2, x^2+z^2=v^2, y^2+z^2=w^2, x^2+y^2+z^2=t^2.            The first example gives a projective quadric; the second one     defines an elliptic curve. The rational solutions of the     third one provide a rectangular box such that the lengths of     the edges, face diagonals, and long diagonals are rational     numbers. The existence of such a solution is still not     known.            We will start this introductory course with some topics from     the commutative algebra, such as ideals in polynomial rings     and the famous Nullstellensatz theorem. We will also discuss     some projective geometry in dimension two. A large part of     the course will be devoted to the study of elliptic curves     over various fields: finite fields, fields of rational or     complex numbers. For elliptic curves defined over finite     fields we will discuss as well applications in cryptography.                                                                        MATH-GA     2170.001 INTRODUCTION TO CRYPTOGRAPHY      3 points. Fall term.      Monday, 11:00-12:50, O. Regev.                 Prerequisites : Strong mathematical     background.            The primary focus of this course will be on definitions and     constructions of various cryptographic objects, such as     pseudo-random generators, encryption schemes, digital     signature schemes, message authentication codes, block     ciphers, and others time permitting. We will try to     understand what security properties are desirable in such     objects, how to properly define these properties, and how to     design objects that satisfy them. Once we establish a good     definition for a particular object, the emphasis will be on     constructing examples that provably satisfy the definition.     Thus, a main prerequisite of this course is mathematical     maturity and a certain comfort level with proofs. Secondary     topics that we will cover only briefly will be current     cryptographic practice and the history of cryptography and     cryptanalisys.

This course emphasizes examples,     representation formulas, and properties that can be     understood using relatively elementary tools. We will take a     broad viewpoint, including how the equations we consider     emerge from applications, and how they can be solved     numerically. Topics will include: the heat equation; the     wave equation; Laplace's equation; conservation laws; and     Hamilton-Jacobi equations. Methods introduced through these     topics will include: fundamental solutions and Green's     functions; energy principles; maximum principles; separation     of variables; Duhamel's principle; the method of     characteristics; numerical schemes involving finite     differences or Galerkin approximation; and many more.

Stadler      (fall); Thursday, 5:10-7:00, J. Goodman      (spring).                 Fall Term             Prerequisites : A good background in linear algebra,     and experience with writing computer programs (in MATLAB,     Python, Fortran, C, C++, or other language). Prior knowledge     of MATLAB is not required, but it will be used as the main     language for the course. You encouraged but not required to     learn and use a compiled language.            This course is part of a two-course series meant to     introduce Ph.D. students in mathematics to the fundamentals     of numerical mathematics (but any Ph.D. student seriously     interested in applied mathematics should take it). It will     be a demanding course covering a broad range of topics, both     theoretically and with extensive homework assignments. There     will be a final take-home exam examining a topic of     relevance not covered in the class. Topics covered in the     class include floating-point arithmetic, linear systems,     eigenvalue problems, interpolation and quadrature     (approximation theory), nonlinear systems of equations,     optimization, Fourier transforms, and Monte Carlo methods.     This course will not cover differential equations, which     form the core of the second part of this series, Numerical     Methods II.

Prerequisites : (Serial) programming experience with     C/C++ or FORTRAN (C will mostly be used in class), and some     familiarity with numerical methods.           This class will be an introduction to the fundamentals of     parallel scientific computing. We will establish a basic     understanding of modern computer architectures (CPUs and     accelerators, memory hierarchies, interconnects) and of     parallel approaches to programming these machines (distributed     vs. shared memory parallelism: MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL). Issues     such as load balancing, communication, and synchronization     will be covered and illustrated in the context of parallel     numerical algorithms. Since a prerequisite for good parallel     performance is good serial performance, this aspect will also     be addressed. Along the way you will be exposed to important     tools for high performance computing such as debuggers,     schedulers, visualization, and version control systems.           This will be a hands-on class, with several parallel (and     serial) computing assignments, in which students can and will     have to explore material independently. Students will learn     some Unix in this course.           Text : Rauber, T., &amp; Runger, G. (2013). Parallel                       Programming for Multicore and Cluster Systems (2nd     ed.).

Prerequisites : Derivative     Securities, Scientific Computing, Computing for Finance, and     Stochastic Calculus.            The term \"statistical arbitrage\" covers any trading strategy     that uses statistical tools and time series analysis to     identify approximate arbitrage opportunities while     evaluating the risks inherent in the trades (considering the     transaction costs and other practical aspects). This course     starts with a review of Time Series models and addresses     econometric aspects of financial markets such as volatility     and correlation models. We will review several stochastic     volatility models and their estimation and calibration     techniques as well as their applications in volatility based     trading strategies. We will then focus on statistical     arbitrage trading strategies based on cointegration, and     review pairs trading strategies. We will present several key     concepts of market microstructure, including models of     market impact, which will be discussed in the context of     developing strategies for optimal execution. We will also     present practical constraints in trading strategies and     further practical issues in simulation techniques. Finally,     we will review several algorithmic trading strategies     frequently used by practitioners.

A comprehensive introduction to the theory and     practice of portfolio management, the central component of     which is risk management. Econometric techniques are     surveyed and applied to these disciplines. Topics covered     include: factor and principal-component models, CAPM,     dynamic asset pricing models, Black-Litterman, forecasting     techniques and pitfalls, volatility modeling,     regime-switching models, and many facets of risk management,     both theory and practice.                 Spring Term                Risk Management is arguably one of the most     important tools for managing a trading book and quantifying     the effects of leverage and diversification (or lack     thereof).            This course is an introduction to risk-management techniques     for portfolios of (i) equities and delta-1 securities and     futures (ii) equity derivatives (iii) fixed income     securities and derivatives, including credit derivatives,     and (iv) mortgage-backed securities.            A systematic approach to the subject is adopted, based on     selection of risk factors, econometric analysis,     extreme-value theory for tail estimation, correlation     analysis, and copulas to estimate joint factor     distributions. We will cover the construction of     risk-measures (e,g. VaR and Expected Shortfall) and     historical back-testing of portfolios. We also review     current risk-models and practices used by large financial     institutions and clearinghouses.            If time permits, the course will also cover models for     managing the liquidity risk of portfolios of financial     instruments.

The importance of financial risk management has been     increasingly recognized over the last several years. This     course gives a broad overview of the field, from the     perspective of both a risk management department and of a     trading desk manager, with an emphasis on the role of     financial mathematics and modeling in quantifying risk. The     course will discuss how key players such as regulators, risk     managers, and senior managers interact with trading.     Specific techniques for measuring and managing the risk of     trading and investment positions will be discussed for     positions in equities, credit, interest rates, foreign     exchange, commodities, vanilla options, and exotic options.     Students will be trained in developing risk sensitivity     reports and using them to explain income, design static and     dynamic hedges, and measure value-at-risk and stress tests.     Students will create Monte Carlo simulations to determine     hedge effectiveness. Extensive use will be made of examples     drawn from real trading experience, with a particular     emphasis on lessons to be learned from trading disasters.             Text : Allen, S.L. (2003).

MATH-GA 2797.001 CREDIT MARKETS     AND MODELS      3 points. Fall term.      Wednesday, 7:10-9:00, Instructor TBA.           Prerequisites : Computing in     Finance (or equivalent), Derivative Securities (or     equivalent), familiarity with analytical methods applied to     interest rate derivatives.            This course addresses a number of practical issues concerned     with modeling, pricing and risk management of a range of     fixed-income securities and structured products exposed to     default risk. Emphasis is on developing intuition and     practical skills in analyzing pricing and hedging problems.     In particular, significant attention is devoted to credit     derivatives.            We begin with discussing default mechanism and its     mathematical representation. Then we proceed to building     risky discount curves from market prices and applying this     analytics to pricing corporate bonds, asset swaps, and     credit default swaps. Risk management of credit books will     be addressed as well. We will next examine pricing and     hedging of options on assets exposed to default risk.            After that, we will discuss structural (Merton-style) models     that connect corporate debt and equity through the firm\u2019s     total asset value. Applications of this approach include the     estimation of default probability and credit spread from     equity prices and effective hedging of credit curve     exposures.            A final segment of the course will focus on credit     structured products. We start with cross-currency swaps with     a credit overlay. We will next analyze models for pricing     portfolio transactions using Merton-style approach. We also     will discuss portfolio loss model based on a transition     matrix approach. These models will then be applied to the     pricing of collateralized debt obligation tranches and     pricing counterparty credit risk taking wrong-way exposure     into account.

Spring term.      Monday, 1:25-3:15, C.      Fernandez-Granda .             Prerequisites : Basic knowledge of probability and     linear algebra.             In recent years, optimization-based techniques have had     a major impact in two areas of data analysis: inverse     problems and statistical estimation in high-dimensional     spaces. The main principle underlying these techniques is to     exploit nonparametric prior knowledge about the data by     solving tractable optimization problems. Some representative     examples include sparse regression analysis of genomic data,     compressed sensing in medical imaging and signal processing,     and low-rank models in recommender systems and computer     vision. This course provides an introduction to     optimization-based methods by describing the theoretical     tools used to analyze them, the computational algorithms     developed to implement them and some of their main     applications.

Topics to be covered include (but are not     limited to): the advective derivative, momentum conservation     and continuity, the rotating Navier-Stokes equations and     non-dimensional parameters, equations of state and     thermodynamics of Newtonian fluids, atmospheric and oceanic     basic states, the fundamental balances (thermal wind,     geostrophic and hydrostatic), the rotating shallow water     model, vorticity and potential vorticity, inertia-gravity     waves, geostrophic adjustment, the quasi-geostrophic     approximation and other small-Rossby number limits, Rossby     waves, baroclinic and barotropic instabilities, Rayleigh and     Charney-Stern theorems, geostrophic turbulence. Students     will be assigned bi-weekly homework assignments and some     computer exercises, and will be expected to complete a final     project. This course will be supplemented with out-of-class     instruction.             Recommended Texts : Vallis, G.K. (2006).

Tuesday, 1:25-3:15, O.     Pauluis .           What effects the large scale circulation of the     atmosphere? Like the antiquated heating system of     a New York apartment, solar radiation unevenly warms the     Earth, leading to gradients in energy in both altitude and     latitude. But unlike the simple convection of air in     your drafty home, the effects of rotation, stratification, and     moisture lead to exotic variations in weather and climate,     giving us something to chat about over morning coffee... and     occasionally bringing modern life to a standstill.           The goals of this course are to describe and understand the     processes that govern atmospheric fluid flow, from the Hadley     cells of the tropical troposphere to the polar night jet of     the extratropical stratosphere, and to prepare you for     research in the climate sciences. Building on your     foundation in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, we will explore how     stratification and rotation regulate the atmosphere's response     to gradients in heat and moisture. Much of our work will     be to explain the zonal mean circulation of the atmosphere,     but in order to accomplish this we\u2019ll need to learn a great     deal about deviations from the zonal mean: eddies and     waves. It turns out that eddies and waves, planetary,     synoptic (weather system size) and smaller in scale, are the     primary drivers of the zonal mean circulation throughout much,     if not all, of the atmosphere.           There will also be a significant numerical modeling component     to the course. You will learn how to run an atmospheric     model on NYU's High Performance Computing facility, and then     design and conduct experiments to test the theory developed in     class for a final course project.

Amidst the shouting over climate change and what action should     be taken about it, this course seeks to focus in on the     science of climate prediction. We will work our way through     the components of state-of-the-art climate models, endeavoring     to understand, or at least appreciate, the science and     approximations that lie behind predictions of future climate     change. The course will proceed in seminar format.     Participants will be expected to read background material on     climate models and complete a research oriented project,     running and/or analyzing the output from an IPCC class climate     model. No experience in climate modeling is required, but a     basic knowledge of fluid dynamics and physics will help.           Our goal is to work through the key components of a climate     model. The Earth\u2019s climate is determined by interactions     between the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere (ice sheets,     glaciers, sea ice) and land surfaces (terrestrial hydrology,     biology, etc.). This course will be biased towards the     atmospheric component of a climate model, but we will seek to     understand how interactions between the atmosphere and the     other elements of the climate system are represented in     models.

To understand the behavior of a deterministic or random     dynamical system, it is often useful to find and study     stationary regimes or invariant distributions, since they     govern long-term statisticalproperties of the system. From     this point of view, existence and uniqueness of invariant     distributions and, more generally, description of all     invariant distributions along with convergence to     equilibrium become important questions that this course will     be centered around.            The course will begin with a discussion of deterministic     dynamics, then proceed to Markov processes and random     dynamics. The state space      for Markov processes will be consecutively assumed to be     finite, countable, finite dimensional, infinite dimensional,     and appropriate methods and notions will be discussed such     as compactness, Krylov--Bogolyubov method, coupling,     regularity conditions of minorization type, Doeblin and     Harris conditions, strong Feller property, Lyapunov     functions, asymptotic strong Feller property, asymptotic     coupling, one force -- one solution principle. In the end of     this course, these notions will be applied to stochastic     PDEs such as stochastic Navier--Stokes system and stochastic     Burgers equation.            Good knowledge of probability and measure theory is required     (at the level of Probability: Limit Theorems 1). No     knowledge of ergodic theory, dynamical systems, or Markov     processes will be assumed (although acquaintance with those     subjects will make the course more meaningful). A     significant amount of time in this course will be devoted to     material that may be viewed as preparatory.
