Students are expected to present a project description on the first day of class. Wearable technologies have slowly come to maturity over the past few years. Conductive fibers and textiles, mini-arduinos and the lilipad, new power sources, as well as new ways of looking at modules and how these can be arranged, open up the space for more expressive possibilities. Still, there are many technical as well as conceptual, design and social challenges that mire the way. A number of technical subjects are covered that relate specifically to wearable technologies, drawing on existing designs and their application to students' projects. Technical subjects to be addressed may include the design of power sources suitable for wearable and portable applications, low-power design and construction techniques, creating soft electrical connectors, switches, and circuits, and the selection and sourcing of e-textiles. Students are expected to come with a project in mind and bring it to completion by the end of the semester. In the process they will present their progress and technical innovation during the semester and receive technical and design guidance in a collaborative environment that will seek solid solutions and robust concepts.
