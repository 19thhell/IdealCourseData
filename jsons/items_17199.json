The program has a strong foundation in traffic engineering, transportation planning, transportation economics, public transportation systems, and intelligent transportation systems. To ensure that you are immediately productive upon graduation, you will tackle projects you will face on the job and work hands-on with modern tools, including, but not limited to Synchro and SIM-Traffic and other simulation programs, HCS+, AutoCAD templates for intersection design, and data collection and processing software.   The program includes a strong focus on the rapidly emerging field of intelligent transportation systems. This field applies telecommunications and information technology to solving a variety of transportation functions, from route guidance systems to automated toll collection systems to the automated highway.   Admission Requirements   You must hold at least a baccalaureate degree from an acceptable institution. You must also have a firm background in quantitative analytic skills. If admitted, students lacking such skills must take remedial courses in addition to degree requirements to strengthen their analytic competency.   In addition, you must show evidence of quantitative analytic ability, generally including a minimum of 2 years of college mathematics. A college-level course in statistics is desirable.   Finally, all foreign students admitted to the program must take an examination in English before registration. Based upon an evaluation of the examination, you may be required to take up to 2 additional courses in English as a Second Language (ESL) for which no graduate credit is given.

Accidents paralyze long stretches of freeway, rush hour congestion slows traffic to a crawl, and crowded intersections can become an obstacle course for pedestrians. Traffic engineers understand how highly functional roads and highways ease such frustrations. It&rsquo;s their job to properly design and manage our traffic systems, to act as the caretakers of our cities&rsquo; economic and social health.   The Certificate in Traffic Engineering program trains our students to become those caretakers. As one of the world&rsquo;s busiest and most populous regions, the New York City metro area provides a natural testing ground for the study of traffic systems. Our curriculum focuses on urban freeway and intercity networks, the management of arterial and street space, and the design and control of intersections. It also introduces you to the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its increasing importance in the field of traffic engineering.   Whether you&rsquo;re a working professional or a student seeking a highly focused, part-time course of study, our certificate provides specialized knowledge that you can apply immediately in the field. You&rsquo;ll also have the foundation to pursue further studies in the future: each of our courses can be transferred to an advanced degree program.   Admission Requirements   Applicants may be students with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees seeking to specialize in an aspect of transportation or those with advanced degrees wishing additional course work in a highly focused area of the profession.   You may apply for transfer to degree programs without any loss of credits, assuming you are admitted to the degree program and that the courses are related to the degree. Admission to this certificate program does not guarantee admission to a full degree program.                                    Program Manager        Elena S.

Parking serves as the primary access interface to many land facilities, from shopping centers and sports facilities, to medium- and high-density residential developments. The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. TR-GY 7343 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Multimodal Transportation Safety TR-GY 7033 Technology, legislation and market forces have contributed to improved transportation safety for decades. But one must consider which metrics are most relevant for which modes, the role of demographics and traffic levels and other factors when analyzing and predicting safety trends. The course pays attention to a systems view, to metrics by mode and to both standard field and statistical analyses. Consistent with current priorities, the course addresses security as well as safety issues. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Applications TR-GY 6223 This course introduces the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its growing role in the management of transportation systems. The course stresses the role of ITS as national policy, as specified in major transportation funding legislation \u2013 ISTEA, TEA21 and SAFETY-LU. A systems engineering approach to overall development of ITS technologies is stressed. Major components of ITS are discussed, and examples of their application treated. Coordination and integration of ITS components are treated. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.

Required Courses   TR-GY 6013 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6313 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) TR-GY 6323 ( Please refer to the bulletin )     Select 1    3.00 Credits Design of Parking & Terminal Facilities TR-GY 7323 This course covers design techniques and approaches to a variety of pedestrian and vehicular needs in conjunction with access to land functions. Parking serves as the primary access interface to many land facilities, from shopping centers and sports facilities, to medium- and high-density residential developments. The planning and design of parking facilities, and the planning of access and egress from these facilities, is critical to the economic success of a development. Terminals are inter-modal interface facilities involving the transfer of people and/or goods from one mode of transportation to another. This course covers essential elements of terminal planning and design, including transit stations and terminals, major goods terminals at ports and railheads and others. The design of pedestrian space and ways within terminal structures is also treated Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. TR-GY 7343 ( Please refer to the bulletin ) 3.00 Credits Multimodal Transportation Safety TR-GY 7033 Technology, legislation and market forces have contributed to improved transportation safety for decades. But one must consider which metrics are most relevant for which modes, the role of demographics and traffic levels and other factors when analyzing and predicting safety trends. The course pays attention to a systems view, to metrics by mode and to both standard field and statistical analyses. Consistent with current priorities, the course addresses security as well as safety issues. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor. 3.00 Credits Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Applications TR-GY 6223 This course introduces the concepts and applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and its growing role in the management of transportation systems. The course stresses the role of ITS as national policy, as specified in major transportation funding legislation \u2013 ISTEA, TEA21 and SAFETY-LU. A systems engineering approach to overall development of ITS technologies is stressed. Major components of ITS are discussed, and examples of their application treated. Coordination and integration of ITS components are treated. Prerequisite: Graduate status or permission of instructor.
