Business analytics unlocks the predictive potential of data analysis to improve financial performance, strategic management, and operational efficiency.     Gain a Competitive Advantage  Graduates will be equipped to influence decision-making, strategy and ultimately drive better business results by gaining the ability to transform data into a powerful and predictive strategic asset. Business Analytics is critical in preparing organizations to solve 21st-century business challenges and participants of this program will have exposure to innovative methodologies that support data driven decision making.     What Differentiates this Program?     APPROACH: The NYU Stern Master of Science in Business Analytics, an advanced business degree program, teaches students both to understand the role of evidence-based data in decision making and to leverage data as a strategic asset. The program is designed for experienced professionals interested in gaining competitive advantage through the predictive potential of data.     FORMAT: The Master of Science in Business Analytics program is a one year long, part-time program divided into five on-site class sessions (modules) at NYU Stern in New York and other rotating global locations. This part-time format reduces the absence from the office to approximately 5 weeks over the course of the year. Between modules, students complete an average of 20-25 hours per week of work via distance learning. For more information on the format, please click here .     NETWORK: Participants have the opportunity to cross-learn and share best practices among their cohort and through their exposure to top faculty and business leaders in the growing field of Business Analytics. With a degree from New York University, graduates will join NYU\u2019s extensive global alumni network.     APPLICATION: The culmination of the program is the Business Analytics Capstone, which gives students an opportunity to apply the learnings of the program by presenting a unified and practical case on a topic of their choosing. This is a team based project with approximately 4-5 students per group.     NYU STERN: New York City is one of the world's great financial and business capitals, and NYU Stern is in the middle of it all. Close to Wall Street, located in the heart of Greenwich Village, NYU Stern is one of the world's leading research institutions. Academic excellence is always a top priority at NYU Stern.

APPROACH: The NYU Stern Master of Science in Business Analytics, an advanced business degree program, teaches students both to understand the role of evidence-based data in decision making and to leverage data as a strategic asset. The program is designed for experienced professionals interested in gaining competitive advantage through the predictive potential of data.     FORMAT: The Master of Science in Business Analytics program is a one year long, part-time program divided into five on-site class sessions (modules) at NYU Stern in New York and other rotating global locations.
