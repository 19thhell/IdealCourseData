Goldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Program as well as the Rhodes Scholarship . Through this support, the Honors Program hopes to increase its students&rsquo; ability to secure additional support for the cost of their education. Students interested in these prestigious awards are encouraged to speak to the Office of Undergraduate Academics who will assist them with their application.   Other scholarships of interest, the Soros Fellowship for New Americans, the SMART Scholarship and scholarships offered by the Society of Women Engineers are also detailed below.   Additionally, all students are encouraged to consult the School of Engineering&#39;s list of private scholarships for additional funding for their education.   Rhodes Scholarship   The Rhodes Scholarships, the oldest international educational fellowships, were initiated after the death of Cecil Rhodes in 1902, and bring outstanding students from many countries around the world to the University of Oxford. American Rhodes Scholars are selected through a decentralized process by which regional selection committees choose 32 Scholars each year representing the fifty states and the District of Columbia.   Extraordinary intellectual distinction is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for election to a Rhodes Scholarship. Selection committees are charged to seek excellence in qualities of mind and in qualities of person which, in combination, offer the promise of effective service to the world in the decades ahead. The Rhodes Scholarships, in short, are investments in individuals rather than in project proposals. Accordingly, applications are sought from talented students without restriction as to their field of academic specialization or career plans, although the proposed course of study must be available at Oxford, and the applicant&rsquo;s undergraduate program must provide a sufficient basis for study in the proposed field. Through the years, Rhodes Scholars have pursued studies in virtually all of the varied fields available at the University of Oxford. Election to the Scholarship is normally for two or three years, depending upon the degree program pursued by the Scholar.   All educational costs, such as matriculation, tuition, laboratory and certain other fees, are paid on the Scholar&rsquo;s behalf by the Rhodes Trustees. Each Scholar receives in addition a maintenance allowance (the stipend) adequate to meet necessary expenses for term-time and vacations. The Rhodes Trustees cover the necessary costs of travel to and from Oxford, one time each way. They do not pay for passports or visas, which are now required for overseas students studying at Oxford.   At the time of application, an applicant must be:      a citizen of the United States; pending citizenship does not qualify.    at least 18 but not yet 24 years of age (i.e., the applicant must still be 23 on October 1 in the year of application).    sufficiently advanced academically to assure completion of a bachelor&rsquo;s degree before October 1 in the year following election.     Additional information about the scholarship can be found on the Rhodes website . Further detailed information on Rhodes and Oxford can be found in their brochure .   Other Scholarships of Interest for the School of Engineering students   The Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans   About the Donors   Paul and Daisy Soros, Hungarian immigrants and American philanthropists, established their fellowship program for New Americans in December 1997 with a charitable trust of fifty million dollars. Their reasons for doing so were several. They wished to &quot;give back&quot; to the country that had afforded them and their children such great opportunities and felt a fellowship program was an appropriate vehicle. They also felt that assisting young New Americans at a critical point in their education was an unmet need. Finally, they wished to signal to all Americans that the contributions of New Americans to the quality of life in this country have been manifold.   Central to an understanding of the entire Program is an understanding of the donors, Paul and Daisy Soros. Assisting young New Americans in pursuing their life chances in this country is an autobiography of their lives - where friends, family and associates helped them as they built a life in this new land.   Fellowship Application Process   Deadlines for applications are November 1st of the given year; we encourage candidates to submit and get their collateral material to us before that date. Life being as it is in universities, however, there is a crush of material to us. Letters of recommendation are often late, making a full consideration more difficult. Once the application and other materials are in hand, teams of at least three readers consider the candidacy and determine who will be invited for interviews. Like every strong fellowship program, the Soros Fellowships have many more able people applying than can ever be invited for interviews. Painful though the decision process is, 84 are eventually invited. The interviews are held in January in New York and Los Angeles, with a February announcement.   Expectations of Fellows If someone is successful in receiving the Soros Fellowship, what is expected? In addition to the frequent e-mail and correspondence so that the Program can get maintenance checks to the Fellows and half-tuition to the university, the obligations are four-fold. First, the Program Director will expect at least once in the Fellowship period to visit the Fellow&#39;s institution to see how things are going, meet with the dean, financial aid officer, and major professor. Whenever the Director visits a campus, a dinner is usually held for all the Fellows in the area (i.e., Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington) and it is hoped all Fellows can manage to attend. Second, each year the Fellow is expected to forward to the New York office a copy of the transcript. Third, twice in the Fellowship, the Fellow is expected to attend a Fall Conference in New York City, where all the Fellows have a chance to meet each other and the Soroses and members of our National Advisory Council, share views on such common concerns as immigration and human rights, and visit key cultural places in the City (usually the Metropolitan Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, and a Broadway show). The Program pays for transportation and accommodations. Finally, at the end of Fellowship, each Fellow is asked to write an &quot;end-of-Fellowship&quot; report. While not &quot;required,&quot; it is hoped that all Fellows will keep in touch with the Program office and each other through the newsletter and the website chatroom.   TO APPLY: Application materials are available online here , with full information on the Fellowships available here . Applications must be completed and sent in no later than November 1st. The announcement of awards is in February.   SMART Scholarship (Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation)   The Science, Mathematics And Research for Transformation (SMART) Scholarship for Service Program has been established by the Department of Defense (DoD) to support undergraduate and graduate students pursuing degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. The program aims to increase the number of civilian scientists and engineers working at DoD laboratories. All applicants are required to submit applications online by 5:00 P.M. EST, December 14, 2012.   Awardees must be:      a U.S. citizen at time of application,    18 years of age or older as of August 1, 2013,    able to participate in summer internships at DoD laboratories,    willing to accept post-graduate employment with the DoD,    a student in good standing with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale (as calculated by the SMART application) and,    pursuing an undergraduate or graduate degree in one of the disciplines listed on the About SMART page.     Additional requirements:   *Undergraduate applicants must be currently enrolled in a regionally accredited U.S. college or university and have a high school diploma/GED. Current high school students are not eligible to apply.   **Graduate applicants can be either currently enrolled in a regionally accredited U.S. college or university or awaiting notification of admission to such. If awaiting admission, you must be accepted for entrance in the fall 2013 term.   *Freshman/First Year Associate&rsquo;s Program applicants must report an ACT or SAT Reasoning Test Score. Subject tests are not required.   **Graduate applicants must have taken the GRE and test scores must be reportable by ETS. Subject tests are not required.   Participants in the SMART Program will receive:      Full tuition and education related fees (does not include items such as meal plans, housing, or parking)    Cash award paid at a rate of $25,000 - $41,000 depending on prior educational experience (may be prorated depending on award length)    Paid summer internships    Health Insurance reimbursement allowance up to $1,200 per calendar year    Book allowance of $1,000 per academic year    Mentoring    Employment placement after graduation     The Society of Women Engineers (SWE)   The SWE Scholarship Program provides financial assistance to women admitted to accredited baccalaureate or graduate programs, in preparation for careers in engineering, engineering technology and computer science. In fiscal year 2010, SWE disbursed more than 170 new and renewed scholarships valued at almost $500,000.   Grants are announced in the summer (sophomore, junior, senior and graduate students) and late summer/early fall (freshmen and re-entry students) for use during the following academic year. Grant payments are made in the fall for corporate-sponsored scholarships and in both the fall and spring for endowed scholarships, upon proof of registration.

Selection committees are charged to seek excellence in qualities of mind and in qualities of person which, in combination, offer the promise of effective service to the world in the decades ahead. The Rhodes Scholarships, in short, are investments in individuals rather than in project proposals. Accordingly, applications are sought from talented students without restriction as to their field of academic specialization or career plans, although the proposed course of study must be available at Oxford, and the applicant&rsquo;s undergraduate program must provide a sufficient basis for study in the proposed field. Through the years, Rhodes Scholars have pursued studies in virtually all of the varied fields available at the University of Oxford. Election to the Scholarship is normally for two or three years, depending upon the degree program pursued by the Scholar.   All educational costs, such as matriculation, tuition, laboratory and certain other fees, are paid on the Scholar&rsquo;s behalf by the Rhodes Trustees. Each Scholar receives in addition a maintenance allowance (the stipend) adequate to meet necessary expenses for term-time and vacations. The Rhodes Trustees cover the necessary costs of travel to and from Oxford, one time each way. They do not pay for passports or visas, which are now required for overseas students studying at Oxford.   At the time of application, an applicant must be:      a citizen of the United States; pending citizenship does not qualify.    at least 18 but not yet 24 years of age (i.e., the applicant must still be 23 on October 1 in the year of application).    sufficiently advanced academically to assure completion of a bachelor&rsquo;s degree before October 1 in the year following election.     Additional information about the scholarship can be found on the Rhodes website . Further detailed information on Rhodes and Oxford can be found in their brochure .   Other Scholarships of Interest for the School of Engineering students   The Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans   About the Donors   Paul and Daisy Soros, Hungarian immigrants and American philanthropists, established their fellowship program for New Americans in December 1997 with a charitable trust of fifty million dollars. Their reasons for doing so were several. They wished to &quot;give back&quot; to the country that had afforded them and their children such great opportunities and felt a fellowship program was an appropriate vehicle. They also felt that assisting young New Americans at a critical point in their education was an unmet need. Finally, they wished to signal to all Americans that the contributions of New Americans to the quality of life in this country have been manifold.   Central to an understanding of the entire Program is an understanding of the donors, Paul and Daisy Soros. Assisting young New Americans in pursuing their life chances in this country is an autobiography of their lives - where friends, family and associates helped them as they built a life in this new land.   Fellowship Application Process   Deadlines for applications are November 1st of the given year; we encourage candidates to submit and get their collateral material to us before that date. Life being as it is in universities, however, there is a crush of material to us. Letters of recommendation are often late, making a full consideration more difficult. Once the application and other materials are in hand, teams of at least three readers consider the candidacy and determine who will be invited for interviews. Like every strong fellowship program, the Soros Fellowships have many more able people applying than can ever be invited for interviews. Painful though the decision process is, 84 are eventually invited. The interviews are held in January in New York and Los Angeles, with a February announcement.   Expectations of Fellows If someone is successful in receiving the Soros Fellowship, what is expected? In addition to the frequent e-mail and correspondence so that the Program can get maintenance checks to the Fellows and half-tuition to the university, the obligations are four-fold. First, the Program Director will expect at least once in the Fellowship period to visit the Fellow&#39;s institution to see how things are going, meet with the dean, financial aid officer, and major professor. Whenever the Director visits a campus, a dinner is usually held for all the Fellows in the area (i.e., Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington) and it is hoped all Fellows can manage to attend. Second, each year the Fellow is expected to forward to the New York office a copy of the transcript. Third, twice in the Fellowship, the Fellow is expected to attend a Fall Conference in New York City, where all the Fellows have a chance to meet each other and the Soroses and members of our National Advisory Council, share views on such common concerns as immigration and human rights, and visit key cultural places in the City (usually the Metropolitan Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, and a Broadway show). The Program pays for transportation and accommodations. Finally, at the end of Fellowship, each Fellow is asked to write an &quot;end-of-Fellowship&quot; report. While not &quot;required,&quot; it is hoped that all Fellows will keep in touch with the Program office and each other through the newsletter and the website chatroom.   TO APPLY: Application materials are available online here , with full information on the Fellowships available here . Applications must be completed and sent in no later than November 1st. The announcement of awards is in February.
