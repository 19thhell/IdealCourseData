Bio:   In a former life, I studied Economics in Cairo and upon graduating, worked as an economist for an oil company for a couple of years there. Then, upon reading a historical novel set in medieval Cairo, I saw the light and discovered a deep passion for medieval history. That conversion led me back to graduate school in Cairo, Cambridge (UK), and Princeton (US).      My research explores the social history of religion\u2014how religious identity structured people\u2019s lived experience, but also how their social practices challenge and complicate the picture of inter-religious relations as represented in normative sources (theological, legal, and polemical).     My book, Converting Cultures in Medieval Cairo (forthcoming) examines the late-medieval mass conversions from Coptic Christianity to Islam\u2014most likely the moment when Egypt became a majority Muslim region. This pivotal process was unique in that it occurred almost seven centuries after the Arab-Muslim conquests. It involved many converts who changed their religious identity\u2014but, perhaps more importantly, it also had deep and long-term effects on the religious traditions of Coptic Christianity and Islam. This transformation\u2014slow to emerge but thorough once complete\u2014continues to cast a long shadow on sectarian relations/tensions in modern Egypt, as well as on both communities\u2019 imagined ethnicities.      Since arriving at NYU, I have been fortunate to teach various courses on medieval history. My undergraduate courses include a lecture survey ( The Making of the Muslim Middle East, 600- 1100 A.D. , part of the MAP program) and thematic seminars, like Conversion & Apostasy in the Middle Ages and Christians of the Nile: Coptic History .     My graduate courses include textual and reading skills colloquia e.g. (a) Everyday Life in Medieval Cairo , which introduces students to medieval Arabic documents, including hands-on training in paleography; and (b) The World of the Geniza, where students learn Judeo-Arabic and explore material from the Cairo Geniza, a trove of documents from Egypt\u2019s medieval Jewish community, including unusual genres like personal/merchant letters; charity petitions; marriage contracts and trousseau lists.

Bio   Karl Appuhn\u2019s research examines the relationship between humans and non-human nature in early modern Italy. He is most interested in the ways that technical and scientific expertise helped individuals and institutions make sense of the connections between society and nature. He has written about forest and water management in Renaissance Venice, and is currently working on a history of veterinary medicine in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Italy, which examines the connection between widespread zoonotic diseases (especially bovine diseases), changes in the Italian diet, and the establishment of veterinary medicine as an academic discipline at the University of Padua. He is also writing a general environmental history of early modern Europe.     His book, A Forest on the Sea won the American Historical Association\u2019s Herbert Baxter Adams Prize for best first book in European history, as well as the Weyerhaeuser Prize for best book in conservation history and the Delmas Prize for best book in Venetian studies. He also won the ASEH\u2019s Hamilton Prize for best article in the field of environmental history in 2000. He is the recipient of fellowships from Fulbright, ACLS, the Columbia Society of Fellows in the Humanities, the American Academy in Rome, the Institute for Advanced Study, and the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation.     He teaches graduate and undergraduate courses in Italian history, environmental history, the history of science and medicine, the history of animals, and Mediterranean history. He has worked closely with graduate students in early modern and modern European history, Atlantic World, Latin American history, African history, U.S. history, the joint MEIS and HJS programs, and the Italian Studies department.
