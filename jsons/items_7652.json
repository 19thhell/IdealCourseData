Grifo, MD, PhD   The combination of academic, scientific and technical expertise found in our division has created one of the most respected fertility programs and clinical divisions in the country. Our reproductive endocrinologists and physician-scientists are actively engaged in research, both clinical and basic, as well as training residents and fellows in this specialized field. Our clinical work includes some of the world\u2019s finest technicians and physicians who have pioneered new innovations and been honored for their outstanding contributions to the field of reproductive medicine.   Our Role in Research   Research has played a major role in our division throughout its existence and serves as an important part of our commitment to furthering patient care. It has enabled our staff to pioneer new innovations in areas such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), blastocyst culture and oocyte freezing and helped us to secure NIH grant funding for current studies. Our physicians have published hundreds of papers on infertility and the surgical research conducted in the laboratories at the NYU Fertility Center . Our members are regularly invited to discuss their research nationally and internationally, sharing their part in the work that has made NYU Langone Medical Center a premiere research institution.   Our Role in Education   Our reproductive endocrinologists introduce medical students to the field, provide residents with further training in infertility and participate in an accredited fellowship program. Clinical and research experience in the field are both provided in a private office setting at NYU Fertility Center , with limited involvement at Tisch and Bellevue hospitals.   Medical Students: We provide didactic lectures and occasionally serve as preceptors for the medical students during their 6-week clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology . In addition, there is a four-week elective course students may choose to master the evaluation and management of the clinical disorders of reproductive endocrinology.   Residents: ObGyn residents rotate through our division in their second year when they spend one month learning how to compile a work-up of the infertile couple and studying the various medical and surgical treatments of infertility, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies. We also provide didactic lectures throughout the four-year residency program. Learn more about the residency program in obstetrics and gynecology .   Fellows: Laboratory and clinical research are combined with clinical training as we prepare fellows for their roles as reproductive endocrinologists. Our three-year program is accredited by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology and leads to board certification in reproductive endocrinology. Learn more about the fellowship program in reproductive endocrinology and infertility .   Our Role in Patient Care   With us, your care is in the hands of a team of experts \u2013 physicians and embryologists whose skill and dedication result in pregnancy rates that are among the highest in the country.
