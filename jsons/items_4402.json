To achieve the first two objectives, guest speakers will be invited to talk about specific topics, including the history, society and culture, religion, indigenous and contemporary health and political systems and their relevance in contemporary Ghana. These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country.

Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

Our focus shall be on developing a grasp of the rudiments and general mechanics of the writer's craft, while at the same time allowing for a fuller realization of the personal/individual creative impulse and talent. Some class sessions will be devoted to various types of writing exercises, others to the discussion of sample texts, most of it produced by members of the class. Each student will be expected to share his/her work with the class and possibly with a wider audience when possible. At the end of the semester, each student will be expected to have produced a substantial body of creative writing for assessment by the course instructors.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

Finally the course explores the relationship between communities and social change. Teaching will be in the form of lectures, discussions, and class presentations.   Sample Syllabus                                Sociology                                                  Globalization and the Developing World - SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               Globalization has become a buzzword in our time. Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

PROGRAM SUMMARY   Located in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, Ghana stands out as one of the most politically and economically stable as well as culturally vibrant countries on the continent. The capital city of Accra is an intriguing blend of successful modernity and rich colonial history.   Journalism in Ghana is an intensive six-week experience in immersion journalism. Students actively participate in reporting, writing, photographing, or filming almost every day. The schedule is rigorous. The program is designed for undergraduate students from NYU and other colleges, but graduate students from the NYU Journalism program may apply to take the Independent Study course. Visiting graduates are welcome to apply to the program's undergraduate courses, but must realize that courses are for undergraduate credit. Visiting students cannot register for the Independent Study. Students who wish to develop their reporting pieces further after returning to the U.S. will have the opportunity to do so.            ACADEMICS      All undergraduate students register for 8 points. The program is designed for undergraduate students but graduate students from the NYU Journalism program may apply. Visiting graduate students are welcome to apply but must realize that courses are for undergraduate credit. Classes are taught at the NYU Accra Center, where students have access to a well-equipped computer laboratory. Before traveling to Ghana, students are expected to attend a pre-departure orientation to learn more about Ghana, the local culture, and the program's requirements, including the material to bring along and be aware of.            HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Students live in NYU housing located in residential neighborhoods within walking distance of the NYU Academic Center. Shuttle service is provided. A weeknight only meal plan is included in the housing and is not optional.            EXCURSIONS   In addition to exploring Accra, students visit Kumasi, which boasts the world's largest outdoor market and has for three centuries been the royal city of the legendary Ashanti tribe. Students also visit Cape Coast and Elmina castles, sites of the country's largest centers for the slave trade.             UNDERGRADUATE COURSES       Undergraduate students must register for 8 points.       PLEASE NOTE: JOUR-UA 101 - Journalistic Inquiry (or the equivalent) is a prerequisite for participation in the program.                                                    JOUR-UA 9204 - Elective Reporting Topics: Reporting Africa - Edozien - 4 Points                               Students report in teams and individually, on political, economic, and social issues in Ghana. The goal is to produce publishable works of journalism, the best of which may be published on the Journalism Department's website. Past projects have picked up for publication by media outlets. Print and broadcast projects are both welcome. This is an intensive reporting experience. Students will be working on their projects every day. Sample syllabus.                                                                  JOUR-UA 9503 - Journalism and Society: Cultural Context of African Media - Staff - 4 Points                               This course will take a critical look at how the media interrelates with society by focusing on the history, content, economics and effects of the media.     The class will explore the socio-cultural and philosophical context of the media industry in general, and the practice of mass communication in Africa and Ghana in particular. This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. Discussions will also deal with how the mass media impact on society and affect the manner in which people experience the world around them. Sample syllabus.

To achieve the first two objectives, guest speakers will be invited to talk about specific topics, including the history, society and culture, religion, indigenous and contemporary health and political systems and their relevance in contemporary Ghana. These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country.

Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

PROGRAM SUMMARY   Located in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, Ghana stands out as one of the most politically and economically stable as well as culturally vibrant countries on the continent. The capital city of Accra is an intriguing blend of successful modernity and rich colonial history.   Journalism in Ghana is an intensive six-week experience in immersion journalism. Students actively participate in reporting, writing, photographing, or filming almost every day. The schedule is rigorous. The program is designed for undergraduate students from NYU and other colleges, but graduate students from the NYU Journalism program may apply to take the Independent Study course. Visiting graduates are welcome to apply to the program's undergraduate courses, but must realize that courses are for undergraduate credit. Visiting students cannot register for the Independent Study. Students who wish to develop their reporting pieces further after returning to the U.S. will have the opportunity to do so.            ACADEMICS      All undergraduate students register for 8 points. The program is designed for undergraduate students but graduate students from the NYU Journalism program may apply. Visiting graduate students are welcome to apply but must realize that courses are for undergraduate credit. Classes are taught at the NYU Accra Center, where students have access to a well-equipped computer laboratory. Before traveling to Ghana, students are expected to attend a pre-departure orientation to learn more about Ghana, the local culture, and the program's requirements, including the material to bring along and be aware of.            HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Students live in NYU housing located in residential neighborhoods within walking distance of the NYU Academic Center. Shuttle service is provided. A weeknight only meal plan is included in the housing and is not optional.            EXCURSIONS   In addition to exploring Accra, students visit Kumasi, which boasts the world's largest outdoor market and has for three centuries been the royal city of the legendary Ashanti tribe. Students also visit Cape Coast and Elmina castles, sites of the country's largest centers for the slave trade.             UNDERGRADUATE COURSES       Undergraduate students must register for 8 points.       PLEASE NOTE: JOUR-UA 101 - Journalistic Inquiry (or the equivalent) is a prerequisite for participation in the program.                                                    JOUR-UA 9204 - Elective Reporting Topics: Reporting Africa - Edozien - 4 Points                               Students report in teams and individually, on political, economic, and social issues in Ghana. The goal is to produce publishable works of journalism, the best of which may be published on the Journalism Department's website. Past projects have picked up for publication by media outlets. Print and broadcast projects are both welcome. This is an intensive reporting experience. Students will be working on their projects every day. Sample syllabus.                                                                  JOUR-UA 9503 - Journalism and Society: Cultural Context of African Media - Staff - 4 Points                               This course will take a critical look at how the media interrelates with society by focusing on the history, content, economics and effects of the media.     The class will explore the socio-cultural and philosophical context of the media industry in general, and the practice of mass communication in Africa and Ghana in particular. This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. Discussions will also deal with how the mass media impact on society and affect the manner in which people experience the world around them. Sample syllabus.

To achieve the first two objectives, guest speakers will be invited to talk about specific topics, including the history, society and culture, religion, indigenous and contemporary health and political systems and their relevance in contemporary Ghana. These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

It considers both traditional aspects of life and how people live their lives in this first decade of the new millennium. How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class.

Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

PROGRAM SUMMARY   Located in West Africa on the Gulf of Guinea, Ghana stands out as one of the most politically and economically stable as well as culturally vibrant countries on the continent. The capital city of Accra is an intriguing blend of successful modernity and rich colonial history.   Journalism in Ghana is an intensive six-week experience in immersion journalism. Students actively participate in reporting, writing, photographing, or filming almost every day. The schedule is rigorous. The program is designed for undergraduate students from NYU and other colleges, but graduate students from the NYU Journalism program may apply to take the Independent Study course. Visiting graduates are welcome to apply to the program's undergraduate courses, but must realize that courses are for undergraduate credit. Visiting students cannot register for the Independent Study. Students who wish to develop their reporting pieces further after returning to the U.S. will have the opportunity to do so.            ACADEMICS      All undergraduate students register for 8 points. The program is designed for undergraduate students but graduate students from the NYU Journalism program may apply. Visiting graduate students are welcome to apply but must realize that courses are for undergraduate credit. Classes are taught at the NYU Accra Center, where students have access to a well-equipped computer laboratory. Before traveling to Ghana, students are expected to attend a pre-departure orientation to learn more about Ghana, the local culture, and the program's requirements, including the material to bring along and be aware of.            HOUSING &amp; MEALS       All students participating in the program are required to live in NYU-provided housing. Students live in NYU housing located in residential neighborhoods within walking distance of the NYU Academic Center. Shuttle service is provided. A weeknight only meal plan is included in the housing and is not optional.            EXCURSIONS   In addition to exploring Accra, students visit Kumasi, which boasts the world's largest outdoor market and has for three centuries been the royal city of the legendary Ashanti tribe. Students also visit Cape Coast and Elmina castles, sites of the country's largest centers for the slave trade.             UNDERGRADUATE COURSES       Undergraduate students must register for 8 points.       PLEASE NOTE: JOUR-UA 101 - Journalistic Inquiry (or the equivalent) is a prerequisite for participation in the program.                                                    JOUR-UA 9204 - Elective Reporting Topics: Reporting Africa - Edozien - 4 Points                               Students report in teams and individually, on political, economic, and social issues in Ghana. The goal is to produce publishable works of journalism, the best of which may be published on the Journalism Department's website. Past projects have picked up for publication by media outlets. Print and broadcast projects are both welcome. This is an intensive reporting experience. Students will be working on their projects every day. Sample syllabus.                                                                  JOUR-UA 9503 - Journalism and Society: Cultural Context of African Media - Staff - 4 Points                               This course will take a critical look at how the media interrelates with society by focusing on the history, content, economics and effects of the media.     The class will explore the socio-cultural and philosophical context of the media industry in general, and the practice of mass communication in Africa and Ghana in particular. This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. Discussions will also deal with how the mass media impact on society and affect the manner in which people experience the world around them. Sample syllabus.
