Founded in 1955 with funds from millionaires down to the humble trishaw rider, we began as Nanyang University, a university created by the people, for the people. The 200 hectare residential campus, located in the south-western part of Singapore, provides a high-quality global education to more than 23,000 undergraduates and 10,000 graduate students. The student body includes top scholars and international olympiad medallists from the region and beyond. The original Yunnan Garden campus is now a cosmopolitan hub and NTU has a presence in other parts of Singapore, and in China, Europe, India and the United States. We aspire to nurture entrepreneurial leaders through a broad education in diverse disciplines. Today, we are ranked among the top 26 technology universities in the world and well within the top 100 among comprehensive universities.\" - Nanyang Technological University                                 Term Dates                                        Fall Semester (Semester 1): early August to early December    Spring Semester (Semester 2): mid-January to mid-May     Note: Dates are approximate and may be subject to change                                 Approximate Living Expenses                                        Housing: On-campus accommodation ranges between S$225 \u2013 350/month (varies by room type)    Food approximately: S$300 - S$400/month    Books and Necessary Class Materials: approximately S$200-500/semester    Local Transportation: S$100 - S$150/month    Personal Expenses: S$200-400/month    Insurance: All exchange students are required to purchase the NTU Group Hospitalisation &amp; Surgical Insurance (GHSI) approximately S$40 per semester     Note: S$ = Singapore Dollar                                 Language of Instruction                                    English                                 Housing                                    On-campus accommodation is limited.

Whether you're looking to experience a new culture, learn a new language, deepen your knowledge of an particular area, or all of the above, Summer Abroad offers students an immersive experience outside of the stresses of the normal semester.   NYU's Summer Abroad programs vary greatly \u2013 by program, location, and academic offerings \u2013 but one thing is certain: as a Summer Abroad student with NYU, you will have access to the full range of resources that are the hallmark of NYU's global network. You'll have a hands-on experience, living and learning in which ever city you choose, and learning and exploring with NYU faculty and students.
