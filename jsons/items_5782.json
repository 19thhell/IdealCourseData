The conference, which explored the rise of algorithms as an object of scholarship, policy, and practice, was also co-sponsored by the Intel Science &amp; Technology Center for Social Computing.   The two-day event kicked off on Thursday afternoon with two opening talks. Robert E. Tarjan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University, discussed \u201cAlgorithms as a Computer Scientist Sees Them,\u201d exploring the algorithm in history, math, and computer science. Claudia Perlich, the Chief Data Scientist at m6d described \u201cHow Big Data touches YOU \u2013 tales from the digital advertising world.\u201d   Friday began with introductory remarks from Helen Nissenbaum , Professor of Media, Culture and Communication, and Computer Science, and Director of the ILI. Malte Ziewitz, a post-doctoral fellow at the ILI and MCC shared the motivation for the conference itself, highlighting a few curious features of algorithms as the subject and object of analysis, and explaining the format of the day\u2019s four panels: Each primary speaker presented a written response to a \u201cprovocation piece\u201d on algorithms; two other scholars responded to this primary work with thoughts of their own.   Tarleton Gillespie of Cornell University began the first panel with a presentation of his essay, \u201cThe Relevance of Algorithms.\u201d Gillespie explored various dimensions of \u201cpublic relevance algorithms\u201d \u2013 those algorithms that increasingly determine \u201crelevant\u201d information, \u201ca crucial feature of our participation in public life.\u201d Kate Crawford of the ILI, as well as of Microsoft Research/University of New South Wales responded with ten vignettes that illustrate the question of whether or not an algorithm can be \u201cagnostic.\u201d Martha Poon, of the London School of Economics and Political Science, responded with a discussion of commercial algorithms, noting different categories of algorithms that may be deployed for profit.   Frank Pasquale, then of Seton Hall Law and now at the University of Maryland Law School, presented \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s New Codes: Reputation and Search Algorithms in the Finance Sector.\u201d This work is related to Pasquale\u2019s forthcoming book, The Black Box Society: Technologies of Search, Reputation, and Finance (under contract with Harvard University Press). In his talk, Pasquale offered a normative framework for the evaluation of algorithms, exploring three financial contexts: consumer credit scoring, financial modeling, and high-frequency trading. Pasquale challenges \u201cadvocates of algorithmic finance\u201d to justify features of its use. IBM researcher Moritz Hardt responded with an interesting presentation on how computer scientists might account for fairness in algorithmic design, and Tal Zarsky of the University of Haifa law school offered a critique of the paper that drew from law and economic analysis. Katherine Strandburg, professor at NYU Law, moderated the panel and discussion.   The afternoon began with Lucas Introna of Lancaster University Management School, who presented on \u201cAlgorithms, Performativity and Governability.\u201d Introna explored different \u201cactor[s] in the dance of agency,\u201d observing that the code of an algorithm is distinct from its \u201cdoing,\u201d or performance. Lisa Gitelman, NYU professor of English and Media, Culture, and Communication, and Matthew Jones, a historian of science at Columbia University, offered stimulating responses.   Daniel Neyland of Goldsmiths, University of London, presented his work on \u201cBearing Accountable Witness to the Ethical Algorithm\u201d in the final full panel. In it, Neyland details his rich experience exploring the ethics of designing a CCTV system. Mike Ananny, of the University of Southern California and Karrie Karahalios, of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, responded with rich discussion of how we might frame ethical questions related to algorithms.   The conference concluded with Evgeny Morozov, author of To Save Everything, Click Here , and Paul Dourish of the University of California, Irvine, each offered concluding thoughts on the two-day event, noting common themes, additional implications, and alternative ways of framing or analyzing many of the issues discussed at the conference.   Audience members came from all over the United States and Europe to attend, forging interesting interdisciplinary connections.
