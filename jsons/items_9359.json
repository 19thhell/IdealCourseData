The course gives due attention to other relevant figures, such as Gokhale, Tilak, Jinnah, and Nehru in the case of India; Li Hongzhang, Sun Yatsen, Chen Duxiu, La Dazhao, and Chiang Kai-shek in the case of China; and Phan Boi Chau in the case of Vietnam.    Seminar: Cold War in Asia   EAST-UA 552 Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on U.S. foreign policy in Asia since 1945. The ways U.S. global interests and concerns sought to shape Asian realities (and were shaped in turn by them) are the touchstone for examining the Cold War in Asia. We examine the following topics: the occupation of Japan and early U.S. global economic visions; the U.S. and the Chinese revolution before the Korean War; the Korean War and the isolation of China; the Vietnam War and the Kennedy/Johnson years; Nixon's global geopolitical vision and his policies towards Vietnam, China, and Japan; Carter and the meaning of human rights diplomacy in Asia; Reagan and the Asian issues involved in an intensified Cold War against Russia; George H.

Cultures of National Division: The Koreas and Others   EAST-UA 567 4 points.   Asks how the fact of national division, as the founding moment of the postwar Korean states, has affected the way that national life is lived and narrated. It examines the myriad ways in which division has been formulated in literature, film, historiography, and popular discourse. Topics covered include gendered tropes of division, imagined reunifications, and division in the global culture industry. The main focus is on the two Koreas, but also looks comparatively and historically at the experiences of East/West Germany and India/Pakistan.    History of Modern Korea   EAST-UA 609 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Starting in the late 19th century, and proceeding through the colonial period (1910\u201345), national partition (1945), the Korean War (1950\u201352), and the establishment of a \"division system,\" we look at how various writers wrote about and mobilized around issues of national sovereignty, class and gender, and democracy, issues that many saw as structurally linked. Reading primary and secondary sources on modern Korean history, we also locate the issues being addressed within a broader, East Asian/global context, to better understand how and to what extent texts, practices, and ways of seeing and remembering were shaped by and were reactions to colonialism, the Korean War, the Cold War, and late capitalism.    Korean Modernism   EAST-UA 610 4 points.   Considers the problem of colonial modernism through a close reading of literary and other cultural texts from early 20th-century Korea. Asks what it means to enter modernity under colonial rule by questioning the relationship among imperialism, writing, and subjectivity in particular.

Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 613 Offered every year. 4 points.   Examines key theoretical and methodological issues in the study of Japanese cinema, such as the connections between Japanese films and cultural traditions, the effect of Americanization and modernization, the formation of national identity and specificity, and the \"otherness\" of Japanese cinematic form.    Japanese Cinema in the International Context   EAST-UA 614 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Studies Japanese cinema from a comparative perspective, examining the interactions between Japanese and non-Japanese film authors. Cross-cultural interactions, translations, and creative \"misunderstandings\" are analyzed by comparing films from a variety of national cinemas, historical periods, and genres.

Aesthetics and Politics of Vision in Premodern Japan   EAST-UA 615 Looser. 4 points.   Offers a broad cultural history of Japan, roughly from the eighth century through the mid-19th. The focus is on visual regimes\u2014differing conventions and practices of seeing\u2014and on changing roles for what is now thought of as aesthetics; these visual regimes are then taken as a means of understanding fundamental transformations in structures of power, community, and subjectivity. Draws on a range of materials, from literature to landscape gardens, visual arts, architecture, and technologies, as well as on a diversity of disciplinary perspectives.    New Japanese Cinema   EAST-UA 616 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Focuses on Japanese cinema from 1989 to the present, or the so-called \"new Japanese cinema.\" Major questions considered include why Japanese cinema has succeeded in reinventing itself after 20 years of hiatus; how the resurgence of genres such as yakuza movies and J-horror has contributed to the reinvention; who are some of the major players of the new cinema; what specific roles socioeconomic conditions have played in the radical transformation of Japanese cinema; and how globalization is fundamentally affecting the production, distribution, and consumption of films in Japan now. Students closely watch and analyze films by Takeshi Kitano, Takashi Miike, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Shinji Aoyama, Shinya Tsukamoto, Hirokazu Kore-eda, Hideo Nakata, Takashi Shimizu, and other directors.    Approaches to Chinese Cinema   EAST-UA 618 Button. 4 points.   The development of the cinema in 20th-century China is inextricably linked to the emergence of the modern Chinese nation-state. As early as the 1920s, film became a vital and influential site of cultural production. This course emphasizes the thematic, cultural, and historical content of films, as well as formal issues of filmmaking techniques. All periods of Chinese film are explored, from the earliest Chinese cinema to contemporary fifth- and sixth-generation film, Hong Kong, and contemporary transnational Chinese cinema.    Mass Culture: Japan   EAST-UA 707 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at transformations in the basic terms and conditions of mass culture in Japan, largely from the early 20th century to life in Japan today. It includes considerations of differing theoretical positions on mass culture, everyday life, and modernity in Japan. Materials taken up in the course include examples from cinema, animation, literature, and theatre, as well as new media and the fine arts. Although the focus is on Japan, a comparative perspective with the rest of Asia and with the West is retained throughout.    Japanese Animation and New Media   EAST-UA 708 Looser. 4 points.   Looks at the terms and conditions of Japanese animation (primarily, though not exclusively, anime) as, in many ways, a new and unique mode of expression. Examines the ways in which anime might, or might not, shift earlier modes of expression (both literary and animated): the prevalence of mythology in animation and the tension between mythology and ideology; the importance of genre; and the impact of \"old\" and \"new\" media on narrative structure and reception. Implications of these conditions for thinking about \"Japanese\" culture are also considered.    Anime   EAST-UA 709 Yoshimoto. 4 points.   Introduces students to the rich world of Japanese animation or anime, its form and style, history, popular genres and themes, major authors, and fan culture. Explores the popularity of anime in relation to the cultural conditions of contemporary Japan and that of the world.    Topics in Japanese Literature   EAST-UA 719 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Modern Japanese Literature in Translation II   EAST-UA 721 4 points.   Exposes students to some of the most provocative and entertaining novels written in Japanese since the end of the Second World War. Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic.

Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.

Students see how the collapse of totalizing ideologies brought by Japan's defeat led to an extremely fertile, yet somewhat atomized, literary landscape. In this new postwar terrain, it became increasingly difficult to think of literature in terms of \"schools\" or \"influences,\" as questions of cultural and individual identity became harder and harder to answer in a world of material prosperity and cultural hybridization.    Readings in Chinese Philosophy and Culture   EAST-UA 722 Formerly Introduction to the Civilization of Imperial China. Roberts. 4 points.   Covers Chinese thought during the period ca. 500 B.C.E. to 280 C.E., starting from the era of Confucius (d. 479 B.C.E.) down to the unification of the realm in 206 B.C.E., the pre-imperial period that is also known as the warring states. During this time the main schools of Chinese philosophy (except Buddhism) were established. For this portion of the course, we read seven original works in translation. We begin with the Analects to establish the key elements of Confucius' ethical and political philosophy and to explore the implications of his main philosophical terms. We then proceed to examine his critics and followers: the utilitarian Mozi, the metaphysicians Laozi and Zhuangzi, and the legalist Han Feizi are the critics. Mencius elaborates the thought of Confucius, and Xunzi is both a follower and a critic. This brings us to the transition (ca. 200 B.C.E.) from the pre-imperial to the imperial periods. The course ends with two historical readings: Sima Qian's Record of the Historian (excerpts) and the novel The Three Kingdoms. The former addresses the moment of transition and the establishment of the Qin and Han dynasties; the latter chronicles the fall of the Han dynasty some four centuries later in 220 C.E. and the reconstitution of a unified realm in 280 C.E.    Historical Epics of China and Japan   EAST-UA 726 Roberts. 4 points.   Mainly, a comparative study of four major narratives. We compare two military epics of China and Japan, The Three Kingdoms and The Tale of the Heike; and then two romantic epics, The Tale of Genji and The Dream of Red Mansions. These four readings (of which The Tale of Genji alone was written by a woman) are thematically central to their respective cultures. The military epics raise crucial questions about the nature of dynastic rule and the qualifications for kingship, about the relationship of the ruling dynasty to the territory and the people that it rules, and about how diplomatic and military strategies interact. The romantic epics deal with the intrigues of the royal court and the noble elite, the observations and roles of the female characters, and the problem of generational continuity. The course begins with two short readings: the Vietnamese national classic, Tale of Kieu, which is based on Chinese works, and the Chinese fantasy travelogue Monkey (abridged). Confucianism, Buddhism, and Daoism play a large role in these complex narratives, and due attention is given to how the ideals and doctrines of these three ways of thinking inform the motives and the fates of the characters and the larger design of the authors.    Topics in East Asian Classics   EAST-UA 728 Offered every two years. 4 points.   Topics vary semester by semester.    Traditional Drama of China &amp; Japan   EAST-UA 729 Roberts. 4 points.   Compares a set of Chinese and Japanese pre-modern dramas, mainly as literature but also as performance, by exploring the contrasts and parallels of incident, character, plot design, and theme of the two theatrical traditions. Attention is given to the historical background of each work and to the social conditions and customs that each reflects. The cultural salience of each work is also considered. Where possible and appropriate, scenes or entire plays are screened for the class or assigned for viewing.    20th-Century Chinese Literature in Translation   EAST-UA 731 Offered every year. 4 points.   Explores the changing trends in literary writing and how it relates to the social and historical contexts of the period. Students study the literature to reflect on the culture and self-understanding of modern China.    Japan Through Its Literature   EAST-UA 734 No knowledge of Japanese required. Roberts. 4 points.   Introduces undergraduate students to approximately 10 major Japanese literary works, starting with the 11th-century Tale of Genji, which became a national classic. We go on to read the Zen diary Essays in Idleness, texts of Noh plays, the Chushingura, and plays of Chikamatsu. In the second half of the course, we read a series of modern novels starting with Ukigumo (Japan's first modern novel), followed by The Broken Commandment, Sound of the Mountain, and The Waiting Years. Brief response papers to each reading are required, in addition to exams and a longer paper.    Vietnam: Its History   EAST-UA 737 Identical to HIST-UA 737. Offered every year. 4 points.   Focuses on the American War in Vietnam\u2014its origins, its development, and the ways it was fought. It examines how and why American geopolitical and military strategies led to, and shaped, the course of the war. Historical accounts are regularly supplemented with a reading of parts of the Pentagon Papers and an oral history of those involved in the Vietnam War as told from all sides.The course begins by examining Vietnamese cultural and national identity and the impact of French colonialism. We then examine in greater detail the following topics: the war from 1946-54 between the French and the Viet Minh; the early American OSS links with Ho Chi Minh and the reasons for the Truman administration's deepening commitments to the French; the policies of the Eisenhower administration\u2014from Dien Bien Phu and the Geneva Conference in 1954 to the decision to back Ngo Dien Diem; the deepening commitment of the Kennedy administration; the escalating war of the Johnson years; and the end of the war under Nixon and Ford. We conclude by discussing the legacies of the war and interpretations of them.    United States in Korea, 1945\u2013Present   EAST-UA 741 4 points.   Undertakes an examination of both modern Korea and of the U.S. role in Korea. Those who see South Korea as an American success story assume that the United States created and maintained the conditions for South Korea's security, democracy, and economic prosperity. Others point out that the United States bears considerable responsibility for the partitioning of Korea after 1945, creating the conditions for the Korean War and four decades of authoritarian rule. By examining the histories of resistance and collaboration during the Japanese colonial period, revolutionary movements that preceded the Korean War, and South Korean nationalism and the struggle for democracy, this course provides a deeper understanding of both modern Korean history and the history and culture of American intervention in Korea/East Asia. The Korean War EAST-UA 742 Offered every other year. 4 points. Often referred to as the \u201cForgotten War,\u201d the Korean War (1950\u20131953) was horrific in its violence and profoundly consequential for Korea, East Asia, and the United States. In the United States, this war is remembered as an instance of American rescue that subsequently enabled South Korea\u2019s ascendancy. What is not remembered is that it was the United States that divided Korea along the 38th parallel in 1945. What happened between 1945 and 1948 when U.S. forces occupied southern Korea and the Soviet Army occupied northern Korea? To what degree was the Korean War a denouement of conflicts stemming from Japanese colonial rule? How did a civil war get transformed into an international conflict between the North Korean People\u2019s Army and the Chinese Volunteers against the South Korean Army and the U.N. forces led by the United States? What impact did this war have on the two Koreas, East Asia, and the United States?    Introduction to Buddhism   EAST-UA 832 Identical to RELST-UA 832. 4 points.   See description under Religious Studies.    Topics in Asian Studies   Topics vary from semester to semester.    Internship   EAST-UA 980, 981 Offered every semester. 2 or 4 points per term.    Independent Study   EAST-UA 997, 998 Offered every semester. 2 or 4 points per term.

We find ourselves stretched between the past and the future, flung into a world we did not create and yearning for something better. We have expectations of the world and even fantasies of other ones. Our thought often transcends this world, leaving reality behind. The stories we tell of other, better worlds can often be critiques of our own, whereas sometimes we develop and implement projects for the transformation of this world and even of ourselves. Our goal is to demonstrate the ongoing conversation and practice of utopia in Western (i.e, ancient Greek and Roman, Western Mediterranean Christian, European, and Euro-American) cultural history. In examining some parts of this complex and at times contradictory tradition we will develop a set of questions which can be asked of utopian literature. We also examine our own relationship to this literary, ethical, and political tradition.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Objectivity Prof. Gitelman (English) and Prof. Robles (Media, Culture &amp; Communication)   syllabus  Bias. Spin. Propaganda. Hype. These are familiar pejoratives for citizens of the twenty-first century, and by implication they privilege the same alternative: objectivity. Objectivity is a concept\u2014or an ideal\u2014that frames our understanding of pursuits as diverse as politics, journalism, and science, realms in which we hope to be able to discern the right, the true, and the real. But what is objectivity? Whose discernment counts as objective? How can we tell? Questions like these ask us to consider not only what we know but also how, while the conditions of evolving, possessing, and assessing knowledge turn out to be remarkably available to cultural and historical change. We consider the origins and character of objectivity within and against the Western intellectual tradition by considering selected episodes in its emergence, both ancient and modern, asking how thinkers have thought about knowing. What are or have been the available routes to certainty? What standards exist or have existed for knowledge about the past, about the self or about others, and about the world around us? Is it possible that the twenty-first century will involve new forms of objectivity? Readings: Matthew, Thucydides, Plato\u2019s Protagoras and Meno, Descartes\u2019 Discourse on Method, selections from Montaigne, Bird\u2019s Sheppard Lee, Agee and Evan\u2019s Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Beasts and Books Prof. Kay (French)   syllabus According to the Book of Genesis, human beings have two distinct relationships with other animals: in one version of the creation story Adam gives them names, in the other they are created to keep him company. Whether non-human animals are creatures to which we assign meanings, or whether they are our interlocutors, is thus a dilemma formulated from the outset. It will provide the overall framework for this course in we examine how animals are interpreted metaphorically or symbolically, as if they were texts, and how they are also represented as speaking to us, as if they were producers of texts. We work mainly on written documents ranging from the Bible and antiquity through the Middle Ages and the premodern period (mainly the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries), reaching forward occasionally into the contemporary world for current examples. Some materials are literary (like fables and fairy stories), some philosophical, others historical. We also consider visual materials from manuscript illuminations to recent films. And we evaluate the role of animals in cultural practices other than literary or artistic works\u2014for instance, in hunting or in zoos\u2014and discover how, in this sense, they are like texts that we can read and analyze. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Animal Humans Prof. Lezra (Comparative Literature)  syllabus  \"One might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep its animalness\u2026\" So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how, and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn? With what consequences for our \"human\" understanding of the world? Of concepts like the \"soul,\" \"society,\" politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawn differently in different genres--in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings, films? We come at these questions from different angles, following them from antiquity to early modern responses to these questions, and in essays by contemporary philosophers and advocates. Readings: Genesis, Numbers, Euripides' Bacchae, Plato's Phaedrus, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Apuleius' Golden Ass, Marie de France' Bisclavret, Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream, Montaigne's \"Apology in Defense of Raymond Sebond, Machiavelli's Prince, H. G. Wells's Island of Dr. Moreau and Island of Lost Souls, Derrida's \"The Animal that therefore I am,\" selections from Boccaccio, Peter Singer, Giorgio Agamben, Donna Haraway. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gerety (Collegiate Professor)   syllabus  What   is the soul? Is it the conscious self or something more? Does our   identity persist beyond death? What is the relation between the soul and   good and evil? Some say that Socrates 'discovered' the human soul, but   the idea that we have souls that outlast our bodies is as old as   humanity. Our understanding of the nature of our souls often dictates   the way we feel we should live. We will explore ideas from Homer and   Heraclitus through Socrates himself and then on to Sophocles, Plato,   Aristotle, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament (including the Gnostics),   Augustine, and Vergil. We look for the elements that make up personal   identity and value in the ancient world, both religious and secular, and   see how much these change from Homer's world to that of Augustine and   the Roman Empire. We then turn to Dante, who provides a bridge to some   of the great thinkers and artists of the Renaissance--most notably   Shakespeare and DaVinci but also Montaigne and Villon. In all of these,   the permanence and even presence of our souls seem more uncertain, more   threatened by death and obliteration, than in Plato or Paul, and this   threat reaches our morality and values as well. In this way, the   Renaissance marks the beginning of the world in which all of us must now   find our way. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)  syllabus The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Baker (English)  syllabus Examines Western conceptions of the relation between humans and the natural world. Considers how 19th-century thinkers embraced, revised, and overturned ancient ideas about creation, natural order, the distinction between humans and animals, and the risks and rewards of probing nature's mysteries. Readings: Homer's Odyssey, Hebrew and Christian scripture, Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound, Shelley's Frankenstein, Darwin's Origin of Species, and works by Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Emerson, Goethe, and Nietzsche. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Corradi (Sociology)  syllabus A guide to the intellectual heritage distinctive to the West, with special attention to the nature of the person, freedom, rationality, democracy, and the social order. The works we study continue to shape the way people understand themselves and the world. They are 'classic' in the sense that they have not finished saying what they have to say. We situate them in historical context, looking for ways in which later authors responded to themes introduced by earlier ones. From the particularity of the West, these themes show a vocation for universality. Readings include: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Corinthians; Sophocles' Oedipus and Antigone; Plato's Apology and Republic; Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics; Pericles' Funeral Oration; Epictetus' Discourses; Augustine's Confessions; Tocqueville's Democracy in America; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origins of the Species; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism; Lincoln's Gettysburg Address; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (MAP)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ulfers (German)   syllabus  A conversation between two paradigms informing Western culture: the dominant, optimistic one, revolving around notions of historical progress toward absolute knowledge and utopian visions of the world and society; and the subterranean, pessimistic one, which looks on the former as a human construct or fiction that must come to naught. Readings: works from the Hebrew and Christian scriptures, Plato, and Sophocles; Augustine's Confessions; selections from Darwin; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Birth of Tragedy; Freud's Interpretation of Dreams; Kafka's Metamorphosis; Mann's Death in Venice.  FALL 2013 MAP-UA 410, Texts and Ideas: Topics\u2014Exile and Belonging\u2014Writing Intensive Prof. Waters (Irish Studies)  syllabus A writing-intensive version of Texts and Ideas offered in conjunction with selected sections of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay. Recommended for students regardless of intended major who seek a deeper engagement with the texts and more attention to writing about them than the regular versions of these courses can provide. While readings and assignments are shared between the lecture and the writing workshops, there are no recitations for this lecture; students must therefore be prepared to do substantial independent work without the support of a recitation section. Open to new CAS first-year students only.   The very possibility of our identity rests on the possibility of our estrangement. This theme haunts Western literature, philosophy, and politics from antiquity to the present. We examine the dynamic of exile and belonging, of place and displacement, by reading closely a series of classical texts that established a framework for thinking about culture, the state, and the individual. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Sophocles' Oedipus, Antigone, Oedipus at Colonus; Defoe's Robinson Crusoe; Shelley's Frankenstein; Douglass' Narrative of the Life of an American Slave; Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto; Nietzsche's Gay Science; Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents, and Disturbance of Memory at the Acropolis; selection from Ovid, Byron, Keats. NOTE: Students must also register for one of the linked section of EXPOS-UA 1, Writing the Essay: 016, 017, 018, 020, 021, 023, 025. Spring 2014 SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Political Economy Prof. Gross (History)   syllabus  What is the \u201cmarket\u201d, the \u201ceconomy\u201d, or \u201ccapitalism\u201d? How do individuals interact with each other in the marketplace? What is the morality of commerce? And how does, or should, the state govern the economy? These are all questions that have no simple answers and as a consequence they stimulate controversy today, in America and throughout the world. Yet these questions have a long pedigree. Since antiquity intellectuals have grappled with the fundamental issues of what in the past they called moral philosophy, what today we call political economy: how the individual, the market, and the state should interact with each other. Readings: Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Smith, Ricardo, Rousseau, Zola, Marx, Mill, Bagehot, Weber, Orwell, Keynes, Polanyi, Friedman, Hayek, Galbraith, Kindleberger, Harvey, Sachs. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Paranoid Narratives Prof. Sanders (Comparative Literature)   syllabus  It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began life in the nineteenth century as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and technology. We explore the evolution of ideas about paranoia through a careful reading of key texts, with special focus on narrative: Could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works from Europe and Africa, such as Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Head\u2019s A Question of Power, Marks\u2019 Not Either an Experimental Doll, Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014Guilt and Sin, Law and Justice Prof. Maudlin (Philosophy)  syllabus The   nature of justice, the legitimacy of law, and the justification for   punishment. We begin with Biblical accounts of sin and retribution,   Greek myths on the origin of the legal system, and the trial and   execution of Socrates. Turning to more modern works, we consider   theories of natural rights and the origin of legitimate states through   social contract, ending with three novels that present challenging views   of crime, the legal system, and the human soul. Readings: Genesis,   Exodus; Euripides\u2019 Oresteia; Plato\u2019s Apology, Crito, Phaedo, Republic;   Paine\u2019s Rights of Man; Melville\u2019s Billy Budd; Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and   Punishment; Kafka\u2019s Trial. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 400 Texts &amp; Ideas: Topics\u2014On Liberation Prof. Watson (English)   syllabus  What is liberation? What is the political form that allows for maximum freedom, and how is it to be achieved? How have the concepts of freedom, slavery and oppression been articulated by thinkers from Plato to Gandhi? We examine these enduring questions through a wide historical and cultural lens, aiming to understand and map out competing ideas around the conditions for freedom (and unfreedom). To this end, we read seminal works theorizing the relationship between the individual and the collective, ideas of sovereignty, the ideal state and the revolutionary nation, and arguments for violence and non-violence. While grounded in Western thought on the topic, we also pay attention to how the struggles and theorizations of the non-West (the Haitian Revolution, the Algerian and Indian independence struggles, postcolonialism and the Tricontinental) have shaped our inquiry into the nature and promise of liberation. Reading: Epictetus\u2019 Handbook, Plato\u2019s Republic, Equiano\u2019s Life, Shakespeare\u2019s Tempest, Rousseau\u2019s Discourse on Inequality, Mill\u2019s On Liberty, selections from Marx, James\u2019 Black Jacobins, Cesaire\u2019s Discourse on Colonialism, Gandhi\u2019s Hind Swaraj, Freire\u2019s Pedagogy of the Oppressed. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 402 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Renaissance Prof. Gilman (English)   syllabus  The \"Renaissance\" understands itself as an age bearing witness to the \"rebirth\" of classical antiquity. In art, philosophy, and literature it also assumes the task of reconciling the cultural inheritance of Greece and Rome with the Christian tradition (itself entering into a moment of crisis as allegiances split between the Catholic church and the \"reformed\" church of Luther and Calvin). Our first task is to look at antiquity; our second, to explore the ways in which European culture between 1400 and 1700 invents the modern by making itself conversant with the past. Readings: Homer's Odyssey; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Phaedo and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid; Genesis, Exodus, Job, Luke, Acts, John; Augustine's Confessions; Castiglione's Book of the Courtier; Machiavelli's Prince; Erasmus's Praise of Folly; Montaigne's Essays; More's Utopia; Shakespeare's Tempest. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Deneys-Tunney (French)   syllabus  The Enlightenment was a Europe-wide movement, which concerned all aspects of culture of the time: philosophy and literature, the arts (painting, music, architecture), as well as politics and society as a whole. The Enlightenment defined itself as a new birth, a subversive movement that would free mankind of all its prejudices--philosophical, religious, political, sexual, racial. In doing so, the Enlightenment appears today to be indeed the beginning of our modernity, as it invented key concepts that define or frame our contemporary representations of ourselves and the world around us: the concept of the subject or subjectivity, of nature, of origins, of equality, of critical philosophy and democracy, of pleasure, of sexuality, of happiness. It is a unique moment in history, where philosophy aims not only at interpreting the world but also at changing it to make it a better place for mankind. It culminates at the end of the 18th century in France with the French Revolution, which declared for the first time in human history that all men are born free and equal. Readings: Genesis, Plato's Symposium and Phedrus, Epicurus' Maxims and letters, Descartes' Discourse on Method, Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and R\u00eaveries, Diderot's Indiscreet Jewels and Jacques the Fatalist, Voltaire's Candide and Zadig, Marivaux's Dispute and Double Unfaithfulness, Kant's \"What is Enlightenment?\" SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 403 Texts and Ideas: Antiquity and the Enlightenment Prof. Chazan (Hebrew &amp; Judaic Studies)  syllabus Focuses on the understanding of knowledge and truth in antiquity and the Enlightenment. Divergent perspectives on knowledge and truth have important implications for society and the individual. They lead to alternative notions of how society should be ordered, who should exercise power in society, the goals of individual endeavor, and the nature of individual fulfillment. Key texts from antiquity and the Enlightenment will be read and analyzed with these issues uppermost in mind. Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Luke, Acts, Galatians; Sophocles' Antigone; Euripides' Bacchae; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Augustine's Confessions; Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus; Locke's Letter Concerning Toleration; Lessing's Nathan the Wise; Montesquieu's Persian Letters; Voltaire's Letters Concerning the English Nation; Paine's Age of Reason.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Ertman (Sociology)  syllabus Explores   the ancient foundations of traditional Western culture by examining the   political and social institutions, religious beliefs, and value systems   of the Israelites, Greeks, Romans, and early Christians; then turns to   the radical challenges to this traditional culture, in the areas of the   economy, politics, religion, and morality, that arose over the course of   the 19th century, challenges that continue to reverberate to this day.   Readings: Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Luke, Acts, Romans; Thucydides'   Peloponnesian War; Plato's Apology and Symposium; Vergil's Aeneid;   Augustine's Confessions; Smith's Wealth of Nations; Marx and Engels'   Communist Manifesto; Mill's On Liberty; Darwin's Origin of Species;   Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's Civilization and Its   Discontents.  SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Levene (Classics)   syllabus  Every society places demands on individuals: it could not do otherwise and still remain a society. But what happens when those demands are inconsistent? Can--or should--an individual determine the right course of action by reason alone? Or should one simply obey--but then, whom should one obey? What happens when people's moral judgments differ from the expectations of those around them? How can one maintain a society in the face of such conflicts? From the first moments of Western literature those questions are explored; they became all the more insistent in the unprecedented political, social, intellectual, and economic upheavals of the 19th century. One effect was the increasingly central role given to art itself, seen as the dynamic force able to create a cohesive society. Our study will include Richard Wagner's remarkable music-drama The Ring of the Nibelung, perhaps the most significant and influential art-work of the era (studied primarily as a text, though there will be opportunities to hear the music as well). Other readings will include selections from the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures; Homer's Iliad; Sophocles' Antigone; Plato's Gorgias; Vergil's Aeneid; poetry by (among others) Shelley, Tennyson, and Matthew Arnold; Arnold's Culture and Anarchy; Wagner's Art and Revolution; and Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality. SPRING 2014 CORE -UA 404 Texts &amp; Ideas: Antiquity and the 19th Century Prof. Renzi (College Core Curriculum)   syllabus  Contemporary moral psychology: where it came from, where it\u2019s brought us, how we might move beyond it. Readings: Book of J; Genesis, Exodus, Isaiah; Matthew, Galatians; Gospel of Mary; Euripides' Medea; Aristophanes' Clouds; Plato's Apology and Republic; Xenophon's Apology; Augustine's Confessions; Marx and Engels\u2019 Communist Manifesto; Kierkegaard's Fear and Trembling; Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morality; Freud's \"Case of Miss Lucy R.\" and Civilization and Its Discontents.
