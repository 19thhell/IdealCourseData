Our mission is to develop graduates capable of contributing to and advancing the practice of civil engineering and construction management and their sub-disciplines.   Our faculty actively participates in scholarly research activities, allowing us to be up-to-date in our areas of expertise and to incorporate research into our teaching. Through research, we contribute to finding better ways of developing and managing our vital civil infrastructure systems, including transportation, water supply/distribution, and waste disposal.   Students also join in research teams, which give them invaluable, hands-on experience that will prepare them for professional or research careers.   Faculty members teach undergraduate as well as graduate students. Thus, students are exposed to instructors who are in the forefront of their fields and who are frequently working on projects and topics of current interest, often within the region. Full-time faculty members are augmented by an excellent group of adjunct faculty who teach specialty courses in areas of their expertise, bringing a strong practical applications element to the classroom.

Our mission is to develop graduates capable of contributing to and advancing the practice of civil engineering and construction management and their sub-disciplines.   Our faculty actively participates in scholarly research activities, allowing us to be up-to-date in our areas of expertise and to incorporate research into our teaching. Through research, we contribute to finding better ways of developing and managing our vital civil infrastructure systems, including transportation, water supply/distribution, and waste disposal.   Students also join in research teams, which give them invaluable, hands-on experience that will prepare them for professional or research careers.   Faculty members teach undergraduate as well as graduate students. Thus, students are exposed to instructors who are in the forefront of their fields and who are frequently working on projects and topics of current interest, often within the region. Full-time faculty members are augmented by an excellent group of adjunct faculty who teach specialty courses in areas of their expertise, bringing a strong practical applications element to the classroom.

Here you will find an overview of the department\u2019s goals and programs.    One of the great benefits of majoring in Classics at NYU is the special attention students receive in a small department staffed by outstanding scholars. We cultivate a collegial atmosphere with monthly student/faculty teas, and we support the activities of a lively Classics Club. Undergraduates are encouraged to attend lectures by visiting scholars and in-house presentations of current research by faculty and graduate students. The Department's fifth floor space in Silver Center includes a library for students wishing to consult our specialized Classics holdings.    No special pre-college preparation is necessary to pursue a major in Classics.    The Director of Undergraduate Studies is Professor Michael Peachin . Please consult him for further information about programs of study in Classics.  Majors in Classics (five tracks)    1. Latin and Greek: This major requires two years of both Latin and Greek (i.e., four 4-point courses in each language) or the equivalent, plus either one advanced course in both, or two advanced courses in either.    2. Classical Civilization: This major requires ten 4-point courses. Either ancient Greek or Latin is required through the intermediate level (i.e., four 4-point courses or the equivalent). The remaining six courses may be selected from the various courses listed below. At least one history course and at least one literature course are required. Students are expected to discuss their program of study with a faculty adviser in the department, and all programs must be approved by the adviser.    3. Classics-Fine Arts (with emphasis on archaeology): This interdepartmental major requires two years of college-level ancient Greek or Latin or the equivalent, Introduction to Archaeology V27.0305, and four 4-point courses in fine arts (V43.0102, V43.0103, and two others selected from applicable courses, including those in Egyptian and Near Eastern art). This is a flexible major designed to accommodate special interests and requirements. Advanced-level courses in practical archaeology may be taken for credit.    4. Classical Civilization-Anthropology: This interdepartmental major may follow one of two tracks, each requiring 20 points from the Department of Anthropology and 20 points from the Department of Classics. The first track focuses on archaeology and requires A27.0303, V27.0305, and three other 4-point courses in classical civilization or languages. The second track emphasizes cultural anthropology and classical civilization, and requires A27.0303, V27.0143, and three other 4-point courses in classical civilization or languages. (Note: V27.0011 may not be used to fulfill these electives.) Additional requirements may be found under the Department of Anthropology (14).    5. Classical Civilization &amp; Hellenic Studies: This major offers the possibility of two different tracks. Both tracks require a total of ten 4-point courses.    Track A: Here, students concentrate in classical civilization. The major requires ancient Greek through the intermediate level (four 4-point courses), two 4-point courses from the offerings in classical civilization, and four 4-point courses offered through the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies.    Track B: This track requires modern Greek through the intermediate level (four 4-point courses), two 4-point courses from the offerings of the Onassis Center for Hellenic Studies, and four 4-point courses from the offerings in classical civilization. (Note: A student already proficient through the first- or second-year level of modern Greek will take two or four courses in place of the first and/or second year of modern Greek, with the consent of the appropriate faculty).        Minors in Classics (two tracks)    1. Latin and Greek: This minor requires five 4-point courses selected from the offerings of the department. As part of this minor, students must take either Latin or ancient Greek to the full intermediate level (A27.0006 or A27.0010, respectively). At least two of the required courses in ancient Greek or Latin must be taken in residence at NYU.    2. Classical Civilization: This minor requires five 4-point courses selected from the offerings in Latin, Greek, or classical civilization.
