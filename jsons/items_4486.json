The Building     The Sebasteion is located to the east of the city center,    opposite the North Agora, on the eastern side of a main north-south    street that ran past the Tetrapylon to the Theater. Its long and    narrow plan, set at an angle to the street and grid system, is to be    explained by the presence of large, pre-existing residential    establishments excavated to the northeast and to the southwest of the    complex. That is, the building had to be fitted into an awkward city    space.          The complex is composed of four distinct architectural elements:     a Propylon at the west, two long buildings to the north and south that    frame a paved sanctuary or processional space (14 m. wide and 90 m.    long),and a Temple at the east end, the focus of the whole layout.     Two (related) leading local families paid for the complex. One family    paid for the Propylon and the North Building, the other for the South    Building and the Temple. Construction of the complex, which was    interrupted by a major earthquake, took two generations: work was    begun in the reign of Tiberius, c. A.D. 20, and brought to completion    early in the reign of Nero, c. A.D. 60.          The Propylon was a two-storeyed columnar screen with projecting    aediculae that connected the North and South Buildings to give the    complex a continuous monumental facade facing onto the street. The    gate carried a series of Julio-Claudian portrait statues, as well as    statues of Aeneas and Aphrodite Prometor--in her role as    &quot;Foremother&quot;of the Roman emperors.          Inside, in the street-like sanctuary space, the North and South    Buildings rose with three-storeyed engaged marble facades to a height    of twelve meters. These facades consisted of superimposed Doric,    Ionic, and Corinthian orders, with relief decoration in the upper two    storeys, and each thus presented a closed marble &quot;picture wall&quot;     to the    sanctuary street. The purpose of the buildings behind was simply to    support the thin marble facades. The buildings are divided behind    into chambers (ca. 5 x 5 meters) that are constructed of rough masonry    and have earth floors whose remains do not indicate any real use or    function until the Late Roman period (when there is evidence of    commercial and manufacturing activity). While close in overall    dimensions and effect, the North and South Buildings have marked    differences, both in architectural design and in their relief program,    that no doubt reflect the split sponsorship of the project.          Little remains of the Temple which was probably dismantled    sometime in the Late Roman period. It was set up high on a platform,    on the axis of the complex, and set back from the east ends of the&#145;    North and South Buildings. The layout of the temple and sanctuary    thus closely resembles that of the Forum of Caesar in Rome in which    the temple was also dedicated to Aphrodite/Venus in her role as    Prometor/Genetrix of the Julian dynasty. Enough remains of the    architecture to be sure that it was a Roman-inspired podium prostyle    temple of the Corinthian order, with six columns across the front and    a wide cella behind. Its inscribed architrave included a dedication    to Tiberius and Livia.          While the axial-symmetrical plan of the complex resembles that    of the imperial fora, and in particular that of Caesar, which may have    been its direct inspiration, it probably functioned rather    differently. Rather than a closed sanctuary space, the plan was open    at both ends (the Propylon had no actual gates and the Temple is not    connected in any way with the North and South Buildings) and allowed    free access through the complex in both directions. In other words,    instead of being solely a sanctuary entered and exited through the    Propylon, the complex also functioned, outside cult occasions, as a    highly-decorated, monumental city avenue which carried people both    east into the city center and west into the surrounding residential    districts around and behind the Temple. This wider civic as well as     religious function helps to explain the lavish relief program with    which the North and South Buildings were decorated.          The Sebasteion, excavated in 1979-81, was a grandiose      temple complex dedicated to Aphrodite and the Julio-Claudian emperors.      Its construction stretched over two generations, from ca. A.D. 20 to      60, from the reign of Tiberius to that of Nero. The complex was paid      for by two of the leading Aphrodisian families. Leading to a Corinthian      temple, a narrow processional way (90 X 14 m) was flanked by two portico-like      buildings, each three-storied (12 m high), with superimposed Doric,      Ionic, and Corinthian orders, and decorated with a long series of figured      marble reliefs. More than seventy of the 190 reliefs that the project      required were recovered in the excavation. They featured Roman emperors,      Greek myths, and a series of personified ethne or 'nations' of Augustus'      world empire, from the Ethiopians of Africa to the Callaeci of western      Spain.

The distinctive history of Panama contributes to the division of these categories and this division best facilitates the analysis of architectural designs in Panama.   Indigenous Vernacular \u2013 Architecture that is considered vernacular is concerned with the domestic and functional rather than the monumental. 1 Panama has no pre-colonial, monumental architecture and one can assume that the native structures that were lived in pre-colonial are quite similar to the native structures lived in today. 2 \u00a0 The indigenous vernacular architecture of Panama is unlike most vernacular architecture studied and the extreme poverty of Panama is a significant contributor to this dynamic.   Generally speaking Panama has a relatively high-income per capita, US $3,080 in 1997.\u00a0 But roughly 37 percent of the population are considered impoverished and half of this percentage are living in extreme poverty. 3\u00a0 \u00a0Because of this high poverty the indigenous vernacular architecture is unadorned and utilitarian.\u00a0 The three indigenous groups of Panama have distinct dwellings unique to one another with exception to similar palm thatched roofs.\u00a0 The Guaymi (Ngobe-Bugle) live in a circular shaped dwelling with wooden framed walls covered in mud and livestock manure.\u00a0 The Kuna live in a rectangular shaped structure with cana blanca walls, a kind of sugar cane. The Choco (Embere-Wounaan) live in square dwellings with no walls, built on stilts along river banks, lakes and the ocean. 2    Guaymi Dwelling, Kuna Dwelling, Choco Dwelling   The traditional indigenous vernacular architecture utilizes locally found materials but more often now the dwellings will incorporate non-traditional building materials.\u00a0In recent past, there have been governmental funded efforts to apply the traditional vernacular architecture to address housing needs of the impoverished.\u00a0 This movement does not suggest complete authenticity of material and construction, rather incorporating modern facilities and materials in the traditionally practiced construction and design. 4   European Influence \u2013 The influence of European architecture contributes greatly to the historic building stock of Panama.\u00a0 With the arrival of the Spanish in the 1500s, so to came the arrival of Spanish influenced architecture.\u00a0 The early settlements mimicked city-planning styles of Europe with grid plans and center squares focused on churches or governmental buildings.\u00a0 The architectural styles are a mixture of Spanish colonial, baroque, and neoclassical design. 5    Panama Viejo Ruins   Important Spanish settlements include Panama Viejo and what is now called Casco Antiguo or the Historic District of Panama, which replaced Panama Viejo after it was abandoned in the 17 th century.\u00a0 Both sites are excellent evidence of colonial town planning and offer proof of unique technological and stylistic characteristics.\u00a0 The most noteworthy and lasting buildings of the historic district are the cathedrals and churches.\u00a0 Five aisles and colonial timber roofs characterize the cathedrals.\u00a0 The more well known are San Felipe Neri, San Jos\u00e9, San Francisco and La Merced. 5    San Felipe Neri, San Jose, San Francisco, La Merced   After Panama\u2019s independence from Spain, other European countries, including France and England, began to influence the architecture of Panama.\u00a0 The Presidential Palace (of Spanish-Moorish style) exemplifies the evolution of European influence in the Historic District as it was transformed in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries from its original design in the late 17th century. 5 The Gran Hotel (of French colonial style), now the Canal Museum building and the Municipal Palace (of neoclassical style) are significant buildings of a European influence. 2    The Presidential Palace, Canal Museum   Modern Development \u2013 The completion of the canal has brought great wealth to the country, which has in turn led to architectural advancement in design and construction. Modern architectural styles have entered the urban fabric in Panama, specifically in Panama City. \u00a0\u201cIn 2011, 10 buildings over 200 meters were built, more than any other city in the world and double the number of tall buildings completed in the rest of the Americas.\u201d 6 Also, many developers are looking for efficient building designs that maximizes their profits making sustainable design efforts a requirement for many projects. 6   One of the most recent notable modern installations in Panama is the Biomuseo by Gehry Partners.\u00a0 It is Frank Gehry\u2019s first building in Latin America (an international renowned, Pritzker Prize\u2013winning architect).\u00a0 This fact alone demonstrates the significance of Panama\u2019s recent real estate development and cultural progress. The founders wanted the museum to be an architectural icon for Panama. 7 These efforts proved successful with the most recent addition to the Copa Airlines fleet, painted with a graphic design in reference to the museum. 8    Biomuseo, Copa Airlines   A design of colorful, metal-plated canopies layered over concrete columns, it will hold eight galleries and educate visitors on Panama\u2019s biological unique qualities and global impact. This project will play a major role in Panamanian society, culture and education. 7   Other noteworthy architectural designs emerging in Panama include the Trump Ocean Club (Hirsch Bedner Associates), Casa del Horno (F\u00e9mur Arquitectura), and the new proposed Panama City Hospital (Taller de Arquitectura S\u00e1nchez-Horneros). 9 \u00a0 Trump Ocean Club is the tallest tower in Panama City and is the first international Trump hotel which makes it another important first for Panama real estate development. 10 Casa del Horno takes on the continual evolution of the Historic District by marrying an 1850 house with a modern boutique hotel. 11 \u00a0 The Panama City Hospital is designed as a \u201c hospital city \u201d , improving upon the campus notion, with ecological protections and passive bioclimatic strategies as fundamental goals. 12    Trump Ocean Club &#8211; Hirsch Bedner Associates, Casa del Horno &#8211; F\u00e9mur Arquitectura, Panama City Hospital &#8211; TASH   The complex balance of the distinct architectural designs in Panama is unlike most countries.\u00a0 Architecture in any location plays a large role in telling a history of place and Panama is not excluded from this truth.\u00a0 The juxtaposition of architectural design in Panama contributes to the richness of culture and locale that will add value and accelerate growth in Panama.     Questions for our Biomuseo Presenters   1. The museum is set to be an icon for the country of Panama.\u00a0 It has been compared to the Eiffel Tower of France and the Tower of Pisa of Italy.\u00a0 The somewhat oblivious difference between these two structures and the Biomuseo is that Stephen Sauvestre and Bonanno Pisano were French and Italian, respectively.\u00a0 During the planning phase of the museum, was there any disapproval of the selection of the American architect chosen, despite his marriage to a Panamanian woman, when there are notable Panamanian architects worthy to the task?\u00a0 (Such as Bettis Tarazi Arquitectos, or Patrick Dillon,)   It is a shame that a Panamanian could not have designed the proposed iconic building of Panama.\u00a0 But Gehry has been invested in this project for 15 years and has devoted much of his talent to the project.   2. The design of the museum is very unique.\u00a0 Even for Frank Gehry.\u00a0 How have Panamanians received the project?\u00a0 Are the people excited for the iconic building?\u00a0 Or do you feel the museum is designed for the global tourist?   The Panamanians must be excited to have an iconic building near their most famous body of water.\u00a0 The museum has struck many nerves, which have led to strong opinions both good and bad.\u00a0 It is very unique and even if there are negative opinions about the structure the shear grandeur and commanding presence of the design should improve approval and opinions in years to come.   3. The museum has taken almost a decade to complete (conception in 1999, ground breaking in 2004, and proposed completion 2011) and is finished significantly over budget (proposed $60 M, completed $95 M with needs for an additional $15 M expected).\u00a0 To the best of your knowledge, what (if anything) could have changed this outcome?   The design is very complex, the materials used are very advanced, and the details designed are very unique.\u00a0 The local Panamanian construction crew might have been in over their heads and a consideration for this ahead of time was necessary.\u00a0 Also, just as in the case of the French attempt at the canal, consideration for the brutal climate was overlooked &#8211; ironically repeating history.
