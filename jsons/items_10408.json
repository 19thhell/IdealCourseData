Through a broad range of courses in Russian language, history, literature, and culture, the department aims to give students a thorough understanding of one of the most interesting and significant cultures in the world today. Whether in popular lecture courses treating the Russian classics in translation, surveys of modern Russian history and politics, or in small seminars devoted to the close study of texts and primary sources in the original, faculty members are committed to conveying to students the vibrancy of a culture that is at once central to the development of modern European culture and strikingly exotic to western readers.
