When speaking of great contemporary patrons of the arts, we often hear someone called \u201ca modern Medici.\u201d What exactly does this phrase mean and how did the family name of the principal banking house of Renaissance Florence become synonymous with the sponsorship of cultural endeavors? This course attempts to answer these questions and others by examining the development of Medici patronage from the emergence of the family as a political force at the dawn of the Renaissance to the establishment of the grand ducal dynasty that reigned for almost two centuries in Florence. The commissions of Cosimo the Elder, Piero the Gouty, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the two Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and the first three Medic Grand Dukes (Cosimo I, Francesco I and Ferdinando I) are given particular emphasis. Issues such as familial pietas, the power and influence of Medici women and the varying political climate in Florence and Rome are also considered as fundamental to the development of characteristically Medicean patterns of patronage.    The role of the patron in determining the ultimate appearance of works of art and architecture is given primary consideration here. The Medici are therefore considered as a test case for understanding the importance of patronage for the history of Renaissance art. This may be best examined through the Medici\u2019s continued patronage of certain artists over extended periods of time. The works of artists such as Brunelleschi, Michelozzo, Donatello, Fra Angelico, Michelangelo, Bandinelli, Vasari and Buontalenti, all of whom produced significant numbers of works under the aegis of the Medici, are therefore the main focus of the lectures, class discussions and site visits. Comparison of Medici modes of patronage with local would-be rivals or imitators and with great foreign patrons will help to provide a measure of what is both characteristic of all Renaissance patrons and what is unique to the Medici themselves.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

It is organizationally and academically linked to the European University Institute (EUI), also located in Florence, a top-level interdisciplinary graduate institute and think tank.   An archive on the EU represents a welcome challenge for history students, since it is not completely clear &quot;what the EU is&quot;. It is neither a state in the traditional sense, nor is it limited to being an international organization. Whereas most forms of stateness in Europe and in the rest of the democratic world can be considered more or less stable, the EU is still a political actor in the making - and there is evidence that it will remain a moving target for historians, political scientists, law experts and economists for still many years to come. Thus, different from other archives, the archive on the EU does not contain documents and information on a historical process which is already completed, but which is and will still be ongoing.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Student should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   Florence can be considered the historic capital of optics: as the leading center for the production of lenses and spectacles in the Renaissance, it was also a center for extraordinary experimentation regarding the science of vision. The experiments and writings of such masters as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Giovan Battista della Porta and Galileo, among others, are testimony to the extraordinary contributions made here to the understanding of sight and to the development of devices that aided, altered or controlled vision for artistic purpose.   This course proposes to contextualize historic photographic techniques within this rich context of the history of optics. An invaluable resource for this exploration will be the Acton Photograph Archive at Villa La Pietra with its rich collection of stereographs, daguerrotypes, ambrotypes, silver prints and albumen prints. Students will thus be able to learn about these historic techniques by examining firsthand surviving, in some cases extremely rare, examples of them.   Following the inspiration of these historic techniques, from the experiments of the Florentine Renaissance artists to those of the Alinari Brothers, a firm founded in Florence in the nineteenth century and renowned throughout the world as an early innovator in the uses and techniques of photography, students will have the opportunity to explore these techniques themselves hands on. They will be encouraged to develop their individual expression through their own projects employing one or more of these historic photographic techniques. This inspiring course on experimental photography explores new possibilities of imagemaking by combining pinhole and toy cameras and other alternative techniques with a theoretical approach to representation.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society - IPHTI-UT 1200 - 4 points                                A digital SLR camera is required.     NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                 Physics                                                  Readings in Particle Physics - PHYS-UA 9136- 3 points                               Prerequisite: Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105)   Course Description:   Particle physics is the study of the very fundamental constituents of matter and of the forces between them. By its nature it is microscopic, but it also connects with astrophysics and cosmology on the largest scales. This course introduces the most important advances in elementary particle physics. It centers on journal articles in which these advances were first published, with overview lectures, original reading, discussion, and student presentations. Topics include the discovery of elementary particles in cosmic rays, antimatter, symmetries found in nature, and the invention of the Quark model of elementary particles and its experimental verification. A field trip with a visit to CERN is planned for the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Physics and Astronomy in the Renaissance - PHYS-UA 9800- 4 points                               Course Description:   In addition to the magnifi cent flowering of the arts in the Renaissance, the Renaissance period was also one of extraordinary advance in science, in particular in astronomy and physics. The course  will examine this advance, emanating from the scientific developments in the European and Italian centers of learning during the Renaissance and at the start of the Age of Enlightenment, in the light of prior wisdom. The topics will center on the 'Copernican Revolution' of Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei that was the beginning of observational science and astronomy.   The course is a combined science and science-history course, open to all students, including non-science majors, with no prerequisites. Physics majors will attend an extra recitation to receive elective credit toward the major.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.     Sample Syllabus                                                                         Acton Seminar: Policies and Politics of the European Union - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               The European Union is a unique and strange entity. It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    United States &amp; European Union Relations since WWII - POL-UA 9721 - 4 points                               This course explores the role of the US in Europe from the end of World War II to the present with a particular emphasis on understanding the sources of cooperation and conflict. The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

The first opens with an analysis of the intellectual foundations of the witch-hunt from late Antiquity to the early Renaissance. The second section concentrates on the most infamous handbook for witch-hunters, Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of the Witches\u201d) and on the roots of medieval misogyny. The third section looks at the mass witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the backdrop of the break between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and examines the connections linking witch-hunting to the momentous social, political and religious changes of the times. In the fourth part, the course will shift focus to the grassroots level, shedding light on the economic and social mechanisms which lead a community to \u201cmake a witch\u201d.   Sample Syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Sociology of Consumerism - SOC-UA 9160 - 4 points                               Consumption practices in advanced, market societies seem to have replaced the importance of productive activities in the reproduction of the social order. Consumption has tended to cover a dual role: both economic (of course) and cultural (and this is a rather new role). The importance of consumer goods and the meaning attached to consumption processes are by now fully recognized by the social sciences as important parts in the construction of group-identity and self-image. Consumerism pervades people's everyday lives and generates relative deprivation phenomena throughout. However the relationship between consumption and consumerism is not self-evident. The Course intends to discuss the relationship between 'consumption' and 'consumerism' broadly following the assumption that \u201cwhile consumption is an act, consumerism may be perceived as a way of life\u201d.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making. Works will be examined on their native terms: both as physical objects, with sensitivity to their particular function and intended reception, and as visual images active within larger contexts.

When speaking of great contemporary patrons of the arts, we often hear someone called \u201ca modern Medici.\u201d What exactly does this phrase mean and how did the family name of the principal banking house of Renaissance Florence become synonymous with the sponsorship of cultural endeavors? This course attempts to answer these questions and others by examining the development of Medici patronage from the emergence of the family as a political force at the dawn of the Renaissance to the establishment of the grand ducal dynasty that reigned for almost two centuries in Florence. The commissions of Cosimo the Elder, Piero the Gouty, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the two Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and the first three Medic Grand Dukes (Cosimo I, Francesco I and Ferdinando I) are given particular emphasis. Issues such as familial pietas, the power and influence of Medici women and the varying political climate in Florence and Rome are also considered as fundamental to the development of characteristically Medicean patterns of patronage.    The role of the patron in determining the ultimate appearance of works of art and architecture is given primary consideration here. The Medici are therefore considered as a test case for understanding the importance of patronage for the history of Renaissance art. This may be best examined through the Medici\u2019s continued patronage of certain artists over extended periods of time. The works of artists such as Brunelleschi, Michelozzo, Donatello, Fra Angelico, Michelangelo, Bandinelli, Vasari and Buontalenti, all of whom produced significant numbers of works under the aegis of the Medici, are therefore the main focus of the lectures, class discussions and site visits. Comparison of Medici modes of patronage with local would-be rivals or imitators and with great foreign patrons will help to provide a measure of what is both characteristic of all Renaissance patrons and what is unique to the Medici themselves.

In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

This course explores the development of fashion as an integral part of Italian identity. It looks at four historical moments or movements that played a significant role in developing that identity: Renaissance Florence under the de Medici, Mussolini\u2019s mandate for Italian-based fashion, the post-war Italian film industry in the 1950s and 60s, and, today\u2019s global fashion industry where the image of Italian style is one of quality, luxury and sexy elegance.

The &quot;Italy and Italians&quot; of the title refers not only to images and characters in the works of the British and American authors we will be reading but also to their affinities with Italian literature. Recurring themes in the course will be history and its uses in literature, gender and sexuality, democracy and aristocracy, language and power, and religion as an instrument of sexual repression.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

It is organizationally and academically linked to the European University Institute (EUI), also located in Florence, a top-level interdisciplinary graduate institute and think tank.   An archive on the EU represents a welcome challenge for history students, since it is not completely clear &quot;what the EU is&quot;. It is neither a state in the traditional sense, nor is it limited to being an international organization. Whereas most forms of stateness in Europe and in the rest of the democratic world can be considered more or less stable, the EU is still a political actor in the making - and there is evidence that it will remain a moving target for historians, political scientists, law experts and economists for still many years to come. Thus, different from other archives, the archive on the EU does not contain documents and information on a historical process which is already completed, but which is and will still be ongoing.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Student should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   Florence can be considered the historic capital of optics: as the leading center for the production of lenses and spectacles in the Renaissance, it was also a center for extraordinary experimentation regarding the science of vision. The experiments and writings of such masters as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Giovan Battista della Porta and Galileo, among others, are testimony to the extraordinary contributions made here to the understanding of sight and to the development of devices that aided, altered or controlled vision for artistic purpose.   This course proposes to contextualize historic photographic techniques within this rich context of the history of optics. An invaluable resource for this exploration will be the Acton Photograph Archive at Villa La Pietra with its rich collection of stereographs, daguerrotypes, ambrotypes, silver prints and albumen prints. Students will thus be able to learn about these historic techniques by examining firsthand surviving, in some cases extremely rare, examples of them.   Following the inspiration of these historic techniques, from the experiments of the Florentine Renaissance artists to those of the Alinari Brothers, a firm founded in Florence in the nineteenth century and renowned throughout the world as an early innovator in the uses and techniques of photography, students will have the opportunity to explore these techniques themselves hands on. They will be encouraged to develop their individual expression through their own projects employing one or more of these historic photographic techniques. This inspiring course on experimental photography explores new possibilities of imagemaking by combining pinhole and toy cameras and other alternative techniques with a theoretical approach to representation.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

By its nature it is microscopic, but it also connects with astrophysics and cosmology on the largest scales. This course introduces the most important advances in elementary particle physics. It centers on journal articles in which these advances were first published, with overview lectures, original reading, discussion, and student presentations. Topics include the discovery of elementary particles in cosmic rays, antimatter, symmetries found in nature, and the invention of the Quark model of elementary particles and its experimental verification. A field trip with a visit to CERN is planned for the course.

The course  will examine this advance, emanating from the scientific developments in the European and Italian centers of learning during the Renaissance and at the start of the Age of Enlightenment, in the light of prior wisdom. The topics will center on the 'Copernican Revolution' of Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei that was the beginning of observational science and astronomy.   The course is a combined science and science-history course, open to all students, including non-science majors, with no prerequisites. Physics majors will attend an extra recitation to receive elective credit toward the major.

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.     Sample Syllabus                                                                         Acton Seminar: Policies and Politics of the European Union - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               The European Union is a unique and strange entity. It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

The first opens with an analysis of the intellectual foundations of the witch-hunt from late Antiquity to the early Renaissance. The second section concentrates on the most infamous handbook for witch-hunters, Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of the Witches\u201d) and on the roots of medieval misogyny. The third section looks at the mass witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the backdrop of the break between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and examines the connections linking witch-hunting to the momentous social, political and religious changes of the times. In the fourth part, the course will shift focus to the grassroots level, shedding light on the economic and social mechanisms which lead a community to \u201cmake a witch\u201d.   Sample Syllabus                              Sociology                                                  Sociology of Consumerism - SOC-UA 9160 - 4 points                               Consumption practices in advanced, market societies seem to have replaced the importance of productive activities in the reproduction of the social order. Consumption has tended to cover a dual role: both economic (of course) and cultural (and this is a rather new role). The importance of consumer goods and the meaning attached to consumption processes are by now fully recognized by the social sciences as important parts in the construction of group-identity and self-image. Consumerism pervades people's everyday lives and generates relative deprivation phenomena throughout. However the relationship between consumption and consumerism is not self-evident. The Course intends to discuss the relationship between 'consumption' and 'consumerism' broadly following the assumption that \u201cwhile consumption is an act, consumerism may be perceived as a way of life\u201d.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

Innovative, site-specific offerings in art history, history, literature and cinema are featured alongside a vibrant curriculum in sociology, politics and economics. These courses not only take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources provided by the city of Florence, and its strategic position within Italy and Europe, but also of a unique array of co-curricular lectures and activities that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly exchange and global policy discussions.   What can study abroad in Florence mean to students? An encounter with the city of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio; direct examination of world-famous masterpieces of art in the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Renaissance; to consider contemporary social issues at a campus where encounters for students with major European and American protagonists of world social and economic policy are a regular occurrence.   Throughout the year, students at NYU Florence benefit from the opportunity to participate directly in the high-level political, social and cultural policy dialogues organized on our campus. In previous years, we have hosted both Republican and Democrat presidential campaign managers, had a three-way dialogue with leading local Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders, and held a student-organized contemporary poetry slam. Through La Pietra Dialogues, interested students also have the opportunity to participate directly in the organization of the events that bring these outstanding figures to NYU Florence.   NYU Florence provides the atmosphere of a small college campus while studying abroad. An extremely low student to faculty ratio ensures small class size; many courses are organized partly or entirely as seminars. Our 57-acre estate, with olive groves and gardens, has five villas that provide a home to NYU Florence. These include Villa La Pietra with its house museum, and formal gardens. Students enjoy the opportunity to &quot;live&quot; Villa La Pietra during: visits to the collection; poetry readings, concerts, performances and lectures that take place inside or in the gardens of the villa               Learn     Courses   Special Programs   Freshman Program   Facilities   Faculty   Community Service                 Live     Housing &amp; Meals   Getting Around   Cost &amp; Budgeting   Language   Culture &amp; Customs   Safety   Health &amp; Wellness     Staff                 Explore     Restaurants   Nightlife   Things to do   Local Travel   Regional Travel   Shopping                                                                       Info for Parents                                                                                                Info for External Advisers                                                                                                Visit Other NYU Global Centers                                                      La Pietra Dialogues LPD convenes some of the world\u2019s foremost scholars, policy makers, practitioners, business leaders, public intellectuals and artists whose ideas and work have made a significant cultural or intellectual contribution to global society and the revival of the spirit of humanism for which Florence is known. They gather at Villa la Pietra, New York University's exceptional site in Florence, to confront some of the most intractable issues of contemporary society through the creative interplay of ideas and perspectives.  LPD fosters the creation of partnerships across disciplines, cultures and institutions, as an established center in the heart of Europe attached to an American university with branches throughout the world, and contributes to the emerging global civic discourse that is at the heart of NYU\u2019s mission as a global network university.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Medici Patronage - ARTH-UA 9656 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: ARTH-UA 2 (History of Western Art II) or Art History AP score of 5.     When speaking of great contemporary patrons of the arts, we often hear someone called \u201ca modern Medici.\u201d What exactly does this phrase mean and how did the family name of the principal banking house of Renaissance Florence become synonymous with the sponsorship of cultural endeavors? This course attempts to answer these questions and others by examining the development of Medici patronage from the emergence of the family as a political force at the dawn of the Renaissance to the establishment of the grand ducal dynasty that reigned for almost two centuries in Florence. The commissions of Cosimo the Elder, Piero the Gouty, Lorenzo the Magnificent, the two Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII) and the first three Medic Grand Dukes (Cosimo I, Francesco I and Ferdinando I) are given particular emphasis. Issues such as familial pietas, the power and influence of Medici women and the varying political climate in Florence and Rome are also considered as fundamental to the development of characteristically Medicean patterns of patronage.    The role of the patron in determining the ultimate appearance of works of art and architecture is given primary consideration here. The Medici are therefore considered as a test case for understanding the importance of patronage for the history of Renaissance art. This may be best examined through the Medici\u2019s continued patronage of certain artists over extended periods of time. The works of artists such as Brunelleschi, Michelozzo, Donatello, Fra Angelico, Michelangelo, Bandinelli, Vasari and Buontalenti, all of whom produced significant numbers of works under the aegis of the Medici, are therefore the main focus of the lectures, class discussions and site visits. Comparison of Medici modes of patronage with local would-be rivals or imitators and with great foreign patrons will help to provide a measure of what is both characteristic of all Renaissance patrons and what is unique to the Medici themselves.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

It is organizationally and academically linked to the European University Institute (EUI), also located in Florence, a top-level interdisciplinary graduate institute and think tank.   An archive on the EU represents a welcome challenge for history students, since it is not completely clear &quot;what the EU is&quot;. It is neither a state in the traditional sense, nor is it limited to being an international organization. Whereas most forms of stateness in Europe and in the rest of the democratic world can be considered more or less stable, the EU is still a political actor in the making - and there is evidence that it will remain a moving target for historians, political scientists, law experts and economists for still many years to come. Thus, different from other archives, the archive on the EU does not contain documents and information on a historical process which is already completed, but which is and will still be ongoing.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Student should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   Florence can be considered the historic capital of optics: as the leading center for the production of lenses and spectacles in the Renaissance, it was also a center for extraordinary experimentation regarding the science of vision. The experiments and writings of such masters as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Giovan Battista della Porta and Galileo, among others, are testimony to the extraordinary contributions made here to the understanding of sight and to the development of devices that aided, altered or controlled vision for artistic purpose.   This course proposes to contextualize historic photographic techniques within this rich context of the history of optics. An invaluable resource for this exploration will be the Acton Photograph Archive at Villa La Pietra with its rich collection of stereographs, daguerrotypes, ambrotypes, silver prints and albumen prints. Students will thus be able to learn about these historic techniques by examining firsthand surviving, in some cases extremely rare, examples of them.   Following the inspiration of these historic techniques, from the experiments of the Florentine Renaissance artists to those of the Alinari Brothers, a firm founded in Florence in the nineteenth century and renowned throughout the world as an early innovator in the uses and techniques of photography, students will have the opportunity to explore these techniques themselves hands on. They will be encouraged to develop their individual expression through their own projects employing one or more of these historic photographic techniques. This inspiring course on experimental photography explores new possibilities of imagemaking by combining pinhole and toy cameras and other alternative techniques with a theoretical approach to representation.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society - IPHTI-UT 1200 - 4 points                                A digital SLR camera is required.     NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Photography of Architecture, City and Territory - IPHTI-UT 1210 - 4 points                               City, territory and architecture have been, from the beginning of photography, privileged objects for its practice. Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.     Sample Syllabus                                 Physics                                                  Readings in Particle Physics - PHYS-UA 9136- 3 points                               Prerequisite: Classical and Quantum Waves (PHYS-UA 105)   Course Description:   Particle physics is the study of the very fundamental constituents of matter and of the forces between them. By its nature it is microscopic, but it also connects with astrophysics and cosmology on the largest scales. This course introduces the most important advances in elementary particle physics. It centers on journal articles in which these advances were first published, with overview lectures, original reading, discussion, and student presentations. Topics include the discovery of elementary particles in cosmic rays, antimatter, symmetries found in nature, and the invention of the Quark model of elementary particles and its experimental verification. A field trip with a visit to CERN is planned for the course.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Physics and Astronomy in the Renaissance - PHYS-UA 9800- 4 points                               Course Description:   In addition to the magnifi cent flowering of the arts in the Renaissance, the Renaissance period was also one of extraordinary advance in science, in particular in astronomy and physics. The course  will examine this advance, emanating from the scientific developments in the European and Italian centers of learning during the Renaissance and at the start of the Age of Enlightenment, in the light of prior wisdom. The topics will center on the 'Copernican Revolution' of Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei that was the beginning of observational science and astronomy.   The course is a combined science and science-history course, open to all students, including non-science majors, with no prerequisites. Physics majors will attend an extra recitation to receive elective credit toward the major.     Sample Syllabus                                Politics                                                  Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.     Sample Syllabus                                                                         Acton Seminar: Policies and Politics of the European Union - POL-UA 9595 - 4 points                               The European Union is a unique and strange entity. It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

The first opens with an analysis of the intellectual foundations of the witch-hunt from late Antiquity to the early Renaissance. The second section concentrates on the most infamous handbook for witch-hunters, Malleus Maleficarum (\u201cThe Hammer of the Witches\u201d) and on the roots of medieval misogyny. The third section looks at the mass witch-hunts of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries on the backdrop of the break between Protestant and Catholic Europe, and examines the connections linking witch-hunting to the momentous social, political and religious changes of the times. In the fourth part, the course will shift focus to the grassroots level, shedding light on the economic and social mechanisms which lead a community to \u201cmake a witch\u201d.

Consumption has tended to cover a dual role: both economic (of course) and cultural (and this is a rather new role). The importance of consumer goods and the meaning attached to consumption processes are by now fully recognized by the social sciences as important parts in the construction of group-identity and self-image. Consumerism pervades people's everyday lives and generates relative deprivation phenomena throughout. However the relationship between consumption and consumerism is not self-evident. The Course intends to discuss the relationship between 'consumption' and 'consumerism' broadly following the assumption that \u201cwhile consumption is an act, consumerism may be perceived as a way of life\u201d.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

Innovative, site-specific offerings in art history, history, literature and cinema are featured alongside a vibrant curriculum in sociology, politics and economics. These courses not only take advantage of the extraordinary cultural resources provided by the city of Florence, and its strategic position within Italy and Europe, but also of a unique array of co-curricular lectures and activities that make the Florence campus a dynamic center for scholarly exchange and global policy discussions.   What can study abroad in Florence mean to students? An encounter with the city of Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio; direct examination of world-famous masterpieces of art in the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Renaissance; to consider contemporary social issues at a campus where encounters for students with major European and American protagonists of world social and economic policy are a regular occurrence.   Throughout the year, students at NYU Florence benefit from the opportunity to participate directly in the high-level political, social and cultural policy dialogues organized on our campus. In previous years, we have hosted both Republican and Democrat presidential campaign managers, had a three-way dialogue with leading local Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders, and held a student-organized contemporary poetry slam. Through La Pietra Dialogues, interested students also have the opportunity to participate directly in the organization of the events that bring these outstanding figures to NYU Florence.   NYU Florence provides the atmosphere of a small college campus while studying abroad. An extremely low student to faculty ratio ensures small class size; many courses are organized partly or entirely as seminars. Our 57-acre estate, with olive groves and gardens, has five villas that provide a home to NYU Florence. These include Villa La Pietra with its house museum, and formal gardens. Students enjoy the opportunity to &quot;live&quot; Villa La Pietra during: visits to the collection; poetry readings, concerts, performances and lectures that take place inside or in the gardens of the villa               Learn     Courses   Special Programs   Freshman Program   Facilities   Faculty   Community Service                 Live     Housing &amp; Meals   Getting Around   Cost &amp; Budgeting   Language   Culture &amp; Customs   Safety   Health &amp; Wellness     Staff                 Explore     Restaurants   Nightlife   Things to do   Local Travel   Regional Travel   Shopping                                                                       Info for Parents                                                                                                Info for External Advisers                                                                                                Visit Other NYU Global Centers                                                      La Pietra Dialogues LPD convenes some of the world\u2019s foremost scholars, policy makers, practitioners, business leaders, public intellectuals and artists whose ideas and work have made a significant cultural or intellectual contribution to global society and the revival of the spirit of humanism for which Florence is known.

This international law school boasts a long tradition of European legal studies and continues to be a strong leader in the field, attracting students and scholars from around the globe.   Up to two NYU Law students may participate per year. Students must be second or third year and have spent at least one full year at the NYU School of Law. The majority of courses are conducted in English.   The European University Institute Law program is international in nature, specifically focusing on the interaction among European national and cross-national legal systems. The areas of human rights, economic, environmental, and governmental law have a strong history at EUI. Additional information about the EUI Department of Law can be found here .   Over fourteen renovated historic buildings scattered about the Tuscan hillside of Florence compose EUI\u2019s campus. The library holds the Historical Archives of the European Union (HAEU) and half a million volumes on its area specializations \u2014 attracting researchers from around the globe. Heads of state, leading politicians and visiting professors regularly come to speak at EUI.   Most, if not all, postgraduate and research legal institutes in Europe are very international in terms of the composition of the staff and student body, but few are as diverse as EUI, hosting a community of more than 1000 scholars from over 60 countries. It is a thriving intellectual climate, rich in seminars, conferences, and other academic events.   Famous for centuries as one of the main centers of art and learning in Italy, Florence is now important not only for its collection of art, its museums, and its architecture, but also as the commercial and administrative capital of Tuscany. The city, with approximately 400,000 inhabitants, is extremely active with regards to music, theatre, cinema, sports and recreation. There are two resident orchestras, and several music festivals are held each year.   Dates   Fall only. The academic calendar of the European University Institute consists of three trimesters: September to December; January to mid-April; mid-April to June. Only the first trimester is suitable for NYU students because that is the only semester during which seminars are offered.   Dates below given for reference, for current dates, please refer to the EUI webpages.   Late August: Student registration  Early September: Start of fall semester  Late December: End of fall semester   The detailed academic calendar is available here .   Courses and Credit   EUI\u2019s curriculum is organized around seminars. Seminars meet once a week for two hours per session over the course of ten weeks. NYU students are expected to take five seminars or take 4 seminars and register for a directed research course in NY in order to earn up to 12 credits towards their JD degree. In order to ensure compliance with all ABA regulations, NYU School of Law requires that all courses be approved by our office before your schedule has been finalized.   It is strongly recommended that students preparing for an exchange with EUI enroll in an EU law course before their exchange semester.   For a list of seminars currently being taught at EUI, visit their website.   NYU Law exchange students will receive credit for courses taken at EUI. However, these courses will not count towards the student's GPA. They will only appear on NYU transcripts as credits earned through the exchange program, rather than as individual courses at EUI.   Tuition and Living Expenses   Because this is a revenue-neutral exchange program, participating NYU Law students will pay New York University the normal tuition for a 12 credit-hour semester at NYU Law. Florence is considered to be one of the more expensive Italian cities due to the city's importance as a tourist center year around and its deficiency of residential housing. Transport and service costs are comparable to those in the rest of Italy, but rental property, hotels, restaurants, food and clothing are generally more expensive compared to other Italian cities.   The following table shows what might be the typical monthly expenses for essential services and commodities for a person occupying a single room in a flat-share situation in Florence.     Rent per month: \u20ac450   Electricity per month: \u20ac40   Gas &amp; Heating: \u20ac40   Bus pass: \u20ac35   Supermarket, food, drink, essentials: \u20ac250   EUI lunches: \u20ac70   Breakfast/coffee bar: \u20ac50   Shoes, clothing: \u20ac60   Other expenses: \u20ac80   Leisure: \u20ac200     Inexpensive meals can be had on the EUI campus for \u20ac4. To live comfortably you will probably need about \u20ac1,000 \u2013 \u20ac1,300 per month.     Housing Information   Students may rent Institute apartments short-term. Alternatively, the EUI Housing Office provides information for students seeking private accommodation. Visit the housing site for more information.

Since the documents required to apply for a visa may take some time to gather and the visa itself may take some time to be processed, we recommend students to apply for it as soon as possible to avoid possible delays.   There are Italian consulates located throughout the US: Washington D.C., Detroit, New York, Boston, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and honorary consulates in Kansas City, Denver, St. Paul and St. Louis. Each consulate is designed to service a particular part of the country. Based on your state of residence, be sure to make your application to the appropriate consulate.   Permesso di Soggiorno   (Residence Permit)  As a visiting exchange student, you will be required to obtain this permit from the Central Police Headquarters ( Questura ) in Florence within days of your arrival. Before you depart, please register with Eduitalia who liaise with EUI regarding this matter.   Codice Fiscale   (Tax Number)  During your stay in Florence, you will have to get, sooner rather than later, a Codice Fiscale or tax-code number. It is, in fact, obligatory for all citizens, whether Italian or foreign, to have this number, even though you may not be subject to Italian taxes. You will need a Codice Fiscale for:     opening a bank account   signing any official contract, e.g. the lease for a flat (if the lease is going to be registered)   taking out an Italian insurance policy   taking up employment of any kind   signing contracts with the gas, electric and telephone companies (including mobile phones)     To obtain your tax-code number, simply go to the provincial tax office in Florence ( Ufficio Imposte ) with your passport or national identity card and ask for a Codice Fiscale . You will be given a card with your number.   Access for Persons with Disabilities   If you are interested in the program and will need some special assistance due to a disability, please contact the Office of Global Programs who will contact EUI to obtain information about the availability of needed services.
