David Bowie has kept the music industry, his fans and the world guessing throughout a career that spans over four decades. Bowie himself put his secret best in his prophetic 1972 song, \u201cCh-ch-ch-ch Changes\u201d; a multi-talented performer, writer and visual artist, Bowie has played his career like an instrument, selecting trends of every generation to process, absorb and adapt into successive phases of his ever-evolving chameleon persona. In this day of ceaseless multiple media, Bowie\u2019s most recent, and typically perverse, coup was keeping secret the recording of his 2013 album, The Next Day, over a two-year recording period. The manipulative bravado of knowing when and how to keep a star\u2019s inaccessibility and mystery, or to expose oneself, as Bowie did on TV in his own darkest days, has given David Bowie a singular, enduring mystique, glamour and respect. Examining the arc of his work is a window into significant scenes of every decade since the 1950s, and offers insight into: the British Blues scene that produced the Beatles and the Rolling Stones; the hippy free festival counter-culture; r\u2019n\u2019b; futurism; electronica;glam and gender games, improvisation; soul; funk; dance; disco; minimalism; ambient; avant-garde theater; and above all, the endlessly evolving sound of US and UK young clubland, including recent jungle and garage, to which Bowie consistently returns to recharge and find a new direction to make his own.

She previously developed and taught courses in Reggae and Punk for the Clive Davis Department. Her journalism appears in the New York Times, Black Book, the UK Observer and New Statesman. The most recent of her five books is \"The Book of Exodus: The Making and Meaning of Bob Marley and the Wailers' Album of the Century,\" (Three Rivers Press/Random House) which was described as \"vivid and intimate\" by Rolling Stone. Her second book on Marley, it includes the brief period she spent as his PR at Island Records before the band was famous, right after her graduation from university in the early 1970s. After quitting Bob's PR to become a full-time journalist in the UK rock weeklies, Goldman continued a lengthy association with the label, covering many of their other artists such as Grace Jones, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Aswad, Burning Spear and U2. Combined with her connections with the early US hiphop movement, as Def Jam was forming, Goldman's course offers a unique and revealing insight into the hugely influential history of Jamaica music -- and an entr\u00e9e to parallel worlds that co-exist within popular music itself.
