Generally, as you progress through the curriculum and learn more fundamental engineering science, your courses will involve more design components and more complex design problems.   Design elements are integral to many courses, which lead to the senior process-design courses. In these courses, you will design chemical and biomolecular processes that must include engineering, safety, and economic considerations.
