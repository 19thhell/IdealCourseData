Vice Dean Ingo Walter and Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh have transformed an already outstanding foundation of curriculum and financial research, into a formal Real Estate Finance academic concentration at NYU Stern. This initiative is being driven by a large student demand and increasing corporate recruiting interest, and will complement the Finance department's leadership in finance research, which has generated publications and books such as the recently published Guaranteed to Fail. Stern recognizes that real estate, a core financial asset, is a fundamental part of the economy and business and has taken the next steps to institutionalize the School's pedagogy in the area.

Vice Dean Ingo Walter and Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh have transformed an already outstanding foundation of curriculum and financial research, into a formal Real Estate Finance academic concentration at NYU Stern. This initiative is being driven by a large student demand and increasing corporate recruiting interest, and will complement the Finance department's leadership in finance research, which has generated publications and books such as the recently published Guaranteed to Fail. Stern recognizes that real estate, a core financial asset, is a fundamental part of the economy and business and has taken the next steps to institutionalize the School's pedagogy in the area.
