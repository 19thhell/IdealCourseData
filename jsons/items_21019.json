ITS recommends that you run VPN whenever you connect from a remote location to NYU services that involve sensitive data.                  VPN (Virtual Private Network) is software that provides password-protected access to NYU's network (NYU-NET) and Internet services when you are connecting from off-campus. It is as secure as when you are connected directly to NYU-NET on campus. VPN is required to access some secure NYU services when using a computer outside NYU-NET.      Eligibility   NYU Services That Require VPN   Installing & Using VPN   VPN Support & Troubleshooting      Eligibility   Only current, full-time staff, faculty, and degree students are able to use the VPN service. An active NYU NetID and password are required to both download and use VPN software.     Non-degree students and alumni will not be able to authenticate using VPN.    NYU Services That Require VPN   ITS recommends that you run VPN whenever you connect from a remote location to NYU services that involve sensitive data, but the services below require the use of VPN to successfully connect to them from outside of NYU-NET. Please note: This is a partial list; other NYU services may require a VPN connection.     NYU myTime   PeopleSoft SIS -- Admin  Webspace   FTP to most NYU web servers     Installing & Using VPN   You can find detailed instructions on downloading, configuring, and connecting via VPN in the ServiceLink knowledge base:     Installing and using VPN on a Macintosh computer   Installing and using VPN on a Windows computer   Installing and using VPN on an Android device   Installing and using VPN on an iPhone   Installing and using VPN on an iPad      VPN Support & Troubleshooting   If you have any questions regarding the installation, configuration, or use of NYU VPN, search the ServiceLink knowledge base .   If you are unable to find a solution to your issue, please contact the IT Service Desk at AskITS@nyu.edu or, in New York, at 212-998-3333. For more information on contacting the Service Desk at all NYU locations, please see nyu.edu/its/askits/helpdesk .    Page last reviewed: March 10, 2014"}]},

ITS recommends that you run VPN whenever you connect from a remote location to NYU services that involve sensitive data.                  VPN (Virtual Private Network) is software that provides password-protected access to NYU's network (NYU-NET) and Internet services when you are connecting from off-campus. It is as secure as when you are connected directly to NYU-NET on campus. VPN is required to access some secure NYU services when using a computer outside NYU-NET.      Eligibility   NYU Services That Require VPN   Installing & Using VPN   VPN Support & Troubleshooting      Eligibility   Only current, full-time staff, faculty, and degree students are able to use the VPN service. An active NYU NetID and password are required to both download and use VPN software.     Non-degree students and alumni will not be able to authenticate using VPN.    NYU Services That Require VPN   ITS recommends that you run VPN whenever you connect from a remote location to NYU services that involve sensitive data, but the services below require the use of VPN to successfully connect to them from outside of NYU-NET. Please note: This is a partial list; other NYU services may require a VPN connection.     NYU myTime   PeopleSoft SIS -- Admin  Webspace   FTP to most NYU web servers     Installing & Using VPN   You can find detailed instructions on downloading, configuring, and connecting via VPN in the ServiceLink knowledge base:     Installing and using VPN on a Macintosh computer   Installing and using VPN on a Windows computer   Installing and using VPN on an Android device   Installing and using VPN on an iPhone   Installing and using VPN on an iPad      VPN Support & Troubleshooting   If you have any questions regarding the installation, configuration, or use of NYU VPN, search the ServiceLink knowledge base .   If you are unable to find a solution to your issue, please contact the IT Service Desk at AskITS@nyu.edu or, in New York, at 212-998-3333.
