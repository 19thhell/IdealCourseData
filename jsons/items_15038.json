Excellence in Marketing    At Stern, we strive towards marketing excellence by pioneering research in the industry and tackling real-world matters in the classroom. Ranked as one of the top five departments in the world based on research productivity, our department boasts of over 100 publications in the last three years, about two-thirds of which are in top-tier scholarly journals.        &#8211; Message from the Department Chair          I\u2019m happy to report that this is an exciting time for the department: we have 30 full time tenure-track and clinical faculty--including three terrific young scholars, Andrea Bonezzi, Daria Dzyabura, and Masakazu Ishirara--faculty affiliates Bruce Buchanan, Yuxin Chen of NYU Shanghai, Anindya Ghose and Yaacov Trope, as well as over 40 adjunct faculty members.    Our research contributions continue to be both numerous and impactful. We have sustained our leadership roles in the field with Joel Steckel and Eitan Muller continuing their co-editorships of Marketing Letters and the International Journal of Research in Marketing respectively. Recent appointments include Vicki Morwitz as the new co-editor of the Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) and Russ Winer\u2019s appointment as a Senior Editor of Marketing Science . Professional and school leadership positions continue to be a strong point as Geeta Menon continues in her position as Dean of the Undergraduate College, and Joel Steckel continues as Vice Dean of Doctoral Education. On the programmatic front, our courses and specializations in Entertainment, Media and Technology (EMT ), Luxury and Retail, and Digital Marketing continue to attract MBA and Undergraduate students.    Stern faculty research is frequently featured in The Wall Street Journal , Time , NPR , The New York Times , and other prestigious media outlets.    We are justifiably proud of our doctoral program, as it is one of the best in the world. Our placement record continues to be superb, and we are fortunate to have a strong current group of students. Over the last two years, we have placed students at Harvard Business School, Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, and The Chinese Europe International Business School.    As you can see, our department is in a great place. We have outstanding faculty, a terrific support staff, and a vibrant student community. I hope that you become involved with our Department in some way in the near future.  .          Sincerely,   Priya Raghubir   Department Chair  Dean Abraham L.
