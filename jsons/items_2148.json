A reading of Cervantes's Don Quixote that explores its privileged position as the first modern novel while also attending to the rich and complex historical context from which it emerged.    The Medieval and Renaissance Love Lyric   MEDI-UA 420 Offered periodically. 4 points.   The courtly love lyric, one of the most enduring genres of Western literature, portrayed love as an experience ranging from a degrading passion to an ennobling force, often crucial to poetic inspiration. The course traces the medieval love lyric from its beginnings in 11th-century Provencal through its developments in Latin, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English. Examines how the themes and conventions of this lyric are transformed in the Renaissance by such major love poets as Petrarch, Sidney, Shakespeare, and Donne. Medieval Misogyny MEDI-UA 488 4 points. Beginning with the biblical story of creation and moving through the powerful gendered tradition established by Saint Paul, this course will look at key texts of the Western Middle Ages (in modern English translation) in which men lay down the law, and occasionally, women talk back. Among other works we will take up the letters of Abelard and Heloise, the life of the enclosed Christina of Markyate, the fictive but larger than life Wife of Bath, and the imagined feminine utopia of Christine de Pizan.    Medieval Theatre   MEDI-UA 712 Offered periodically. 4 points.   Survey of medieval theatre in Europe: the plays and their contexts in the church, courts, and carnival.

Beginning with early stories of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table, the course focuses on masterpieces of French, English, and German medieval literature. Through the European literary tradition, students examine larger problems of the development of medieval literature: the conception of history, the rise of the romance genre, the themes of courtly love, the code of chivalry, and philosophical and theological questions as the Arthurian material is developed through the stories of the Holy Grail.    Dante and His World   MEDI-UA 801 Identical to ENGL-UA 143, ITAL-UA 160. Offered every two to three years. Ardizzone, Freccero. 4 points.

Acting Medieval Literature   MEDI-UA 868 Identical to FREN-UA 868, THEA-UT 732. Offered regularly. Vitz. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of books to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, performing a substantial piece of narrative poetry, singing or playing a body of medieval songs, or choosing a similar activity. Works studied/performed include songs of the troubadours and trouveres; The Song of Roland; Chretien de Troyes's romance, Yvain; French fabliaux; and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

Study of the kinds of loves and desires portrayed in medieval literature: passionate love; refined \"courtly\" love; sexual or \"carnal\" love; love of kin; love of country; love of God. Discusses how literary genres can be largely defined by the nature of the desires represented, explores medieval theorists' views of human love, and investigates the conflicts among different kinds of love for medieval people.    Internship   MEDI-UA 980, 981 Prerequisite: written permission of the director of the program. Restricted to majors and minors. 1 to 4 points per term.

The second semester begins with English Restoration and 18th-century comedy and continues through romanticism, naturalism, and realism to an examination of antirealism and the major dramatic currents of the 20th century, including postcolonial theatre in Asia, Africa, and Australia.    Advanced Electives in Dramatic Literature    Acting Medieval Literature   DRLIT-UA 35 Identical to MEDI-UA 868. 4 points.   Presents medieval literature as a set of springboards to performance rather than as a series of \"books\" to be read. In this strongly performance-oriented course, students approach this \"literature\" as works that were acted out, sung, and narrated from memory as part of a storytelling tradition. Students are invited to draw on their dramatic and musical skills and interests, and stage medieval works. For their final project, students participate in staging and putting on a play, perform a substantial piece of narrative poetry, sing or play a body of medieval songs, or a similar endeavor.    Naturalism   DRLIT-UA 113 Identical to THEA-UA 705. 4 points.   A study of the origins and development of the most influential dramatic movements of the 20th century.

A study of the various formal movements that developed in reaction to realism. After examining several 19th-century antecedents, including Buchner, we study the most important experimental styles of each successive era: symbolism, expressionism, surrealism, epic theatre, the theatre of the absurd, and postmodernism. Authors covered include Maeterlinck, Kaiser, Pirandello, Lorca, Beckett, Genet, Bond, Handke, Muller, and Benmussa. The philosophical context is explored through reading Freud, Marx, Sartre, and Derrida; theoretical readings include essays by Artaud and Brecht. While the class focus is on the many styles that evolved in the 20th-century search for a more expressive form, some attention is given to how this search still very much influences theatre artists today.    Theory of Drama   DRLIT-UA 130 Identical to ENGL-UA 130. 4 points.   Explores the relationship between two kinds of theories: theories of meaning and theories of practice. Among the theories of meaning to be studied are semiotics, deconstruction, feminism, psychoanalysis, new historicism, and postmodernism. Theories of practice include naturalism, dadaism, futurism, epic theatre, theatre of cruelty, poor theatre, and environmental theatre. Theories are examined through theoretical essays and representative plays.    Gay and Lesbian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 137 Identical to THEA-UA 624. 4 points.   A survey of contemporary lesbian and gay plays from The Boys in the Band to Angels in America. The goal is to familiarize students with lesbian and gay plays written since 1968 as a discrete body of work within the field of contemporary theatre. The course focuses on plays and playwrights that have had a significant impact in the representation of homosexual life onstage. In addition, students consider the historical, political, and cultural developments from which gay theatre emerged and, through independent research projects, examine the communities that emerged in the process of creating gay theatre.    Popular Performance   DRLIT-UA 138 Identical to THEA-UA 621. 4 points.

Exploration of what popular performance does differently than \"high culture\" theatre, how it does so, and to whom it addresses itself. A study of characteristic forms and techniques of popular performance, the connection between Western and non-Western forms, and the central role of popular performance in 20th-century theatre.    Topics in Italian Culture: Futurism in Italy   DRLIT-UA 174 Identical to ITAL-UA 173. 4 points.   Arguably the first avant-garde movement of the 20th century, futurism saw itself as a violent explosion that would drastically redefine not only the artistic landscape but reality as a whole. The futurists produced a theoretical program to overhaul literature, painting, theatre, architecture, music, politics, and even cooking. The approach of the movement's 100th birthday is an opportunity to assess its relevance for our understanding of modernity. This is an interdisciplinary course.

Explores the richness and variety of Shakespearean drama through an emphasis on the mastery of selected major plays. Six to eight plays are read intensively and examined thoroughly in discussion.    Restoration and 18th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 235 4 points.   The Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660 brought an end to a 20-year period of civil war and military rule in England. As a postwar culture, Restoration England was a divided society, but also a society ripe for social change and cultural innovation. The London public theatres in this period, reopened after twenty years of prohibition, can be variously characterized as progressive vanguard and conservative rearguard, both an open forum for new ideas and subversive critique of the dominant culture, and a bastion of aristocratic privilege and state hegemony. This course considers the cultural activity of the Restoration public theatres from both outlooks. Embracing the divided nature of the art and culture of this period, the readings are organized into a series of unlikely pairings: urban comedies and classical tragedies, closet dramas and box-office successes, propaganda pieces and broad satires, puritan reform and libertine excess. Playwrights include Dryden, Davenant, Cavendish, Etherege, Wycherley, Rochester, Milton, Centlivre, Shadwell, Otway, and Farquhar.

Theatrical Genres   DRLIT-UA 251 Identical to THEA-UA 632. 4 points.   This course (different each time) explores one or more distinctive theatrical genres, such as tragedy, comedy, melodrama, satire, or farce, or plays of distinctive theatrical types, such as theatre of the absurd, the documentary play, or theatre of witness. Since theatrical genres and theatrical types come into being because playwrights respond to historical necessity by visualizing specific worldviews, the course presents a study of the role and function of the theatre within societies, as a response to historical, psychological, and spiritual forces.    Modern U.S. Drama   DRLIT-UA 253 Identical to ENGL-UA 650, THEA-UA 608. 4 points.

We explore these writers and their texts as they relate to the page, to the stage, and to U.S. culture at large. We discuss how these writers (and others) represent themselves and notions of \"American-ness\" in their dramatic works. We include important works from the margins, as well as those that represent the mainstream. Does modern U.S. drama lead or follow U.S. culture? Does it tend to be a design for living or a reflection of custom? We also explore the role of gender in culture as demonstrated in these works. Does U.S. drama question the status quo or reinforce it? These and other interrogations inform our readings, discussions, and written assignments.    Major Playwrights   DRLIT-UA 254 Identical to ENGL-UA 652, THEA-UA 618. 4 points.

Issues of race, gender, class; of oppression and empowerment; of marginality and assimilation are explored in the works of such playwrights as Langston Hughes, Alice Childress, Lorraine Hansberry, Amiri Baraka, Adrienne Kennedy, Charles Fuller, George C. Wolfe, Ntozake Shange, August Wilson, Suzan-Lori Parks, and Anna Deavere Smith. The sociohistorical context of each author is also briefly explored. Asian American Theatre   DRLIT-UA 256 Identical to THEA-UA 606. 4 points.   Acts as both an introduction to the genre of Asian American theatre and an interrogation into how this genre has been constituted. Through a combination of play analysis and historical discussion\u2014starting with Frank Chen's The Chickencoop Chinaman, the first Asian American play produced in a mainstream venue\u2014the class looks at the ways Asian American drama and performance intersect with a burgeoning Asian American consciousness. We review the construction of Asian American history through such plays as Genny Lim's Paper Angels and more recent works such as Chay Yew's A Language of Their Own. We also read theoretical and historical texts that provide the basis for a critical examination of the issues surrounding Asian American theatre. Orientalism, media representation, and theories of genealogy inform our discussion.    Political Theatre   DRLIT-UA 258 Identical to THEA-UA 622. 4 points.   Major forms, plays, and theories of socially engaged theatre exemplifying performance as a site of resistance, social critique, and utopianism.

Comparative Study: 20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 261 4 points.   The two decades or so following World War II were a particularly exciting period in the history of drama in Europe and America. This course focuses on five playwrights\u2014Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Adrienne Kennedy, and Peter Weiss\u2014whose engagements with postwar history and politics shaped the form and content of their works for the stage. Questions include modes of representing historical experience, theatre and historical forms of spectatorship, and challenges to genre. The presumption is that we cannot know in advance what it means to describe a play as \"political.\" Readings include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Endgame, and selected shorter plays; Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire and Orpheus Descending; Genet's The Balcony, The Blacks, and The Screens; Kennedy's Funnyhouse of a Negro, The Owl Answers, and A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White; and Weiss's Marat/Sade and The Investigation.    17th-Century Theatre   DRLIT-UA 290 4 points.   Explores plays written by Shakespeare's collaborators, rivals, and followers\u2014English drama in the age of Shakespeare written by playwrights other than Shakespeare. These are plays about world-conquering heroes, murderous conspirators, riotous good-fellows, and star-crossed lovers; they are also about the fast-changing culture of early modern England, dealing with new patterns of urban life, emergent notions of republican politics and personal liberty, the discovery of new worlds and new sciences, and the increasing pressures of European war, revolution, and civil war. A different play each week. Plays by Beaumont, Brome, Dekker, Fletcher, Ford, Jonson, Marlowe, Massinger, Middleton, Milton, Shirley, and Webster.    Theatre of Latin America   DRLIT-UA 293 Identical to THEA-UA 748. 4 points.   An introduction to the history, theories, and practices of Latin American drama, focusing on the 20th century. We pay special attention to the historical reinvention of European-based theatrical forms in the Americas through their continuous interaction with non-European cultural forms. Through the plays of leading dramatists\u2014including Jorge Diaz, Egon Wolff, and Sergio Vodanovic (Chile); Jose Triana (Cuba); Rene Marquez and Luis Rafael Sanchez (Puerto Rico); Isaac Chocron (Venezuela); Emilio Carballido, Luisa Josefina Hernandez, Sabina Berman, and Elena Garro (Mexico); and Osvaldo Dragun, Eduardo Pavlovsky, Roberto Cossa, and Griselda Gambaro (Argentina)\u2014we explore the significance of modernist and postmodernist dramatic forms in cultures where industrial modernity is an insecure social context. We study the wealth of oppositional theatre in Latin America\u2014exemplified by Augusto Boal's \"theatre of the oppressed\"\u2014in relation to the historical use (or abuse) of theatrical spectacle as a political means to control peoples, from the early Spanish conquerors to recent authoritarian state leaders. We read postcolonial Latin American theories of culture and art, such as hybridity, transculturation, Brazil's modernist and anticolonial antropofagia, and the \"aesthetics of hunger,\" drawing on the work of Fernando Ortiz, Angel Rama, and Nestor Garcia Canclini, among others. We consider \"magical realism\" in the theatre as a social poetics of scarcity.    Theatre in Asia   DRLIT-UA 294 Identical to THEA-UA 744. 4 points.

Emphasis is placed on theatrical forms that have been influenced by the theories of Artaud and the European avant-garde; John Cage and visual aesthetics related to American acting, painting, collage, and environmental and conceptual art. Types of performance studied include dadaist, surrealist, and futurist plays; multimedia happenings of Karpov, Oldenberg, and Whitman; conceptual self-works and solos of performers such as Vito Acconci, Karen Finley, Spalding Gray, and Diamanda Galas; and the work of avant-gardists such as Richard Foreman, Robert Wilson, Meredith Monk, Ping Chong, Mabou Mines, LeCompte's Wooster Group, and Pina Bausch. Readings are supplemented by slides, videotape, and attendance at suggested performance events.    Drama in Performance   DRLIT-UA 300 Identical to ENGL-UA 132. 4 points.

Contemporary European Theatre   DRLIT-UA 609 4 points.   The European theatre scene of the last two decades has witnessed the emergence of a new wave of dramatists who share a dark, desperate, depressive, yet humorous Weltanschauung and style. They have encountered controversy and shock in reception but could not be ignored, gradually gaining a significant place in recent theatre history. We study and discuss work by Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, David Harrower, Roland Schimmelpfennig, Koffi Kwahule, Yasmina Reza, Juan Mayorga, Biljana Srbljanovi, Gianina Carbunariu, Hristo Boytchev, Matei Visniec, Goran Stefanovski, Vassily Sigarev, and their forerunners Beckett, Ionesco, Orton, Churchill, Koltes, Havel, Mrozek, et al.    Irish Dramatists   DRLIT-UA 700 Identical to THEA-UA 603, IRISH-UA 700. 4 points.

Playwrights covered include John Millington Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Brendan Behan, Brian Friel, Tom Murphy, Frank McGuinness, and Anne Devlin. Issues of Irish identity, history, and postcoloniality are engaged alongside an appreciation of the emotional texture, poetic achievements, and theatrical innovations that characterize this body of dramatic work.    Gender and Performance in the Italian Theatre   DRLIT-UA 720 Identical to ITAL-UA 720. 4 points.   Examines plays that explicitly highlight and question the status and performance of gender, as well as selections from political treatises, books of manners, and historiography of the early modern period (1350-1700). Topics such as cross-dressing, the emergence of the actress and commedia dell'arte troupes, the dynamics of spectatorship, the development of perspective in painting and theatre, and court power relations are considered, as well as the \"revisions\" that women playwrights and writers made to a largely male-dominated canon.    20th-Century Drama   DRLIT-UA 730 4 points.   Transportable Drama: Stock character types, dramatic figures, and archetypal plots are to a certain extent independent and transportable terms that appear and reappear in multiple play texts, versions of those texts, and in diverse media. Beyond that, the experience of what we call \"drama\" is not limited to play texts and their presentation; it is present in fiction, news, film, television, the visual and electronic arts, and advertising. In this course, we explore how the dramatic impulse of several plots, figures, and characters is expressed in play texts and other media across several historical periods. For example, we may choose to look at Zola's novel and play of Therese Raquin, followed by Marcel Carne's 20th-century film adaptation. Or, we might examine one or more of the historical Don Juan plays in combination with the Byron poem, the Mozart opera, and/or a modern film treatment. Similarly, Shakespearean texts have been widely adapted to the present day, not only in theatrical spin-offs and films, but also through renderings by visual artists. A play based upon a news event, such as Treadwell's Machinal, may be examined in light of the original reportage and public records. By looking at clusters of related works in tandem, rather than as freestanding objects of study, we will gain a greater understanding of drama as a transportable art form and of adaptation in both its practical and theoretical aspects.

This course (different every time) introduces students to the specific choices that a director must make to transform the \"printed word\" into a visual auditory experience. For example, point of view becomes a challenge of camera shots; a described room becomes a matter of lighting, color, and sound; and the sense of time becomes a product of editing, rhythm, music, and splicing. Throughout the course, we pit a director's view against an author's view to examine how the same story may express different agendas, depending on the rendering. Works may include Euripides' Medea (Pasolini), Nabokov's Lolita (Kubrick), Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire (Kazan), Paul Schrader's Taxi Driver (Scorsese), Virginia Woolf's Orlando (Potter), and Thomas Hardy's Tess (Polanski).

The intern's duties on-site should involve some substantive aspect of work in drama. The student is expected to fulfill the obligation of the internship itself, and a written evaluation is solicited from the outside sponsor at the end. The grade for the course is based on a final project submitted to a faculty director with whom the student has been meeting regularly over the semester to discuss the progress of the internship.    Independent Study   DRLIT-UA 997, 998 Prerequisite: permission of the director of undergraduate studies. May not duplicate the content of a regularly offered course.

Requires a paper of considerable length that should embody the results of a semester's reading, thinking, and frequent conferences with the student's director. The paper should show the student's ability to investigate, collect, and evaluate his or her material, finally drawing conclusions that are discussed in a sound and well-written argument. In the 2-point course, the student is held to the same high standard as is the student who is working for 4 points, but the investigation and the paper are of proportionate length.    Honors Seminar    The subject of the Honors Seminar changes each year and is decided on by the faculty member teaching the seminar. The seminar is a small class (limited to 12) that ideally prepares students for the senior thesis; the primary focus is on research and the application of critical methodologies. Each year, one of the Department of English Junior Honors Seminars is also designated as the drama studies Honors Seminar, with at least a partial focus on drama. Drama studies majors normally take this seminar to complete the seminar requirement. (English majors in honors may also take this designated seminar if they choose to, subject to the 12-student limit.) Dramatic literature majors in honors may also satisfy the seminar requirement by taking, with the instructor's permission, the Honors Seminar in the undergraduate Department of Drama at Tisch School of the Arts.    Admission to the Drama Studies honors program is competitive. The Honors Seminars are limited to 12 students. The minimum GPA for admission to any College of Arts and Science honors program is 3.65 or better (both overall and in the major). In addition, students must have completed the two core courses History of Drama and Theatre I and II (DRLIT-UA 110 and 111) by the end of the semester in which they apply for the honors track.
