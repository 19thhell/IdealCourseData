A standing committee of three faculty is devoted to job placement. In the spring term prior to the job-hunting season, this committee holds an orientation about the process and distributes a comprehensive handbook that includes sample job letters, cv\u2019s, and other materials. As the job season unfolds, the placement committee maintains frequent contact with job seekers and advisors, offering further support with respect to recommendation letters, writing samples, and professional networks. Most importantly, it holds a series of events that address different stages of the process (see below) including mock interviews with students prior to the MLA conference, and a workshop on the teaching portfolio. The committee also arranges mock job talks for students receiving campus visits. Securing a tenure-track job in the current climate typically entails more than one year of comprehensive searching, and the placement committee continues to work with students for as long as it takes. NYU also offers a range of post-doctoral teaching fellowships to support students along the way. Graduates of NYU\u2019s English department are scholars and teachers all over the country, and the world, at large research universities (UC Berkeley, Brandeis, Yale, University of Nebraska, University of Texas, Cornell, American University of Beirut), small liberal arts colleges (Iona, Whitman, Connecticut, Rhodes) and a range of institutions in between.

Summer: Dossier Preparation In consultation with students\u2019 advisors, the committee works with students as they prepare cover letters, dissertation abstracts, cv\u2019s and statements of teaching philosophy. Each dossier undergoes 3 rounds of editing, by all members of the placement committee who meet with students individually until the dossier is ready for submission for advertised positions and fellowships. Fall: Introductory Meeting The placement committee meets with job seekers to discuss the contours of the job market, field questions and map out application strategies. \u201cWorkshop on the Teaching Portfolio\u201d This workshop answers questions regarding the preparation and presentation of the teaching portfolio (syllabi, evaluations, teaching philosophy etc.). What should be included? How best to present data? What makes a teaching statement compelling? This year\u2019s workshop was led by Professor Sonya Posmentier and Professor Nicholas Boggs. \u201cWorkshop on the Postdoctoral Fellowship Application\u201d This workshop considers the unique genre of the fellowship application. How does this application differ from a standard cover letter? What makes a compelling research statement? This year\u2019s workshop was led by our two current ACLS fellows, Dr. Elizabeth Twitchell and Dr. Gregory Vargo. \u201cMock Interview Workshop\u201d The mock interview workshop prepares students for answering questions on their research and teaching. Students are given questions/exercises to prepare in advance and are timed and given feedback on their responses. Winter: MLA interviews and interview support \u201cMock Job Talks\u201d Students present their job talks to faculty and students, field questions from the \"audience\" and receive feedback on their research and presentation from both specialist and non-specialist listeners.
