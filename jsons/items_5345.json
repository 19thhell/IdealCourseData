Join us as acclaimed economist Dr. Michael Greenstone discusses revelatory new research on the impact of variations in weather on well-being in India. The results indicate that high temperatures dramatically increase mortality rates; for example, 1 additional day with a mean temperature above 32\u00b0 C, relative to a day in the 22\u00b0 - 24\u00b0 C range, increases the annual mortality rate by 0.9% in rural areas. This effect appears to be related to substantial reductions in the income of agricultural laborers due to these same hot days. Finally, the estimated temperature-mortality relationship and state of the art climate change projections reveal a substantial increase in mortality due to climate change, which greatly exceeds the expected impact in the US and other developed countries. Michael Greenstone is the 3M Professor of Environmental Economics in the Department of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He also is a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at Brookings. His research is focused on estimating the costs and benefits of environmental quality. He has worked extensively on the Clean Air Act and examined its impacts on air quality, manufacturing activity, housing prices, and infant mortality to assess its costs and benefits. He is currently engaged in a large scale project to estimate the economic costs of climate change. Other current projects include examinations of: the benefits of the Superfund program; the economic and health impacts of indoor air pollution in Orissa, India; individual's revealed value of a statistical life; the impact of air pollution on infant mortality in developing countries; and the costs of biodiversity. Greenstone is also interested in the consequences of government regulation, more generally. He is conducting or has conducted research on: the effects of federal antidiscrimination laws on black infant mortality rates; the impacts of mandated disclosure laws on equity markets; and the welfare consequences of state and local subsidies given to businesses that locate within their jurisdictions. He is a member of the Environmental Economics Advisory Committee of EPA's Science Advisory Board and his research has been funded by the NSF, NIH, and EPA.

Their study, which appears in the Journal of Politics , found that those living in places experiencing warmer-than-normal temperatures at the time they were surveyed were significantly more likely than others to say there is evidence for global warming.   \u201cGlobal climate change is one of the most important public policy challenges of our time, but it is a complex issue with which Americans have little direct experience,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s co-authors, Patrick Egan of New York University and Megan Mullin of Temple University. \u201cAs they try to make sense of this difficult issue, many people use fluctuations in local temperature to reassess their beliefs about the existence of global warming.\u201d   Their study examined five national surveys of American adults sponsored by the Pew Research Center: June, July, and August 2006, January 2007, and April 2008. In each survey, respondents were asked the following question: \u201cFrom what you\u2019ve read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?\u201d On average over the five surveys, 73 percent of respondents agreed that the earth is getting warmer.   Egan and Mullin wondered about variation in attitudes among the survey\u2019s respondents, and hypothesized that local temperatures could influence perceptions. To measure the potential impact of temperature on individuals\u2019 opinions, they looked at zip codes from respondents in the Pew surveys and matched weather data to each person surveyed at the time of each poll. They used local weather data to determine if the temperature in the location of each respondent was significantly higher or lower than normal for that area at that time of year.   Their results showed that an abnormal shift in local temperature is associated with a significant shift in beliefs about evidence for global warming. Specifically, for every three degrees Fahrenheit that local temperatures in the past week have risen above normal, Americans become one percentage point more likely to agree that there is \u2018\u2018solid evidence\u2019\u2019 that the earth is getting warmer. The researchers found cooler-than-normal temperatures have similar effects on attitudes\u2014but in the opposite direction.   The study took into account other variables that may explain the results\u2014such as existing political attitudes and geography\u2014and found the results still held.   The researchers also wondered if heat waves\u2014or prolonged higher-than-normal temperatures\u2014intensified this effect. To do so, they looked at respondents living in areas that experienced at least seven days of temperatures of 10\u00b0 or more above normal in the three weeks prior to interview and compared their views with those who experienced the same number of hot days, but did not experience a heat wave.   Their estimates showed that the effect of a heat wave on opinion is even greater, increasing the share of Americans believing in global warming by 5.0 to 5.9 percentage points.   However, Egan and Mullin found the effects of temperature changes to be short-lived\u2014even in the wake of heat waves. Americans who had been interviewed after 12 or more days had elapsed since a heat wave were estimated to have attitudes that were no different than those who had not been exposed to a heat wave.   \u201cUnder typical circumstances, the effects of temperature fluctuations on opinion are swiftly wiped out by new weather patterns,\u201d they wrote. \u201cMore sustained periods of unusual weather cause attitudes to change both to a greater extent and for a longer period of time. However, even these effects eventually decay, leaving no long-term impact of weather on public opinion.\u201d   The findings make an important contribution to the political science research on the relationship between personal experience and opinion on a larger issue, which has long been studied with varying results.   \u201cOn issues such as crime, the economy, education, health care, public infrastructure, and taxation, large shares of the public are exposed to experiences that could logically be linked to attitude formation,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cBut findings from research examining how these experiences affect opinion have been mixed. Although direct experience\u2014whether it be as a victim of crime, a worker who has lost a job or health insurance, or a parent with children in public schools\u2014can influence attitudes, the impact of these experiences tends to be weak or nonexistent after accounting for typical predictors such as party identification and liberal-conservative ideology.\u201d   \u201cOur research suggests that personal experience has substantial effects on political attitudes,\u201d Egan and Mullin concluded. \u201cRich discoveries await those who can explore these questions in ways that permit clean identification of these effects.\u201d   Egan is an assistant professor in the Wilf Family Department of Politics at NYU and Mullin is an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at Temple University.
