Description       The Quest for the Holy Grail has captured the modern Western imagination, spawning bestselling fiction, scholarly and conspiratorial study, and no fewer than fourteen feature films dating back to the silent era. Yet our twentieth-century fascination with the legendary Cup is only the most recent incarnation of a long obsession in popular Western culture\u2014an obsession that reaches back in time to at least the twelfth century, and possibly earlier still. In this course, the legend of the Holy Grail will serve as a case study for learning about the Middle Ages and medievalism in our world today. We will study the flourishing of the Grail legend in medieval courtly society, but we will think about other \u201cGrails\u201d as well: quests for the unknown, the unseen, and the unconquered; fascination with conspiracy; and above all, the hope that human beings invest in symbols, not just of the divine, but also of transcendent kindness, compassion, and sacrifice. Readings will include\u00a0 Beowulf \u00a0, the\u00a0 Perceval \u00a0legends of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach, Robert de Boron\u2019s\u00a0 Merlin \u00a0, and Thomas Malory\u2019s\u00a0 Le Morte d\u2019Arthur. \u00a0We will examine our modern associations of the Grail legend with Christian femininity, the Knights Templar, the Papacy, and Leonardo da Vinci. And in dialogue with theorists of anthropology, political science, psychology, and comparative mythology, we will discuss why we pursue holy grails in the first place\u2014what keeps us striving for those tantalizing, ultimately unreachable goals that nevertheless compel us ever forward.

For thinkers from Leibniz to Sontag to Badiou, and in recent controversies around Ai Weiwei as much as FoxConn, determining how China and the Chinese are (or ought to be) like or unlike other states and cultures has sounded out essential questions about governance, human rights, civilizational progress, epistemology, and the bounds of fellow-feeling. Guided by the history of diplomatic, economic, and cultural exchanges between China and the Western world, this course is built around several key tropes that have persisted adaptively throughout that history, such as despotism and internationalism, the laboring body and the revolutionary masses. Our emphasis is on critical analysis of the political as well as the aesthetic imagination. Writing assignments consist of weekly response papers, a midterm essay, and a final research project. Readings span literature, history, political philosophy, critical theory, and travel writing. We also scrutinize several works of art, film, theatre, and performance.

Description       The Quest for the Holy Grail has captured the modern Western imagination, spawning bestselling fiction, scholarly and conspiratorial study, and no fewer than fourteen feature films dating back to the silent era. Yet our twentieth-century fascination with the legendary Cup is only the most recent incarnation of a long obsession in popular Western culture\u2014an obsession that reaches back in time to at least the twelfth century, and possibly earlier still. In this course, the legend of the Holy Grail will serve as a case study for learning about the Middle Ages and medievalism in our world today. We will study the flourishing of the Grail legend in medieval courtly society, but we will think about other \u201cGrails\u201d as well: quests for the unknown, the unseen, and the unconquered; fascination with conspiracy; and above all, the hope that human beings invest in symbols, not just of the divine, but also of transcendent kindness, compassion, and sacrifice. Readings will include\u00a0 Beowulf \u00a0, the\u00a0 Perceval \u00a0legends of Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and Wolfram von Eschenbach, Robert de Boron\u2019s\u00a0 Merlin \u00a0, and Thomas Malory\u2019s\u00a0 Le Morte d\u2019Arthur. \u00a0We will examine our modern associations of the Grail legend with Christian femininity, the Knights Templar, the Papacy, and Leonardo da Vinci. And in dialogue with theorists of anthropology, political science, psychology, and comparative mythology, we will discuss why we pursue holy grails in the first place\u2014what keeps us striving for those tantalizing, ultimately unreachable goals that nevertheless compel us ever forward.

For thinkers from Leibniz to Sontag to Badiou, and in recent controversies around Ai Weiwei as much as FoxConn, determining how China and the Chinese are (or ought to be) like or unlike other states and cultures has sounded out essential questions about governance, human rights, civilizational progress, epistemology, and the bounds of fellow-feeling. Guided by the history of diplomatic, economic, and cultural exchanges between China and the Western world, this course is built around several key tropes that have persisted adaptively throughout that history, such as despotism and internationalism, the laboring body and the revolutionary masses. Our emphasis is on critical analysis of the political as well as the aesthetic imagination. Writing assignments consist of weekly response papers, a midterm essay, and a final research project. Readings span literature, history, political philosophy, critical theory, and travel writing. We also scrutinize several works of art, film, theatre, and performance.
