Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

Private schools offer programs in Nursery, N-5th grade, JrK- 5th grade, K-8, or K-12.   Classrooms in private schools vary in size however are typically smaller than classrooms found in public school settings.   Independent private schools manage their own budgets, admissions process, and have the independence to create their own curriculum and articulate a unique educational vision and philosophy.   Many private schools provide students with enriched opportunities to explore the sciences, arts, sports, music, community service and a wide array of curricular options.   School tuition varies from $15K to $40K. Needs based scholarships are available at all private schools; a single application and assessment form determines need.     The Application Process     The majority of NYC\u2019s private independent schools are members of ISAAGNY, the Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York , a non-profit organization that establishes a consistent set of admission timelines, practices, and guidelines.   The application process for all private independent schools begins the year before admission is sought, with applications typically available on-line the day after Labor Day.   All schools require a written application, tour or open house, parent and child interviews.   Most of the schools require that student applicants (K-12) be assessed with a standard assessment test offered by the Education Records Bureau (ERB) . Fee reductions for the ERB tests are available through a partnership of the ERB and ISAAGNY.   Some schools will accept an alternate test, the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) for students entering in Grade 5-11. Be sure to check with the schools to which you are applying.   All application materials must be completed as early as November and as late as December. It is important to keep track of all deadlines.   Decisions are typically mailed to families between mid-February and early March. Exact dates are available on the websites of individual schools and ISAAGNY .     Eligibility     The birthday cutoff for placement purposes is August 31 for most private schools. Therefore, a child must be 5 years old on or before August 31 of the year they enroll to be eligible for Kindergarten.   Families seeking admission to a private school admission are strongly encouraged to visit and register their child for public school [link: to come] and participate in the public school choice programs [link: to come], as appropriate or desired.     Determining School Options     ISAAGNY (described above) includes quick links to all of its member schools.   The Parent\u2019s League of New York , a membership organization that works on behalf of NYC private independent schools and parents, offers parent education programs, school fairs, an advisory service, and publications on NYC schools and enrichment offerings.   Early Steps supports families of color who are seeking private school placement for their children seeking enrollment in Kindergarten and First Grade. See the Resource List for organizations that work to identify and support middle and high school students.   Several organizations work to identify and support private school admissions for middle and high school students of color.                         Need Assistance?   The Parents League of New York sponsors school fairs, information sessions for parents, and consultation on school options.

The birthday cutoff for school registration is December 31. Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

Private schools offer programs in Nursery, N-5th grade, JrK- 5th grade, K-8, or K-12.   Classrooms in private schools vary in size however are typically smaller than classrooms found in public school settings.   Independent private schools manage their own budgets, admissions process, and have the independence to create their own curriculum and articulate a unique educational vision and philosophy.   Many private schools provide students with enriched opportunities to explore the sciences, arts, sports, music, community service and a wide array of curricular options.   School tuition varies from $15K to $40K. Needs based scholarships are available at all private schools; a single application and assessment form determines need.     The Application Process     The majority of NYC\u2019s private independent schools are members of ISAAGNY, the Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York , a non-profit organization that establishes a consistent set of admission timelines, practices, and guidelines.   The application process for all private independent schools begins the year before admission is sought, with applications typically available on-line the day after Labor Day.   All schools require a written application, tour or open house, parent and child interviews.   Most of the schools require that student applicants (K-12) be assessed with a standard assessment test offered by the Education Records Bureau (ERB) . Fee reductions for the ERB tests are available through a partnership of the ERB and ISAAGNY.   Some schools will accept an alternate test, the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) for students entering in Grade 5-11. Be sure to check with the schools to which you are applying.   All application materials must be completed as early as November and as late as December. It is important to keep track of all deadlines.   Decisions are typically mailed to families between mid-February and early March. Exact dates are available on the websites of individual schools and ISAAGNY .     Eligibility     The birthday cutoff for placement purposes is August 31 for most private schools. Therefore, a child must be 5 years old on or before August 31 of the year they enroll to be eligible for Kindergarten.   Families seeking admission to a private school admission are strongly encouraged to visit and register their child for public school [link: to come] and participate in the public school choice programs [link: to come], as appropriate or desired.     Determining School Options     ISAAGNY (described above) includes quick links to all of its member schools.   The Parent\u2019s League of New York , a membership organization that works on behalf of NYC private independent schools and parents, offers parent education programs, school fairs, an advisory service, and publications on NYC schools and enrichment offerings.   Early Steps supports families of color who are seeking private school placement for their children seeking enrollment in Kindergarten and First Grade. See the Resource List for organizations that work to identify and support middle and high school students.   Several organizations work to identify and support private school admissions for middle and high school students of color.                         Need Assistance?   The Parents League of New York sponsors school fairs, information sessions for parents, and consultation on school options.

The birthday cutoff for school registration is December 31. Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

Many private schools provide students with enriched opportunities to explore the sciences, arts, sports, music, community service and a wide array of curricular options.   School tuition varies from $15K to $40K. Needs based scholarships are available at all private schools; a single application and assessment form determines need.     The Application Process     The majority of NYC\u2019s private independent schools are members of ISAAGNY, the Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York , a non-profit organization that establishes a consistent set of admission timelines, practices, and guidelines.   The application process for all private independent schools begins the year before admission is sought, with applications typically available on-line the day after Labor Day.   All schools require a written application, tour or open house, parent and child interviews.   Most of the schools require that student applicants (K-12) be assessed with a standard assessment test offered by the Education Records Bureau (ERB) . Fee reductions for the ERB tests are available through a partnership of the ERB and ISAAGNY.   Some schools will accept an alternate test, the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) for students entering in Grade 5-11. Be sure to check with the schools to which you are applying.   All application materials must be completed as early as November and as late as December. It is important to keep track of all deadlines.   Decisions are typically mailed to families between mid-February and early March. Exact dates are available on the websites of individual schools and ISAAGNY .

The birthday cutoff for school registration is December 31. Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

The birthday cutoff for school registration is December 31. Therefore, students are eligible to apply for Kindergarten during the year of they turn 5 years old and Pre-K the year they turn 4 years old.   Public Kindergarten in NYC is offered for a full school day (typically 8:40 a.m.-2:50 p.m.). Kindergarten attendance is optional in NYC, however, if desired, children of NYC residents are guaranteed enrollment in a local public school beginning in Kindergarten. Children must enroll in school by the First Grade.   Like other communities across the country, children are typically assigned to schools based on their home address. These schools, known as \u201czoned schools,\u201d serve all children in a designated geographical catchment area. You can find your zoned school on the NYC Department of Education's website or by contacting NYC's Information Line, 311.   There are more than 700 public elementary schools, including 140 K-8 programs in NYC. During the elementary school years, the majority of families are comfortable with their children attending their zoned neighborhood school. Some families however seek other options and have their children evaluated for public gifted and talented programs , identify bi-lingual or dual language programs , or consider charter schools in their home neighborhood or elsewhere.   Evaluating Elementary School For Your Child   As you consider the variety of education options in NYC, it is important that you visit your local zoned school to get to know the school where your child is guaranteed a seat. Be reflective as you consider what is most important to you. No school will have every quality you want, but if you know what matters most to you, you will find an educational option where your child can thrive.     How does your child\u2019s nursery school teacher or Director describe your child in a classroom setting? What are their suggestions for schools or classrooms?   Does your child prefer activities regulated by the teacher? Or the students?   Does she enjoy structure in her day? Does he work best when the expectations are clearly outlined and defined? Does your child enjoy open-ended activities? Does she enjoy being challenged?   Does he prefer to work alone? Does she thrive when working in collaborative group projects?   Could she benefit from a classroom where different learning styles and abilities are mixed in one classroom? Would she thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities?   Are you comfortable with the educational philosophy, pedagogy, and curriculum offered by the school? What is the school\u2019s philosophy on homework?   Are the classrooms diverse and comprised of students with different learning styles and abilities? Are children tracked by ability? Where would your child thrive in a setting with students of similar abilities or a mixed group? Are you more comfortable within homogeneous or heterogeneous groupings?   Would your child feel most comfortable in a small school setting? A larger K-8th grade school? Or just elementary school students? How do the younger students interact with the older students in the school?   What are the facilities like and how important are they to you? Is the outdoor space within the school, or must students walk a distance to a park?   Can you and your child handle commuting by bus or train to school? Or is a school within walking distance preferred?   Are there opportunities for your child to explore sports, arts, drama, and music? Are there science labs? Is there a library in the classroom and/or one serving the whole school?   Does the school take advantage of the public library and other community resources?   How involved are parents in the school? In what kinds of activities are they engaged?

Private schools offer programs in Nursery, N-5th grade, JrK- 5th grade, K-8, or K-12.   Classrooms in private schools vary in size however are typically smaller than classrooms found in public school settings.   Independent private schools manage their own budgets, admissions process, and have the independence to create their own curriculum and articulate a unique educational vision and philosophy.   Many private schools provide students with enriched opportunities to explore the sciences, arts, sports, music, community service and a wide array of curricular options.   School tuition varies from $15K to $40K. Needs based scholarships are available at all private schools; a single application and assessment form determines need.     The Application Process     The majority of NYC\u2019s private independent schools are members of ISAAGNY, the Independent Schools Admissions Association of Greater New York , a non-profit organization that establishes a consistent set of admission timelines, practices, and guidelines.   The application process for all private independent schools begins the year before admission is sought, with applications typically available on-line the day after Labor Day.   All schools require a written application, tour or open house, parent and child interviews.   Most of the schools require that student applicants (K-12) be assessed with a standard assessment test offered by the Education Records Bureau (ERB) . Fee reductions for the ERB tests are available through a partnership of the ERB and ISAAGNY.   Some schools will accept an alternate test, the Secondary School Admissions Test (SSAT) for students entering in Grade 5-11. Be sure to check with the schools to which you are applying.   All application materials must be completed as early as November and as late as December. It is important to keep track of all deadlines.   Decisions are typically mailed to families between mid-February and early March. Exact dates are available on the websites of individual schools and ISAAGNY .     Eligibility     The birthday cutoff for placement purposes is August 31 for most private schools. Therefore, a child must be 5 years old on or before August 31 of the year they enroll to be eligible for Kindergarten.   Families seeking admission to a private school admission are strongly encouraged to visit and register their child for public school [link: to come] and participate in the public school choice programs [link: to come], as appropriate or desired.     Determining School Options     ISAAGNY (described above) includes quick links to all of its member schools.   The Parent\u2019s League of New York , a membership organization that works on behalf of NYC private independent schools and parents, offers parent education programs, school fairs, an advisory service, and publications on NYC schools and enrichment offerings.   Early Steps supports families of color who are seeking private school placement for their children seeking enrollment in Kindergarten and First Grade. See the Resource List for organizations that work to identify and support middle and high school students.   Several organizations work to identify and support private school admissions for middle and high school students of color.                         Need Assistance?   The Parents League of New York sponsors school fairs, information sessions for parents, and consultation on school options.

These children often have high maintenance temperaments, characterized by high physical activity, low ability to persist at tasks, and negative reactions to even minor situations.   A new study in the journal Early Childhood Research Quarterly finds that kindergartners and first graders with high maintenance temperaments showed less disruptive behavior and more active engagement and on-task behavior in the classroom, thanks to a program that helps teachers, parents, and students recognize and adapt to individual differences.   Led by researchers at the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, the study builds upon recent findings that the same program generally improves the behavior and academic skills of children and helps shy students be more engaged in their classwork.   \u201cHigh maintenance\u201d is one of four temperaments identified in INSIGHTS into Children\u2019s Temperament , an intervention designed by McClowry to help teachers and parents match environmental demands to a child\u2019s nature. The program provides a framework for appreciating and supporting differences in the personalities of children, rather that trying to change them. Participants in the program learn to recognize four temperaments: shy, social and eager to try, industrious, and high maintenance.   \u201cBy reducing the disruptive behaviors of children with high maintenance temperaments, teachers can create classrooms more conducive to learning \u2013 which benefits both students and teachers,\u201d said Meghan McCormick, a doctoral student in NYU Steinhardt\u2019s psychology and social intervention program and the study\u2019s lead author.   Behavior issues in early elementary school have long-term implications, so early intervention is needed to support children at risk for academic problems,\u201d said\u00a0 Sandee McClowry , the study\u2019s senior author and a professor of applied psychology at NYU Steinhardt.In the current study, the researchers evaluated whether INSIGHTS supports the behavior and academic skills of children in urban, low-income schools, and whether the relationship between teachers and their students made an impact. Prior research demonstrates that, regardless of a child\u2019s temperament, a warm and supportive teacher-child relationship in early elementary school is associated with fewer problem behaviors and greater classroom engagement.   Participants included 435 kindergartners and first graders and their parents across 22 elementary schools. Half of the schools were randomized to use INSIGHTS , while the other half, which served as the control group, participated in a supplemental after-school reading program.   Over 10 weeks, teachers and parents in the INSIGHTS program learned how to recognize differences in children and support them in ways that are specific to their individual temperaments. During the same time period, children participated in INSIGHTS classroom activities, using puppets, flashcards, workbooks, and videotapes to help them solve daily dilemmas and understand how individuals differ in their reactions to life events.   The researchers observed moderate improvements among children with high maintenance temperaments who participated in INSIGHTS , including reductions in disruptive behaviors and off-task behaviors, as well as increases in behavioral engagement.   \u201cGiven the links between behavioral engagement in early schooling and positive academic development, our findings are promising for helping children with high maintenance temperaments succeed academically,\u201d said McClowry.   Interestingly, the quality of the relationship between a teacher and child played a critical role in the children\u2019s behaviors. An analysis suggests that the effects of INSIGHTS in reducing disruptive behaviors and off-task behaviors for children with high-maintenance temperaments were partially mediated through improvements in the quality of teacher-child relationships. The researchers did not observe the same effect of the teacher-child relationship on behavioral engagement.   In addition to McCormick and McClowry, study authors include Elise Cappella and Erin O\u2019Connor. The research was supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education (R305B080019 and R305A080512).
