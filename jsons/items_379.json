Taking place in the fall and spring semesters, the expansive great hall of the Duke House, a historic landmark building, provides an impressive setting for displaying seminal contemporary art in the center of the IFA\u2019s academic home and community.     Spring 2015                        \"Untitled\" (Natural History), 1990. \u00a9 The Felix Gonzalez-Torres Foundation. Courtesy of Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York.                     An installation of two artworks by\u00a0 Felix Gonzalez-Torres will be featured this spring as part of the Great Hall Exhibitions series at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. Organized by Katharine J. Wright and Susanna V. Temkin, this installation pairs two works encompassing different media and conceptual practices that speak to major themes in the artist's oeuvre. The manifestable candy piece \"Untitled (Placebo-Landscape-for Roni)\", 1993 and the static photographic work \"Untitled\" (Natural History), 1990 offer a point of access into overarching strategies that the artist employed throughout the course of his career. The two works will be on view daily,\u00a0 1:00 to 4:00 PM , from March 30 - May 1, 2015.

Exhibition Archive      Fall 2014      EXPAND//FOLD//COLLAPSE// Sculptures by Marta Chilindron      November 3, 2014 to December 5, 2014                Embracing the instability of perspective and form, New York artist Marta Chilindron (b. 1951, Buenos Aires) creates manipulable sculptures in transparent and colored acrylics. Adapted from such basic geometric shapes as spheres, cubes, and pyramids, her artworks conceal their identity as complex, kinetic constructions. Constructed from multiple panels connected by hinges, Chilindron\u2019s sculptures are charged with transformative potential that, when activated by the viewer, cause the works to expand//fold//collapse.      An heir to international constructivism, Chilindron's artworks recall the influence of such artists as Naum Gabo, Lygia Clark, and Donald Judd. However, to this tradition Chilindron adds her own investigations based on her interest in the dynamism and mutability of life. Controlled by the viewer yet mediated by their constructed forms, her artworks transform shape, shift from the second to the third dimension, and extend and contract into space. Magnified by the chromatic interplay caused by the effects of light, these changes underlie the core of her artistic practice.      Providing a dramatic contrast to the ornate interior of the Duke House, seven works by the artist will be on view in the lobby and vestibule of the Institute of Fine Arts for the Fall 2014 Great Hall Exhibition. Focusing on Chilindron\u2019s engagement with idealized geometric forms, these works, executed between 2006 and 2014, will show the diversity of the artist\u2019s practice, ranging from table-top objects such as the curvilinear Helix (2011) to her large-scale Cube 48 Orange (2014). This latter work represents Chilindron\u2019s expansion into immersive sculptural environments, and is being shown in New York for the first time since its debut in the Encounters exhibition at Art Basel Hong Kong, held in spring 2014.

Benglis first received international attention in the late 1960s for a series of works in which she poured brightly colored bands of liquid polyurethane foam and pigmented latex directly on the gallery floor. With their unconventional palette and materials and their ambiguous identity between painting and sculpture, these works initiated Benglis&rsquo;s career-long project of questioning and expanding the boundaries of artistic media, materials, and form. Her works&rsquo; radical aesthetic innovation coupled with their overt critique of dominant modes of artistic practice\u2014from modernist painting to minimalist sculpture\u2014suggest alternative ways of seeing and being unburdened from the repressive verities and traditions of the past. This motivating dichotomy of Benglis&rsquo;s art is perhaps most evident in her consistent engagement with the ostensibly antagonistic processes of creative amalgamation and material degradation, figured through the works&rsquo; invocation of melting, dripping, and deformation. This ruin-like aspect of many of Benglis&rsquo;s works reveals currents of classicism and romanticism running through her oeuvre, albeit deeply informed by feminist critiques of historical continuity and expressive individualism. As such the Institute of Fine Arts provides an ideal intellectual and architectural milieu in which to examine the complex interplay between innovation and tradition that motivates a great deal of Benglis&rsquo;s art. On view at the IFA will be four artworks, two of which are seminal &ldquo;pours&rdquo; from the late 1960s.

NYU Steinhardt has partnered with the Great Oaks Foundation to offer this unique program to qualified members of the Great Oaks Tutor Corps Urban Fellowship Program in Newark, New Jersey.    The curriculum immerses aspiring teachers in the English and Language Arts classrooms and integrates theory, practice, and English content into daily teaching and learning experiences. Graduates of the program are eligible for certification in Teaching English for grades 7-12.    Key Features       Work as a middle school tutor while studying to become a certified teacher NYU Steinhardt&rsquo;s Department of Teaching and Learning and the Great Oaks Foundation have created a model program to prepare you to teach English in urban middle and high schools. Through this special partnership, you will have the opportunity to participate in the Great Oaks Charter School Tutor Corps Urban Fellowship Program for one full school year as a tutor in a middle school while also studying, on site, to become a certified teacher. The hundreds of hours of instructional experience you receive as a tutor along with close mentoring and graduate coursework as a teacher resident provide the essential skills you need to become a highly effective classroom teacher.       The Great Oaks Tutor Corps is a one-year, highly selective, full-time service year for recent college graduates. More than 40 recent college graduates serve as Tutor Corps members in the Great Oaks Charter School , a startup middle school on the front lines of education reform, in Newark, New Jersey. Tutors work with individual 6th, 7th, and 8th graders and in small groups to help boys and girls from disadvantaged backgrounds succeed in school. Tutors live together in a local modern apartment building and receive housing, medical insurance, and a modest living allowance. Watch a video about the Great Oaks Charter School and the Tutor Corps. Learn more about the Tutor Corps on Facebook .    The Clinically Based English Education Teacher Residency Program offers Tutor Corps members with qualified academic backgrounds in English, literature, dramatic studies, and related language arts fields an opportunity to become a certified English teacher for grades 7-12. As a Teacher Resident, you will receive close mentoring and participate in graduate coursework to prepare you to become a certified teacher.             Become a certified teacher, then complete your M.A. degree During your year as a Teacher Resident at the Great Oaks Charter School, you will complete 18 credits of graduate coursework and earn your Advanced Certificate degree in Clinically Based English Education (CBEE). This Advanced Certificate makes you eligible for initial certification as an English teacher in New York State, with reciprocity in New Jersey and most other states. To support your first year of studies, the Great Oaks Foundation and NYU Steinhardt provide a full tuition scholarship to each Teacher Resident. In exchange for this tuition support, you must agree to teach for three years in a Newark public or charter school. Upon successful completion of the Advanced Certificate and recommendation by the program director, you may complete the remaining 12 credits toward the Master of Arts degree in Clinically Based English Education during your first year as a new, certified classroom teacher, though you are not required to do so in order to participate in the first year of this program. Obtaining a masters&rsquo; degree is required for professional certification in New York and many other states.          Be immersed in a public school classroom As a Teacher Resident, you will spend 5 days a week from September through June at the Great Oaks Charter School in Newark, New Jersey. You will:       Work closely with your classroom teacher/mentor and the Great Oaks Charter School senior leadership and English faculty    Receive intensive weekly coaching by your classroom mentor and NYU&rsquo;s on-site Urban Master Teacher    Meet together as a small group to discuss classroom experiences, review learner challenges and achievements, and practice teaching skills on Friday afternoons and two Saturdays each month.             Progress from observer to classroom teacher As a Teacher Resident, you will start the school year as an observer and teacher&rsquo;s assistant in one English/Language Arts class. Your training as a teacher&rsquo;s assistant in an important component of the Teacher Residency program and will include co-planning lessons, analyzing student assessment data, and working with small groups of students. Your responsibilities as a teacher's assistant will progress to co-teaching, along with the lead teacher, your class during the school week and then to managing your own classroom during Great Oaks Charter School&rsquo;s Saturday Academy. You will also participate in Saturday Academy. Great Oaks tutors provide select students with additional weekend support to accelerate them to passing levels. Tutors lead one-hour English Language Arts and math classes that focus on strengthening foundational skills, as well as provide 1-on-1 targeted instruction during tutorials. Saturday Academy tutors help further support the Great Oaks mission of student success in college and beyond.          Focus on groups of learners and individual learners As a Teacher Resident, you will work with individual students to understand and address their special learning needs. You will follow closely and tutor a small group of students and take responsibility for improving their individual academic outcomes. Your group will include literacy-challenged students, students with Individualized Education Plans, English language learners, and students from different socioeconomic, racial and ethnic backgrounds.          Explore classrooms and other learning environments You will participate in instructional \"rounds\" led by NYU and school faculty, similar to clinical rounds common in medical education. Rounds will visit a variety of school environments in the Newark area &ndash; district and charter schools &ndash; that will provide a rich context for discussion about the varied needs of urban students.
