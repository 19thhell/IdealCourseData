The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and market performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior.    Economic Development (P, T)   ECON-UA 323 Prerequisites: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10), Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12), and International Economics (ECON-UA 238); or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11) and Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13).

The building blocks of economic theory are used to understand the historical experiences of these countries. Macroeconomic topics covered include economic growth, income distribution, and poverty, with particular emphasis on the concept of underdevelopment as a circular, self-reinforcing trap. Microeconomic topics include the study of particular markets that are especially relevant to developing countries: those for land, labor, and credit. Notions of market fragmentation, limited information, and incentive problems receive emphasis.

The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

After evaluating the criticism directed at public ownership, the course examines an alternative to privatization: reforming state-owned enterprises and public administration, using examples from the United States, Great Britain, and New Zealand. Various issues of privatization (such as the roles of ownership and competition in stimulating efficiency, the implications of separation of ownership from management in distinguishing between private and public enterprises, conditions for successful divestiture programs, privatization's employment impact, and contracting out of government services) are discussed both in principle and via examples from industrial, transitional, and less-developed economies.    Topics in Economic Analysis I (P)   ECON-UA 290 Prerequisite: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Offered every year. 4 points.   A mid-level undergraduate elective course offered to encourage department or visiting faculty who wish to give courses in fields that are not in the permanent course offerings. The exact topic of this course is announced before registration each year. Such \"topics courses\" are not given regularly, and a specific topic presented in any one semester is unlikely to be repeated. Students are allowed to count only one such topics course for the major.    Politics and Finance: Honors Seminar (P)   ECON-UA 296 Identical to POL-UA 396. Prerequisites: Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300), 3.5 GPA, and permission of the Department of Politics. Offered every year. 4 points.

Particular emphasis is placed on the United States. International comparisons are also presented. The course assumes that students have had exposure to microeconomics and finance but not to political theory. A brief introduction to political theory is provided. The approach is similar to that used in microeconomics, except that transactions are made through voting institutions rather than through economic exchange.    Elective Courses: 300 Level    Note: For all courses listed below, Statistics (P) (ECON-UA 18) is a prerequisite for policy electives, and Introduction to Econometrics (T) (ECON-UA 266) is a prerequisite for theory electives.

Designed to familiarize students with a modern approach to industrial organization economics. The modern approach relies extensively on the use of game-theoretic tools to model strategic market behavior and the use of econometric methods for testing hypotheses regarding firm conduct and market performance. In particular, the course analyzes profit-maximizing business strategies of firms with market power, as well as strategic interactions among firms in various types of imperfectly competitive markets. The course addresses both static modes of competition as well as dynamic competition in research and development and product design. The course also examines the scope of effective public policies designed to improve market performance. Throughout the course, mathematical-based models are used to develop the relevant concepts and test the pertinent theories of firm behavior.

Topics covered include, but are not restricted to, prospect theory, mental accounting, other-regarding preferences, and hyperbolic discounting. We usually approach a topic by examining evidence of some departure from the assumptions made in the canonical economic model. We then ask how such departures can be formalized theoretically and how the resulting models can be tested empirically.    Political Economy (T)   ECON-UA 345 Prerequisite: Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.   Introduces the emerging field of formal political economy. The variety of ways in which economists and political scientists think about political science and the interplay of political science and economics are analyzed. The first part of the course focuses on the formal modeling of political behavior and political institutions; the theory of social choice (how groups of rational individuals make decisions) and collective action (how groups of rational individuals take action) are analyzed. The second part of the course discusses the connection between politics and economics and investigates the effect of political variables on the determination of economic outcomes. Some questions that are answered: How can special groups of individuals enhance their well-being by political action? What is lobbying? What is the effect of contributions on political outcomes?

Experimental Economics (P, T)   ECON-UA 360 Prerequisite: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) or Microeconomics (ECON-UA 11). Offered every year. 4 points.    Experimental economics is predicated on the belief that economics, like other sciences, can be a laboratory science where economic theories are tested, rejected, and revised. This course reviews the methodology of doing such laboratory experiments and investigates the use of experiments in a wide variety of fields. These include competitive markets, auctions, public goods theory, labor economics, game theory, and individual choice theory. The course functions as a research seminar in which students present their work as it progresses during the semester. Students also get exposure to the experimental laboratory in the Department of Economics and the research performed there.
