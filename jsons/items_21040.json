Student Health Insurance   The high cost of healthcare in the United States presents a potentially serious financial risk to students. Therefore, NYU requires that all students registered in degree-granting programs maintain health insurance.   Whether enrolled in an NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan or maintaining alternative health insurance coverage, ALL MATRICULATED NYU STUDENTS have access to comprehensive services at the Student Health Center (SHC). Many of the services at the SHC are provided at no cost or very reduced cost to all matriculated students.   Most students are enrolled automatically in one of the NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plans. Students must complete the online enrollment/waiver process each academic year beginning in the fall to ensure that they are enrolled in the plan of their choice; supplement their current insurance with an NYU-sponsored plan, or waive the NYU-sponsored plans.          Student Health Insurance information:                                                                Patient Accounts   For services that are typically covered by insurance plans, NYU SHC will bill the student\u2019s health insurance plan. If the insurance plan does not cover the service or does not pay the entire bill, the student is responsible for the bill.   If you anticipate problems paying your portion of the SHC bill, please contact Patient Accounts at health.patientaccounts@nyu.edu or (212) 443-1010.   Students are billed for unpaid balances on a monthly basis. However, if accounts are not settled in a timely manner, the unpaid balance is transferred to the Bursar\u2019s office to be added to the student\u2019s tuition account.

The NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Program has two components     Mandatory Plan (PDF) - The registration fee included on your tuition bill grants access to services at the Student Health Center as well as limited health insurance coverage for certain hospital emergency room services and mental health outpatient visits.   Optional Plans (PDF) - NYU sponsors three levels of student health insurance plans designed to provide reasonably priced healthcare coverage. The Basic, Comprehensive and GSHIP Plans (PDF) cover the same medical and mental health services. However, they have different:     reimbursement levels   out-of-pocket expenses           All plans offer coverage for services rendered by healthcare providers who participate in the MagnaCare and MultiPlan networks. Referrals are required for services in Manhattan (outside SHC) (see Referrals/Authorizations ). Out-of-network providers are also covered but at a lower reimbursement level. Please note: The NYU Student Health Center (SHC) is in-network under the Student Health Insurance Plans but will be considered out of network under all other plans which utilize the MagnaCare &amp; MultiPlan networks.   Students who are studying abroad with NYU programs are also eligible for the Study Abroad Health Insurance Plan (PDF) designed specifically to allow students easy access to care while outside the United States.

Student Health Insurance   The high cost of healthcare in the United States presents a potentially serious financial risk to students. Therefore, NYU requires that all students registered in degree-granting programs maintain health insurance.   Whether enrolled in an NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan or maintaining alternative health insurance coverage, ALL MATRICULATED NYU STUDENTS have access to comprehensive services at the Student Health Center (SHC). Many of the services at the SHC are provided at no cost or very reduced cost to all matriculated students.   Most students are enrolled automatically in one of the NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Plans. Students must complete the online enrollment/waiver process each academic year beginning in the fall to ensure that they are enrolled in the plan of their choice; supplement their current insurance with an NYU-sponsored plan, or waive the NYU-sponsored plans.          Student Health Insurance information:                                                                Patient Accounts   For services that are typically covered by insurance plans, NYU SHC will bill the student\u2019s health insurance plan. If the insurance plan does not cover the service or does not pay the entire bill, the student is responsible for the bill.   If you anticipate problems paying your portion of the SHC bill, please contact Patient Accounts at health.patientaccounts@nyu.edu or (212) 443-1010.   Students are billed for unpaid balances on a monthly basis. However, if accounts are not settled in a timely manner, the unpaid balance is transferred to the Bursar\u2019s office to be added to the student\u2019s tuition account.

The Sample of Services (PDF) chart gives examples of the types of SHC services that are provided at no cost as well as those services for which there is a fee.     The NYU-sponsored Student Health Insurance Program has two components     Mandatory Plan (PDF) - The registration fee included on your tuition bill grants access to services at the Student Health Center as well as limited health insurance coverage for certain hospital emergency room services and mental health outpatient visits.   Optional Plans (PDF) - NYU sponsors three levels of student health insurance plans designed to provide reasonably priced healthcare coverage. The Basic, Comprehensive and GSHIP Plans (PDF) cover the same medical and mental health services. However, they have different:     reimbursement levels   out-of-pocket expenses           All plans offer coverage for services rendered by healthcare providers who participate in the MagnaCare and MultiPlan networks. Referrals are required for services in Manhattan (outside SHC) (see Referrals/Authorizations ). Out-of-network providers are also covered but at a lower reimbursement level. Please note: The NYU Student Health Center (SHC) is in-network under the Student Health Insurance Plans but will be considered out of network under all other plans which utilize the MagnaCare &amp; MultiPlan networks.   Students who are studying abroad with NYU programs are also eligible for the Study Abroad Health Insurance Plan (PDF) designed specifically to allow students easy access to care while outside the United States.
