There are a variety of social programs, groups and clubs looking for students eager to develop leadership skills by taking primary roles in their organizations.   Peer leaders call on their experience and training to provide guidance to fellow students and members of the community. Members of the student government cultivate the kinds decision making and cooperation skills required to be sought after future leaders. Student leaders organize community outreach projects, plan fundraisers and events, recruit team members and supervise a wide range of programs. Whether it's assuming a primary role in a club or heading a service initiative, there are many opportunities at NYU for students who want to become leaders.
