In the murderous 20th century that experienced two world wars, the Holocaust, and the threat of atomic annihilation, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a rare moment of happiness.

(enter the Mews from University Place) is free and open to the public. Advance registration is required. If you would like to attend, please send an email to deutscheshaus.rsvp@nyu.edu.      In the murderous 20th century that experienced two world wars, the Holocaust, and the threat of atomic annihilation, the fall of the Berlin Wall was a rare moment of happiness. In hindsight, November 9, 1989 and October 3, 1990 (the day of German re-unification) merge into a single event. Twenty-five years ago, things were more complicated. Wolf Lepenies will talk about developments in Europe that are closely linked to the process of German re-unification and have their foci in four different countries: These are 1. France or The New North-South Conflict within Europe, 2. Hungary or The Scandal of an Illiberal Democracy, 3. Poland or The Failure of the Weimar Triangle, 4. Ukraine or The Lost Virtue of Ambiguity.     Wolf Lepenies, b. 1941, sociologist by profession, historian by inclination. Former professor of sociology at the Free University of Berlin and Rector of the Wissenschaftskolleg, the German Institute for Advanced Study in Berlin (1986-2001), now Permanent Fellow emeritus. Long term member, School of Social Science, Institute for Advanced Study Princeton (1982-84), Chaire Europ\u00e9enne, Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris (1991-92). Officer of the French Legion of Honor, Peace Prize of the German Book Trade (2006), Foreign Honorary Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Books in English: Between Literature and Science. The Rise of Sociology (1988), Melancholy and Society (1992), The Seduction of Culture in German History (2006).       Twenty-Five Years After the Fall of the Berlin Wall: Reflections on a United Germany in a Troubled Europe is a DAAD-sponsored event.

Subways: A, B, C, D, E, F (West 4th Street) .   The March 25, 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire was the most devastating industrial disaster in New York City\u2019s history. It claimed the lives of 146 garment workers, mostly immigrant women, who either died in the flames or jumped from a fatal height. The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire threw a spotlight on the sweatshop conditions that characterized the clothing industry. It proved to be a pivotal moment in the effort to bring reform to industrial life in New York. Commemorating the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, this exhibit explores a century of struggle by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and progressive and radical reformers to improve working conditions in the clothing shops, culminating with President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.   The exhibit is curated by NYU\u2019s Tamiment Library . For more information, call 212.998.2630.
