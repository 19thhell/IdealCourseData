Description       In this workshop poets focus on the foundations and intricate dynamics of poetry as a writer's process and on Poetry as a two-headed tradition, having an Oral Tradition and a Written Tradition. A brief review covers some of poetry's history including metric and syllabic measures of writing from the Anglo-Saxon to modern free verse. A weekly reading of a poem by each poet in the circle serves as point of departure for discussions of the relationships of craft and expression.
