Summer Study Abroad Programs FAQ  Am I eligible for the Summer International Programs? Our programs are open to undergraduates, graduates, and post-graduates. Some programs have prerequisite course work or equivalent experience, or require permission of the instructor. If you have questions about prerequisites, please contact the Tisch Special Programs office. Students should talk to their departmental advisors to find out how the Summer International Programs would fit into their degree requirements. Transfer students should note that Tisch International Programs fulfill residency requirements. top Will I need to be fluent in another language to attend? No. All courses are taught in English and students with no previous language training are encouraged to apply. top How do I apply? You can apply here ! Please note some programs require a writing sample, an audition and/or an interview. top How will I be contacted regarding the status of my application? The majority of correspondence during the application process is via email. It is advised that you check your email account regularly. Should our office need further information to evaluate your application, we may request information through email. If an interview or audition is necessary, an email will be sent to the account listed on your application. If you are accepted, wait-listed or declined from the program, you will receive an email. Much of our email is sent in bulk so you may need to set up email filters to receive mail from Tisch Special Programs into your Inbox. For questions regarding your application status, please send an email to tisch.special.admissions@nyu.edu . If correspondence by email is not possible for you please notify our office when you apply. top What programs require an audition? Amsterdam applicants The program is open to students with   prior acting training or experience. Acceptance to the program includes an audition/interview, as well as an online application. All auditions take place in New York City. If you cannot attend the audition in person, you will be able to audition via Skype. Click here for Amsterdam audition dates and details .  Florence applicants The Commedia Dell'Arte program in   Florence is suggested for students with some prior acting experience but   is open to students without prior training. Acceptance to the program   is by audition/interview only. All auditions take place in New York   City, but Skype auditions can be arranged. You must go to this website for complete Florence audition instructions . top Do I need to do an interview? You will be contacted via email if an interview is required for your program. top Will I need to make arrangements for my own housing? No. All Tisch International Programs include student housing. You live with other students participating in the program. As accommodation details vary by site, please contact the Tisch Special Programs office for more specific information. top Are there additional forms of financial aid available? Although the Tisch Special Programs Office is not able to provide direct   scholarships, students are encouraged to consult with their home   institution regarding portable financial assistance such as Pell Grants,   Stafford Loans, and PLUS loans. Students may also want to research   independent sources of aid, compiled by such publishers as the   Foundation Center, and/or investigate personal loans through a bank or   credit union of their choice. Consult Petersons Financial Resources for   International Study to find organizations that offer awards. The NYU Office of Global Services International Student Services, Tel: (212) 998-4720, ogs@nyu.edu , offers a resource center and   library with limited information on study abroad scholarships and   grants. Visit the Tisch Special Programs site regarding scholarship and financial aid opportunities for Study Abroad. Matriculated NYU students are generally eligible for the   same financial aid package they would receive for their study in New   York. Students should consult with NYU Financial Aid at (212) 998-4444   regarding their personal situation and possibilities for aid. TSOA   students may also contact Dory Smith-Wilson in the TSOA Student Affairs   Department at (212) 998-1903. top Will I receive a grade report at the end of the semester? NYU students can check their grade report through the Albert system online. Visiting/Special students will not receive a grade report at the end of the semester; to receive one, you must request either an official or unofficial transcript in writing through the Registrar's Office. All academic record requests must be accompanied by a signed   document. You can either mail, fax or email (with attachment) your   signed form/letter:   Fax: (212) 995-4154 Mail: Office of the University Registrar         Academic Records         P.O.

If you are an American citizen, in most cases visas are not required for stays less than 3 months. However, since requirements change frequently, students should contact the appropriate consulate for up-to-date information or NYU Office of Global Services. NYU Office of Global Services International Student Services Outbound Immigration and Mobility Services Tel: (212) 998-4720 Fax: (212) 995-4115 ogs@nyu.edu    You MUST have a valid passport in order to participate in our programs.

The application deadline is March 3, 2014. The Summer Study Abroad Programs are processed on a rolling admissions basis so the earlier you submit your application the better chance for acceptance. If the course is filled then a wait-list will be applied for all our programs. We will accept applications past the deadlines if space is still available. top How much do courses cost? For the summer, TSOA significantly reduces the cost of taking courses for students by offering a lower tuition rate. Additional costs for travel, housing, food, lab fees, etc. vary by program. Please visit the following website for course information and program fees http://specialprograms.tisch.nyu.edu/page/studyabroad.html top If I have a \"N\" number from a previous summer semester, can I list it on my application?

Nighttime at Singapore&#39;s Marina Bay   Singapore is a city, a country, and an island.\u00a0 In many ways it is the center of the Southeast Asian legal community, as many international law firms operating in the region base themselves here.\u00a0Culturally, Singapore boasts a unique blend of Chinese, Indian, and Malay influences.\u00a0The national language is English, although it might be more accurate to say it is Singlish , an interesting local slang that I am still trying to fully grasp. (For beginners, just add &#8220;la&#8221; at the end of a few sentences, and you&#8217;ll get by just fine.)    NUS Law is next to Singapore&#39;s Botanic Gardens   Courses at NUS are known as \u201cmodules,\u201d and as an exchange student I am to fulfill 16 NUS credits in order to receive 12 NYU credits.\u00a0The four four-credit modules in which I am registered are not too different from typical offerings at NYU; I am enrolled in Mergers &amp; Acquisitions, Entertainment Law, International Commercial Arbitration, and Foreign Direct Investment in Asia.\u00a0Nonetheless, my classroom experience has been rather unique in comparison with what I\u2019ve come to know at NYU.   I am the only American in any of my modules   I attend lectures alongside Singaporean undergraduate students, international exchange students, and graduate LL.M. students.\u00a0In keeping with the broad diversity of the class rosters, many of my courses take a comparative approach to legal analysis.\u00a0We review casework from a variety of jurisdictions, including both common law and civil law systems, although the majority of the cases and legislation that we study come from the U.S., the U.K., or Singapore.   As the \u201ctoken American,\u201d I am often called upon to offer an American perspective on whatever discussion may be occurring. Sometimes the questions are strictly academic, such as explaining the U.S. style of footnoting or assisting my baffled classmates in understanding why two corporations would want to perform a reverse triangular merger.   But other questions have been more\u2026 off-the-cuff. For example, during my very first Entertainment Law lecture, which focuses on pop iconography and celebrity, I was called on several times to express my thoughts on various aspects of American culture. The highlights: describing the impact that Tiger Woods\u2019s scandal has had on his image, explaining the significance of spam within American culture, and contemplating what \u201ctalents\u201d have given Paris Hilton her celebrity status.\u00a0You know, classic \u201cSocratic method\u201d-type questions.   Lectures are three hours long    Course materials are distributed into our lockers   Studying at NUS Law is truly testing the limits of my attention span.\u00a0Although three of my four modules meet just once per week, each lecture is a thorough three-hour session.\u00a0My fourth module, dubbed an &#8220;intensive,&#8221; concluded after the first three weeks of the semester, but during that time we met three times per week, three hours each time.\u00a0After enduring a few Hurricane Sandy-lengthened lectures at NYU at the end of last semester, I thought I might be prepared for the adjustment to longer sessions. I was wrong.\u00a0At times I feel as if there\u2019s not enough powdered instant Nescaf\u00e9 in all of Singapore to keep me alert for the duration of each lecture.\u00a0But sleepiness aside, the long classes do allow us to cover a remarkable amount of material, and it is not unusual for professors to address over 100 pages of reading in a single class.   Attendance counts   In every class that I\u2019ve taken so far at NYU, the final grade that I received has been based entirely on my performance on one culminating assessment, whether it was an in-class exam, a take-home exam, or a research paper.\u00a0But at NUS, professors evaluate student performance throughout the duration of each module with various graded research papers, group projects, or simulations.\u00a0Even attendance and classroom participation can contribute to some percentage of a student\u2019s overall grade.\u00a0In an extreme case, my Foreign Direct Investment in Asia module involves a lengthy in-class contract negotiation, and as such attendance and classroom participation comprise 50% of the final grade.   Extracurricular activities     A quick tangent: I remember about a year ago I was sitting through one of the mandatory PILC summer funding info sessions.\u00a0I knew that I wanted to spend my 1L summer working abroad.\u00a0One of the final slides of the PowerPoint presentation that day was a photo of a beach umbrella; the PILC counselor on stage quipped, \u201cYou can go ANYWHERE! Just don&#8217;t go sit on the beach all summer!&#8221; I think he was joking, but in a &#8220;No, really, we&#8217;re giving you this money, please don&#8217;t go sit on the beach&#8221; sort of tone.\u00a0I heeded the advice and spent my summer working in Beijing, where I basked in pollution and smog rather than UV rays.    Escape to the beaches of Bali in under three hours   Studying in Singapore offers the opportunity to pursue a rigorous legal education\u2026 without sacrificing that beach umbrella.\u00a0NUS students can take advantage of short, inexpensive flights to countless destinations across Asia; popular getaways in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines are all easily accessible. \u00a0University-wide holidays such as Chinese New Year, a mid-semester recess week (Singapore\u2019s version of spring break), and an additional reading week at the conclusion of classes offer plenty of opportunities to travel.\u00a0So if you\u2019re looking to spend your free time frolicking around Southeast Asia, then Singapore has that going for it, too&#8230; which is nice.   There\u2019s even a bit of paradise on campus.\u00a0I live in an apartment-style dormitory in the massive residential area of the NUS campus known as University Town .\u00a0A few weeks ago, the school opened a brand new infinity pool for students just across the lawn from my residence hall.\u00a0Even when you\u2019re not traveling, you can still take in the sunshine and gaze out over the sprawling green campus below.\u00a0After you finish reading all of those documents your professor left in your locker, of course.      On-campus infinity pool   My unsolicited advice to any prospective students or 1Ls who may be reading this: go abroad during your time at NYU.\u00a0Although there&#8217;s still a lot that I miss about Manhattan, I am thoroughly enjoying my semester as an exchange student in Singapore.\u00a0The international atmosphere, cultural diversity, and array of local cuisines all present a welcome change of pace.\u00a0At the very least, my time here is helping me through the post-1L malaise that seems to afflict all law students.\u00a0If you&#8217;re even the slightest bit interested in an international career, or if the prospect of three years of law school in the same place just sounds monotonous to you, then consider one of NYU Law&#8217;s many exchange programs or three new study-abroad options .\u00a0Don&#8217;t worry, you can thank me later.
