Using a client-based approach, OPA provides communications support to the schools and units, seeking to re-emphasize NYU\u2019s distinctive characteristics: a leading research university that has historically been and will continue to be \u201cin and of the city\u201d and that has created a global network of academic centers that make it \u201cin and of the world.\u201d     Through both internal and external outlets, the Office of Public Affairs seeks to tell NYU\u2019s stories, showcasing the scholarship and achievements of NYU\u2019s faculty and students, supporting major University events, and advancing the goals of the University.
