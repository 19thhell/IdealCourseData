Gender identity describes the gender with which a person identifies (i.e., whether one uses man, woman, or more individualized terminology to describe oneself). One's gender identity may or may not differ from one's legal sex which is assigned at birth based on biological characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                        Who is eligible to be housed based on gender identity?                                                       Beginning in Fall 2008, all students will have the option to request to be housed based on their gender identity. This option is open to all students, regardless of identity.                                                                                                                                                                         What does \u2018transgender\u2019 mean?                                                       For many in the transgender - or \"trans\" - community, the term transgender encompasses any identities or expressions that differ significantly from the expected societal norms concerning the gender assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I prefer to be housed based on my gender identity?                                                       NYU will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis. Every effort will be made to honor requests to be housed by gender identity, but if this is not possible, legal sex will be used in determining housing placement.                                                                                                                                                                        If I choose to be housed based on my gender identity, how will this weigh on my other housing options?                                                       NYU will make every effort to accommodate both your wish to be assigned housing based on gender identity, as well as your other preferences (i.e. low-cost housing, specific dorm choice, etc.). While all students are encouraged to provide housing preferences, NYU cannot guarantee to any student a specific dorm, room or roommate. All assignments are based upon space availability.                                                                                                                                                                        Will choosing the gender identity option help me to get better housing?                                                       The choice to be housed based on your gender identity is an additional option offered to all new incoming students. Choosing this option does not garner special consideration for specific rooms or locations.                                                                                                                                                                        What is the background of NYU\u2019s transgender housing procedure?                                                       In November 2005, the New York University Senate passed a resolution adding \"gender identity and expression\" to the University's Anti-Harassment Policy. A task force composed of students and staff members from the Division of Student Affairs was created to review and recommend a revised process by which students may request to be assigned to housing by their gender identity, rather than legal sex. Historically, all students received their room and roommate assignments automatically according to their legal sex. In Fall 2007, new students were able to request housing assignments based upon gender identity, rather than legal sex. Starting in Fall 2008, this option will be offered to all students. In accordance with our existing housing assignment process, we will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis.                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get housing based on my gender identity?                                                       If you want to request to be assigned housing based on your gender identity, rather than legal sex, you may indicate that option on the existing housing application. In the housing preference section, click the box Gender Identity, then click the appropriate box indicating Gender Identity Male (GIM) or Gender Identity Female (GIF). You will also have the option to indicate if you have a preferred first name in addition to your legal name as it appears on the application.                                                                                                                                                                        What if a match cannot be made based upon my gender identity preference?                                                       In this rare situation, your assignment status will default to your    legal sex and you will be assigned accordingly. For more information,    please visit the    NYU LGBTQ Student Center in Kimmel Suite 602 or call 212-998-4424.                                                                                                                                                                             If I am a returning undergraduate and indicate a preference to be assigned based on my gender identity on my reapplication (Phase I), how will this effect my lottery card submission (Phase II) and the online room selection process (Phase III)?                                                       Students who indicate on the Phase I reapplication a preference    to be assigned by their gender identity, will only be able to submit    a Phase II lottery card indicating that they would like to be housed with those who share the same gender identity    preference. The same holds true for the Phase III online room selection    process. Your group will be able to select an empty suite, designating    it as your gender identity, or if no empty suites are available you    will only be able to select spaces within suites already designated    with the same gender identity option.                                                                                                                                                                        What if no space is available?                                                       If no space is available at the time of your selection, we will    work with you and your \"group\" to place you over the summer,    or assign you based upon your legal sex.

Gender identity describes the gender with which a person identifies (i.e., whether one uses man, woman, or more individualized terminology to describe oneself). One's gender identity may or may not differ from one's legal sex which is assigned at birth based on biological characteristics.                                                                                                                                                                        Who is eligible to be housed based on gender identity?                                                       Beginning in Fall 2008, all students will have the option to request to be housed based on their gender identity. This option is open to all students, regardless of identity.

For many in the transgender - or \"trans\" - community, the term transgender encompasses any identities or expressions that differ significantly from the expected societal norms concerning the gender assigned at birth.                                                                                                                                                                        What if I prefer to be housed based on my gender identity?                                                       NYU will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis. Every effort will be made to honor requests to be housed by gender identity, but if this is not possible, legal sex will be used in determining housing placement.                                                                                                                                                                        If I choose to be housed based on my gender identity, how will this weigh on my other housing options?                                                       NYU will make every effort to accommodate both your wish to be assigned housing based on gender identity, as well as your other preferences (i.e. low-cost housing, specific dorm choice, etc.). While all students are encouraged to provide housing preferences, NYU cannot guarantee to any student a specific dorm, room or roommate. All assignments are based upon space availability.                                                                                                                                                                        Will choosing the gender identity option help me to get better housing?                                                       The choice to be housed based on your gender identity is an additional option offered to all new incoming students. Choosing this option does not garner special consideration for specific rooms or locations.                                                                                                                                                                        What is the background of NYU\u2019s transgender housing procedure?                                                       In November 2005, the New York University Senate passed a resolution adding \"gender identity and expression\" to the University's Anti-Harassment Policy. A task force composed of students and staff members from the Division of Student Affairs was created to review and recommend a revised process by which students may request to be assigned to housing by their gender identity, rather than legal sex. Historically, all students received their room and roommate assignments automatically according to their legal sex. In Fall 2007, new students were able to request housing assignments based upon gender identity, rather than legal sex. Starting in Fall 2008, this option will be offered to all students. In accordance with our existing housing assignment process, we will seek to place students who select this option in a room or suite with others of the same gender identity who have requested a room assignment on this basis.                                                                                                                                                                        How do I get housing based on my gender identity?                                                       If you want to request to be assigned housing based on your gender identity, rather than legal sex, you may indicate that option on the existing housing application. In the housing preference section, click the box Gender Identity, then click the appropriate box indicating Gender Identity Male (GIM) or Gender Identity Female (GIF). You will also have the option to indicate if you have a preferred first name in addition to your legal name as it appears on the application.                                                                                                                                                                        What if a match cannot be made based upon my gender identity preference?                                                       In this rare situation, your assignment status will default to your    legal sex and you will be assigned accordingly.

If I am a returning undergraduate and indicate a preference to be assigned based on my gender identity on my reapplication (Phase I), how will this effect my lottery card submission (Phase II) and the online room selection process (Phase III)?                                                       Students who indicate on the Phase I reapplication a preference    to be assigned by their gender identity, will only be able to submit    a Phase II lottery card indicating that they would like to be housed with those who share the same gender identity    preference. The same holds true for the Phase III online room selection    process. Your group will be able to select an empty suite, designating    it as your gender identity, or if no empty suites are available you    will only be able to select spaces within suites already designated    with the same gender identity option.                                                                                                                                                                        What if no space is available?                                                       If no space is available at the time of your selection, we will    work with you and your \"group\" to place you over the summer,    or assign you based upon your legal sex.
