This is mainly because of the self-interference from the transmitter to the receiver at the same node. Recent results have shown promising designs showing that self-interference can be cancelled for use in short-range communications achieving higher throughputs. I will describe the work done by researchers at AT&amp;T Labs in collaboration with other universities to achieve two-way communication and achieving higher throughputs. We give novel Physical and MAC layer designs which demonstrate the feasibility in WiFi type domains. Further extensions to cellular infrastructure will also be discussed.   About the Speakers   Vaneet Aggarwal received the B.Tech. degree in 2005 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, and the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in 2007 and 2010, respectively from Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA, all in Electrical Engineering.   He is currently Senior Member of Technical Staff-Research at AT&amp;T Labs-Research, Florham Park, NJ. His research interests are in applications of information and coding theory to wireless systems. Dr. Aggarwal was the recipient of Princeton University&#39;s Porter Ogden Jacobus Honorific Fellowship in 2009 and AT&amp;T Vice President Excellence Award in 2012.
