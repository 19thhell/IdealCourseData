Students have the option to receive introductory music business training or learn about the history and culture of creative entrepreneurs in recorded music. Students are also introduced to the tools and techniques of recording and begin to use the recording studio as their creative laboratory. In the second year, students deepen their understanding of the art and business of creating and selling recorded music. Students have the opportunity to study the \u201cartist,\u201d how musical talent is identified and cultivated, how material is selected and arranged, how a complete album is constructed in the studio and how the audience and artist have historically influenced each other. Upon completion of a second year review, students work closely with their faculty advisor to develop a personalized course of study focusing on their area of interest. During the third and fourth years, students may pursue advanced level study in business, production, history &amp; criticism, or musicianship via courses offered through the department, as well as through the Stern School of Business, Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development, and the College of Arts and Sciences. Also, during their third year, students have the opportunity to study abroad in one of Tisch's study abroad programs, or participate in the department\u2019s required internship program. The \ufb01nal year culminates with the Capstone Project in which students develop a full creative plan to launch themselves as entrepreneurs. Projects have included launching a record label, creating a production company, developing a new media company, and starting an innovative music venue. As is the case with all Tisch programs, professional training is combined with a solid liberal arts education. In addition to the 58 points taken within the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, students are expected to earn a total of 44 general education points in courses offered by Tisch and the College of Arts and Science. Students also complement their study with 26 points in elective courses taken in the areas of their interest.    Internship Opportunites    Students have the opportunity to complete an industry internship at an established, institutional record company such as Universal or Mercury Records; an independent production company such as Epitaph Records; a trade publication such as Billboard or Impact ; a trade broadcast company such as VH1 or MTV; or a music recording association such as the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM), or the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

Courses like our Songwriters Forum, created in 1989, continually re-energize our commitment to providing undergraduate and graduate students with focused offerings in popular songwriting. We develop talent in myriad ways that engage our students with both the art and the industry&mdash;from faculty members like GRAMMY-nominated songwriters Phil Galdston and Barry Eastmond, Eagles&rsquo; co-founder Glenn Frey, acclaimed country and Americana artist Rosanne Cash, and renowned vocalist Janice Pendarvis, to regular interactions with high-level label executives, music publishers, managers, and other notable professionals. In addition, our students receive unique opportunities: Students Tiger Darrow, Peter Wise, and AJ Smith opened for the Eagles at New York City's Beacon Theatre in Fall 2012; alumna Anna Paddock opened for Paul Simon in Spring 2014. Our alumni include legendary film composer Elmer Bernstein, songwriter Cy Coleman, mastering engineer Emily Lazar, and A Great Big World (Ian Axel and Chad Vaccarino), whose hit song \"Say Something\" was performed with Christina Aguilera on NBC's The Voice this past November. Both our undergraduate curriculum as well as our Concentration in Songwriting at the master's level (M.M.) are devoted to helping our students become the best songwriters they can be, in genres, styles, and approaches they define. Our goal is not to try to \"teach\" students how to become hit songwriters (something we don&rsquo;t believe is teachable, anyhow). Rather, we provide access to the wide range of tools employed by composers and lyricists whose work has distinguished them as important practitioners of the art and craft of song. \u2028\u2028The vision and experience of our faculty, like GRAMMY &reg; -nominated songwriter Phil Galdston, Master Teacher in Songwriting and Faculty Songwriter-in-Residence, help students to engage and explore songwriting with breadth, depth, and fierce individuality. The Songwriters Hall of Fame Master Sessions, which we present in collaboration with the Songwriters Hall of Fame , have featured such luminaries as Jimmy Webb, Nile Rodgers, David Byrne, Glenn Frey, Valerie Simpson, Felix Cavaliere, John Sebastian, and the late Hal David. These unique master classes, in tandem with other innovative programs like our FRIDAY@1 interview/Q&amp;A series (see list to the right), provide our students with unparalleled access to the some of the foremost music-makers of our time.    Through our curriculum , our students have the opportunity to study songwriting and related arts in a number of different settings:       Private, one-on-one classes    As part of Songwriters Forum (12-15 students)    In hands-on performance, production, arranging and engineering classes in the studio environment       Our academic and artistic environment includes access to courses in and collaborations with students and faculty in the related areas of Music Business, Music Technology, and Film Scoring. In addition, our students derive the countless advantages of enrollment in an outstanding liberal arts program at one of the world&rsquo;s great universities.\u2028    SONGWRITING: M.M. in Music Theory and Composition    Phil Galdston, NYU Songwriter-in-Residence, peg233@nyu.edu    Dr. Ron Sadoff, Director of Songwriting, ron.sadoff@nyu.edu                                  Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions - 35 W. 4th Street, Suite 1077 -  New York, NY 10012 -  212 998 5424    This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.
