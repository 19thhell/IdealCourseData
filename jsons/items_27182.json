This employment must be directly related to your program of study.   CPT is divided into two categories:     Internship: the employment is a mandatory part of a course that you are taking for degree credit. The course may be an elective, but the credit must count toward your degree.     Practicum: this is a non-credit employment or fieldwork experience that your department requires of all degree candidates in your program.  CPT is available only if one of these categories is included in the curriculum of your degree program. Because every program has different academic requirements, not every student at NYU will be able to take advantage of CPT.     Eligibility Criteria   In order to qualify for CPT, you must meet the following criteria     You must have been a full time student for at least one academic year, and you must be in valid F-1 status now. You may engage in CPT before the end of one full academic year only if your graduate program requires all enrolled students to obtain work experience in the first academic year.     You must be making normal progress toward degree completion and be in good academic standing.     Procedure to apply     Download an OGS F-1 Curricular Practical Training Request Form . Complete the top half of the form and have the bottom half completed by your academic advisor, dean, department chair, or program coordinator. Your department must endorse your request for CPT by signing and completing the form; confirming:     That you are a full-time student and your anticipated program completion date.     The internship course name, course number, and the number of credits awarded for the course.     That the course credit will count toward fulfilling your degree requirements.     The beginning and ending dates of your employment (month / date / year), the number of hours per week, the company name, complete address, and your job title.       Drop off your completed OGS F-1 Curricular Practical Training Request Form along with the following documents at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated start date of your internship or practicum during office hours, Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.       A photocopy of your passport biography/photo page     I-94 record     A photocopy of your internship class registration (if applicable)     If your payroll will be processed by an outside organization, provide a letter of explanation from your employer specifying the name and address of the payroll company       If eligible, the OGS will authorize you to engage in CPT by issuing an updated I-20. You may not begin employment until you have received your updated I-20.   Once you receive your authorization for CPT, you must apply for a Social Security number if you don't already have one. You must have a Social Security number before you can be paid.                         Restrictions   CPT is typically done on a part-time (up to 20 hours per week) basis during the school year and on a full-time basis during vacation periods. Exceptions may apply for graduate students depending on the structure of the individual student's curriculum.  You may not begin CPT without prior authorization from the OGS. Retroactive authorization is not possible.     If your program does not have an internship option or fieldwork requirement, you are not eligible for CPT. Please read our instructions on Optional Practical Training (OPT) instead.  Note that if you work over 12 months of full-time CPT, you will forfeit all OPT.

If you want to work off-campus as an F-1 student, one way to do so is to be approved for OPT. And remember, once you are authorized to work, you must first have a Social Security number in order to be paid. Learn more about how to apply for a Social Security number. You cannot begin work on OPT until you receive your approval in the form of an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and it is within the dates listed on your EAD.                Who can apply for OPT   \u2022 You must have been a full time student for at least one academic year.   \u2022 You must currently be in F-1 status.   \u2022 You must be in good academic standing and be making normal progress toward finishing your degree.   \u2022 You must not have used more than 12 months of OPT in the past at your current degree level.   \u2022 You do NOT need to have a job offer in order to apply for OPT.              How long OPT lasts   You can get a maximum of 12 months of OPT for each degree level you complete. If you are studying within certain fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) you may be eligible for an additional 17 months of OPT .              When you can use OPT   You can use your OPT:   \u2022 before you finish your program (this is called Pre-Completion OPT )   \u2022 after you finish your program (this is called Post-Completion OPT )   \u2022 or a combination of the two, as long as the total amount of OPT does not exceed 12 months.              How long it takes to get OPT   You need to plan ahead in order to be able to use OPT. It takes around 3-4 months to get approved for OPT. It takes this long because:   1. You need your academic department to sign off on a request form (1-2 weeks depending on your department).   2. You need the OGS to prepare a new I-20 for you recommending the OPT (up to 2 weeks).   3. You need the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to approve your application (up to 90 days)              How you apply for OPT   If you are applying for OPT that you want to use before you finish your program of study, review the Pre-Completion OPT information.     If you are applying for OPT that you want to use after you finish your program of study, review the Post-Completion OPT information.              OPT and Planning Travel                                 Travel before your program end date is the same as it has been: you must have all documents as listed on our travel and reentering the U.S. page .     If you want to travel after your program end date, you need all the documents as listed on our re-entering the U.S. page after you\u2019ve completed your program .     You can also view this YouTube video to review what documents you need to have with you while traveling on post-completion OPT.

Practical Training                      Curricular Practical Training                      Optional Practical Training                          Applying for Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical Training  Before students can apply for either type of work permission, both of the following requirements must first be met:     Students must have valid F-1 visa status for at least nine months .    Employment must be directly related to the field of study .      Students interested in either type of practical training must attend a mandatory workshop conducted by the Office of Global Services (OGS) before their applications will be processed. Information (dates and times) of these workshops will be emailed to international students by the Academic Affairs and Advising Office.    See the adjacent tabs for the authorization procedures for:     Curricular Practical Training (Summer Internship)    Optional Practical Training (Full-Time Position after Graduation)                Curricular Practical Training (Summer Internship)   For more information about Curricular Practical Training (CPT), please visit NYU's Office of Global Services (OGS) website .    To apply for Curricular Practical Training, you must complete the following procedure:       You must have a job offer in order to apply for Curricular Practical Training.    Once you have obtained a summer internship job offer, you should obtain an offer letter from your employer stating the job title and beginning and ending dates of employment. If the position is part-time, the letter should specify the number of hours required per week.    Attend an OGS workshop on Curricular Practical Training.    Complete the Curricular Practical Training Request Form and NYU Stern OCD Request Form . On the CPT Request Form, section A must completed by the student and section B must be completed by Academic Affairs and Advising. Please be sure to include the company address and zip code.    Bring the CPT Request Form, job offer letter, passport, I-20 and I-94 to the Office of Global Services (OGS), at 561 LaGuardia Place.    At OGS, complete the required INS form (I-538). Authorization may be granted in person or within a few days (maximum of 10 days). International students may not begin legal employment until it has been authorized by the OGS and they have notified the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). While students may request the approval at any time, authorization to work will not begin until after the last day of courses of the Spring term.    Curricular practical training is allowed only during the summer break and only once during the Stern MBA program. This training will not count against the 12 months of optional practical training allowed with the F-1 visa. Any other employment during or after your time at Stern will be counted as pre- or post-completion optional practical training and is subject to separate regulations.                Optional Practical Training (Full-time Position after Graduation)   For more information about Optional Practical Training (OPT), please visit NYU's Office of Global Services (OGS) website .   To apply for Optional Practical Training, you must complete the following procedure:       It is not necessary to have a job offer to apply for (post degree completion) Optional Practical Training.    Attend an OGS workshop on Optional Practical Training.    Once it is within 90 days of your graduation date, complete the Optional Practical Training Request Form and NYU Stern OCD Request Form . On the OPT Request Form, section A must completed by the student and section B must be completed by Academic Affairs and Advising.    Bring both completed request forms, the job offer letter (if you have one), your passport, I-94 and I-20 to the Office of Global Services (OGS), at 561 LaGuardia Place.    At OGS, complete the required governmental and internal request forms. Once the initial application is approved, OGS will issue a recommendation for practical training to the student, along with instructions to mail documents to the INS. Applications to the INS can be sent no earlier than 90 days before your graduation date and no later than 60 days after your graduation date. These deadlines are set by the federal government and are not flexible (applications that are even one day late are denied). Students may not begin legal employment until it has been authorized by the INS. Once practical training has been recommended by the OGS, it may not be rescinded (canceled).

This employment must be directly related to your program of study.   CPT is divided into two categories:     Internship: the employment is a mandatory part of a course that you are taking for degree credit. The course may be an elective, but the credit must count toward your degree.     Practicum: this is a non-credit employment or fieldwork experience that your department requires of all degree candidates in your program.  CPT is available only if one of these categories is included in the curriculum of your degree program. Because every program has different academic requirements, not every student at NYU will be able to take advantage of CPT.     Eligibility Criteria   In order to qualify for CPT, you must meet the following criteria     You must have been a full time student for at least one academic year, and you must be in valid F-1 status now. You may engage in CPT before the end of one full academic year only if your graduate program requires all enrolled students to obtain work experience in the first academic year.     You must be making normal progress toward degree completion and be in good academic standing.     Procedure to apply     Download an OGS F-1 Curricular Practical Training Request Form . Complete the top half of the form and have the bottom half completed by your academic advisor, dean, department chair, or program coordinator. Your department must endorse your request for CPT by signing and completing the form; confirming:     That you are a full-time student and your anticipated program completion date.     The internship course name, course number, and the number of credits awarded for the course.     That the course credit will count toward fulfilling your degree requirements.     The beginning and ending dates of your employment (month / date / year), the number of hours per week, the company name, complete address, and your job title.       Drop off your completed OGS F-1 Curricular Practical Training Request Form along with the following documents at least 10 business days prior to the anticipated start date of your internship or practicum during office hours, Monday-Friday, 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.       A photocopy of your passport biography/photo page     I-94 record     A photocopy of your internship class registration (if applicable)     If your payroll will be processed by an outside organization, provide a letter of explanation from your employer specifying the name and address of the payroll company       If eligible, the OGS will authorize you to engage in CPT by issuing an updated I-20. You may not begin employment until you have received your updated I-20.   Once you receive your authorization for CPT, you must apply for a Social Security number if you don't already have one. You must have a Social Security number before you can be paid.                         Restrictions   CPT is typically done on a part-time (up to 20 hours per week) basis during the school year and on a full-time basis during vacation periods. Exceptions may apply for graduate students depending on the structure of the individual student's curriculum.  You may not begin CPT without prior authorization from the OGS. Retroactive authorization is not possible.     If your program does not have an internship option or fieldwork requirement, you are not eligible for CPT. Please read our instructions on Optional Practical Training (OPT) instead.  Note that if you work over 12 months of full-time CPT, you will forfeit all OPT.

If you want to work off-campus as an F-1 student, one way to do so is to be approved for OPT. And remember, once you are authorized to work, you must first have a Social Security number in order to be paid. Learn more about how to apply for a Social Security number. You cannot begin work on OPT until you receive your approval in the form of an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) and it is within the dates listed on your EAD.                Who can apply for OPT   \u2022 You must have been a full time student for at least one academic year.   \u2022 You must currently be in F-1 status.   \u2022 You must be in good academic standing and be making normal progress toward finishing your degree.   \u2022 You must not have used more than 12 months of OPT in the past at your current degree level.   \u2022 You do NOT need to have a job offer in order to apply for OPT.              How long OPT lasts   You can get a maximum of 12 months of OPT for each degree level you complete. If you are studying within certain fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) you may be eligible for an additional 17 months of OPT .              When you can use OPT   You can use your OPT:   \u2022 before you finish your program (this is called Pre-Completion OPT )   \u2022 after you finish your program (this is called Post-Completion OPT )   \u2022 or a combination of the two, as long as the total amount of OPT does not exceed 12 months.              How long it takes to get OPT   You need to plan ahead in order to be able to use OPT. It takes around 3-4 months to get approved for OPT. It takes this long because:   1. You need your academic department to sign off on a request form (1-2 weeks depending on your department).   2. You need the OGS to prepare a new I-20 for you recommending the OPT (up to 2 weeks).   3. You need the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to approve your application (up to 90 days)              How you apply for OPT   If you are applying for OPT that you want to use before you finish your program of study, review the Pre-Completion OPT information.

Practical Training                      Curricular Practical Training                      Optional Practical Training                          Applying for Curricular Practical Training or Optional Practical Training  Before students can apply for either type of work permission, both of the following requirements must first be met:     Students must have valid F-1 visa status for at least nine months .    Employment must be directly related to the field of study .      Students interested in either type of practical training must attend a mandatory workshop conducted by the Office of Global Services (OGS) before their applications will be processed. Information (dates and times) of these workshops will be emailed to international students by the Academic Affairs and Advising Office.    See the adjacent tabs for the authorization procedures for:     Curricular Practical Training (Summer Internship)    Optional Practical Training (Full-Time Position after Graduation)                Curricular Practical Training (Summer Internship)   For more information about Curricular Practical Training (CPT), please visit NYU's Office of Global Services (OGS) website .    To apply for Curricular Practical Training, you must complete the following procedure:       You must have a job offer in order to apply for Curricular Practical Training.    Once you have obtained a summer internship job offer, you should obtain an offer letter from your employer stating the job title and beginning and ending dates of employment. If the position is part-time, the letter should specify the number of hours required per week.    Attend an OGS workshop on Curricular Practical Training.    Complete the Curricular Practical Training Request Form and NYU Stern OCD Request Form . On the CPT Request Form, section A must completed by the student and section B must be completed by Academic Affairs and Advising. Please be sure to include the company address and zip code.    Bring the CPT Request Form, job offer letter, passport, I-20 and I-94 to the Office of Global Services (OGS), at 561 LaGuardia Place.    At OGS, complete the required INS form (I-538). Authorization may be granted in person or within a few days (maximum of 10 days). International students may not begin legal employment until it has been authorized by the OGS and they have notified the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). While students may request the approval at any time, authorization to work will not begin until after the last day of courses of the Spring term.    Curricular practical training is allowed only during the summer break and only once during the Stern MBA program. This training will not count against the 12 months of optional practical training allowed with the F-1 visa. Any other employment during or after your time at Stern will be counted as pre- or post-completion optional practical training and is subject to separate regulations.                Optional Practical Training (Full-time Position after Graduation)   For more information about Optional Practical Training (OPT), please visit NYU's Office of Global Services (OGS) website .   To apply for Optional Practical Training, you must complete the following procedure:       It is not necessary to have a job offer to apply for (post degree completion) Optional Practical Training.    Attend an OGS workshop on Optional Practical Training.    Once it is within 90 days of your graduation date, complete the Optional Practical Training Request Form and NYU Stern OCD Request Form . On the OPT Request Form, section A must completed by the student and section B must be completed by Academic Affairs and Advising.    Bring both completed request forms, the job offer letter (if you have one), your passport, I-94 and I-20 to the Office of Global Services (OGS), at 561 LaGuardia Place.    At OGS, complete the required governmental and internal request forms. Once the initial application is approved, OGS will issue a recommendation for practical training to the student, along with instructions to mail documents to the INS. Applications to the INS can be sent no earlier than 90 days before your graduation date and no later than 60 days after your graduation date. These deadlines are set by the federal government and are not flexible (applications that are even one day late are denied). Students may not begin legal employment until it has been authorized by the INS. Once practical training has been recommended by the OGS, it may not be rescinded (canceled).
