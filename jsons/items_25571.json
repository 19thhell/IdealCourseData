In their junior and senior years, students focus on completing two of five fields of study and restricted electives . In conjunction with department advisors, students select a sequence of courses that satisfy program and degree requirements while simultaneously exploring their own intellectual and professional objectives. A total of 128 course credits are required to graduate.    * Please note that effective Fall 2014 , students taking an MCC core course must earn a B- or better to use that course toward the major or the minor. (MCC core courses taken before Fall 2014 are exempt from this grade requirement.) If a student receives a grade lower than a B-, that student may retake the course once to improve the grade, but only one retaken course is allowed. Additionally, students may only retake a course once. This means that students receiving below a B- in two or more MCC core courses (even if taken in the same semester) will have to explore with their advisor other options for majoring at NYU.

The program&rsquo;s internationally recognized faculty encourage MCC majors to think deeply and broadly about culture and media using theoretical and historical frameworks. The components of the major include core courses in theory and analysis, and upper-level courses in two of the following fields of study : Global and Transcultural Communication, Images and Screen Studies, Interaction and Social Processes, Persuasion and Politics, Technology and Society .    A majority of MCC students take advantage of study opportunities abroad to cultivate a deeper knowledge of the global and transnational issues associated with the production, circulation, and reception of contemporary media.    See the curriculum and degree requirements for the undergraduate major. Read our Frequently Asked Questions section.    What You'll Learn Upon completion of program requirements, undergraduate majors are expected to be able to:       Demonstrate analytical and critical thinking, formulate pertinent research questions and appropriate methodologies, evaluate and use suitable reference materials and primary and secondary sources    Know and understand the key concepts in the study of media, culture, and communication and have fluency in the core scholarly work in these fields    Undertake close readings of written, aural, audio and visual texts    Utilize global and cosmopolitan approaches in the transnational study of media and culture    Attain facility with project-based and fieldwork data collection, and a range of modes for the presentation of findings       Careers The Media, Culture, and Communication program offers students a theoretical background for entry into a wide range of careers and graduate study. New York University was named the best school for media professionals by LinkedIn, in large part because of the success of MCC graduates. A 2014 survey of recent MCC alumni showed that 95% of responders were either full-time employees or in graduate school. In addition, 73% of responders had accepted offers for full-time employment within the first 3 months after graduating.    Our alumni work for companies and organizations such as Viacom, Buzzfeed, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Simon and Schuster, CBS News, ESPN, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures, The New York Times, Capitol Music Group, the United Nations, the BBC, Nielsen, Conde Nast, among many others. They are enrolled in graduate study at universities across the globe, including Harvard, Columbia, Duke, Brown, Cambridge (UK), McGill (Canada), and Ritsumeikan University (Japan).

In their junior and senior years, students focus on completing two of five fields of study and restricted electives . In conjunction with department advisors, students select a sequence of courses that satisfy program and degree requirements while simultaneously exploring their own intellectual and professional objectives. A total of 128 course credits are required to graduate.    * Please note that effective Fall 2014 , students taking an MCC core course must earn a B- or better to use that course toward the major or the minor. (MCC core courses taken before Fall 2014 are exempt from this grade requirement.) If a student receives a grade lower than a B-, that student may retake the course once to improve the grade, but only one retaken course is allowed. Additionally, students may only retake a course once. This means that students receiving below a B- in two or more MCC core courses (even if taken in the same semester) will have to explore with their advisor other options for majoring at NYU.

These students must complete the new 3-course core by the end of their first semester as a junior. Majors will have to take all three core courses, and minors will take two out of three core courses. (These changes will not affect students who entered MCC prior to Fall 2015. Those students will still complete the old 4-course core that was required when they entered.)

The program&rsquo;s internationally recognized faculty encourage MCC majors to think deeply and broadly about culture and media using theoretical and historical frameworks. The components of the major include core courses in theory and analysis, and upper-level courses in two of the following fields of study : Global and Transcultural Communication, Images and Screen Studies, Interaction and Social Processes, Persuasion and Politics, Technology and Society .    A majority of MCC students take advantage of study opportunities abroad to cultivate a deeper knowledge of the global and transnational issues associated with the production, circulation, and reception of contemporary media.    See the curriculum and degree requirements for the undergraduate major. Read our Frequently Asked Questions section.    What You'll Learn Upon completion of program requirements, undergraduate majors are expected to be able to:       Demonstrate analytical and critical thinking, formulate pertinent research questions and appropriate methodologies, evaluate and use suitable reference materials and primary and secondary sources    Know and understand the key concepts in the study of media, culture, and communication and have fluency in the core scholarly work in these fields    Undertake close readings of written, aural, audio and visual texts    Utilize global and cosmopolitan approaches in the transnational study of media and culture    Attain facility with project-based and fieldwork data collection, and a range of modes for the presentation of findings       Careers The Media, Culture, and Communication program offers students a theoretical background for entry into a wide range of careers and graduate study. New York University was named the best school for media professionals by LinkedIn, in large part because of the success of MCC graduates. A 2014 survey of recent MCC alumni showed that 95% of responders were either full-time employees or in graduate school. In addition, 73% of responders had accepted offers for full-time employment within the first 3 months after graduating.    Our alumni work for companies and organizations such as Viacom, Buzzfeed, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, Simon and Schuster, CBS News, ESPN, NBC Universal, Sony Pictures, The New York Times, Capitol Music Group, the United Nations, the BBC, Nielsen, Conde Nast, among many others. They are enrolled in graduate study at universities across the globe, including Harvard, Columbia, Duke, Brown, Cambridge (UK), McGill (Canada), and Ritsumeikan University (Japan).

The CORE is comprised of four areas of the liberal arts:       Expository Writing    Foreign Language    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    Foundations of Scientific Inquiry       Descriptions of these areas and courses which fulfill the requirements are listed below. Some of these requirements can also be fulfilled through Advanced Placement test scores.    Expository Writing    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two courses in expository writing and pass the Writing Proficiency Examination.    Freshmen students who complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay, with a grade of \"C\" or better are certified as proficient, and are not required to sit for the exam. In addition, students must enroll in and successfully complete ACE-UE 0110, The Advanced College Essay: Education and the Professions.    Students enrolled in the Higher Education Opportunity Programs (HEOP) completing 0005 and 0006 (Prose Writing I and II) with grades of \"C\" or better are deemed proficient.    Transfer students entering the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development must pass the Proficiency Examination administered by the Expository Writing Program. This exam determines whether additional coursework in Expository Writing will be required for proficiency certification and is given during orientation. Transfer students who pass the examination and transfer in two courses in writing composition or the equivalent will not be required to complete additional course work in expository writing.    If the students pass and transfer in only one course, they will be required to complete EXPOS-UA 0001, Writing the Essay. The course, Writing the Essay, is significantly different from most writing courses students have taken at two and four year colleges and provides the foundation for writing in the university.    If the students fail and have received transfer credit for either one or two courses in expository writing or the equivalent, they will be required to complete at least one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013 (Writing Tutorial), or EXPOS-UA 0004 (International Writing Workshop 1) as determined by the Expository Writing Program.    Placement may vary depending on the writing issues present in the examination. Students who achieve a letter grade of \"C\" or above in Writing Tutorial are certified as proficient. Students who do not achieve a \"C\" or above must take the Proficiency Exam.    International Students completing EXPOS-UA 0004/0009 (International Writing Workshop 1/International Writing Workshop 2) will take the proficiency examination at the end of their writing-course sequence. If the students fail, they will be required to complete one expository writing course, EXPOS-UA 0013, Writing Tutorial.    Foreign Languages    Media, Culture, and Communication students must complete two semesters of foreign language. MCC students are not exempt from the foreign language requirement but may satisfy it through AP test scores .    Students who will register for any language with which they have prior experience (studied in high school, college or study abroad programs or who are bilingual or multilingual) are required to take a placement examination to determine which level is appropriate.    Placement exams are offered during the first week of classes as well as once a month throughout the semester. The placement test schedule is available at nyu.edu/cas/placementexams .    Foundations of Contemporary Culture    The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes offered through the CORE plan in the College of Arts and Science or options in Steinhardt's Liberal Arts Core (see course listings below). The four course headings are: Texts and Ideas, Cultures and Contexts, Societies and the Social Sciences, and Expressive Cultures.    Texts and Ideas This requirement can be satisfied through the following courses or AP test scores:       AP American History, European History or World History with a score of 4 or 5       NYUSteinhardt courses that will satisfy the Texts and Ideas requirement:       PHED-UE 10 / LIBAR-UE 501 Learning and the Meaning of Life       All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .    Cultures and Contexts There are NO Advanced Placement test scores that satisfy this requirement. All other options for these courses are offered through CAS's College Core Curriculum .

Foundations of Scientific Inquiry    The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. The three areas are Quantitative Reasoning, Natural Sciences I, and Natural Sciences II. Together, these courses ensure that every student gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through other coursework, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the need of non-science students.
