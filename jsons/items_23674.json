We are concerned with the overall well-being of SSSW doctoral students and with their participation in the social, academic and professional life of the school. We function as a unifying body for all SSSW doctoral cohorts. We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

GSA invites graduate students to bring feedback about the program, suggest events and come to them for direction and assistance. The GSA also plans several events for the student body throughout the academic year, such as student-to-student forums, student faculty meets, informal networking events for social work students, mentoring programs, coffee workshops, end-of-semester celebrations, career panels, and a graduation party.

Activities will include guest speakers from programs currently incorporating animal assisted therapy (AAT), to peer led discussions of current research regarding efficacy of AAT. In addition, we will hold monthly meetings to facilitate networking and information sharing to raise awareness of local and national lectures, events, and conferences, as well as volunteer opportunities.

SAASH seeks to develop an atmosphere of mutual aid and support among members and, at the same time, promote discussion on how our professional values as social workers are often connected to our positive moral and ethical values as non-theists and humanists. SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.

We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.

Within the context of the field placement experience, and aligned practice courses, you will have the opportunity to integrate theory and practice. Because the Silver School of Social Work has developed unique partnerships with over 600 public and nonprofit agencies throughout the tri-state area, our placement sites are varied, of high quality, and offer students a rich learning environment. No school devotes as much effort to matching students with appropriate field learning opportunities.   Field learning will immerse you in the extraordinary range of human and social problems that lead clients to reach out for help. It will provide you the opportunity to develop skills and appreciate the realities of coping with complex problems in the context of specific service-delivery systems.   You will be trained to work with a wide range of populations in diverse practice settings. With an emphasis on training for social work practice that promotes social and economic justice, your field education will advance your learning as a relationship-centered, reflective practitioner, preparing you for work with individuals, groups, families, and communities.   For MSW students, in your first, or professional foundation, year, the primary goal of field learning is to provide a foundation of social work practice skills within a generalist perspective. (See foundation year learning objectives in the MSW Student Manual .)     In the second, or advanced concentration, year, MSW students focus their graduate education on specific aspects of social work within specific practice systems (fields of practice) along with their professional development and growth. The faculty advisor, in the capacity of educational consultant, assists students with the development of educational goals and objectives for the advanced concentration year. (See advanced concentration year learning objectives for in the MSW Student Manual .)     Focused Learning Opportunities   The School continues to expand its range of specialized initiatives for students in their advanced concentration year. Students who select to participate in focused learning opportunities are recommended to take specific courses and required colloquia designed to provide curricular support for specialized placements. The following focused learning opportunities are available to students:     Social Work Practice with Children and Families     Social Work Practice with Adolescents in Schools     Social Work Practice with Substance Abuse and Co-Occurring Disorders     Social Work Practice: Zelda Foster Studies in Palliative and End-of-Life Care     Social Work Practice: Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice for Adults with Severe Mental Illness     Social Work Practice: Macro/Micro Practice in Organizations   Social Work Practice : Integrated Youth Behavioral Health Project   Social Work Practice: Integrated Health Care with Adults       See the Fields of Practice and Focused Learning Opportunities Manual for full descriptions and requirements.

Within the context of the field placement experience, and aligned practice courses, you will have the opportunity to integrate theory and practice. Because the Silver School of Social Work has developed unique partnerships with over 600 public and nonprofit agencies throughout the tri-state area, our placement sites are varied, of high quality, and offer students a rich learning environment. No school devotes as much effort to matching students with appropriate field learning opportunities.   Field learning will immerse you in the extraordinary range of human and social problems that lead clients to reach out for help. It will provide you the opportunity to develop skills and appreciate the realities of coping with complex problems in the context of specific service-delivery systems.   You will be trained to work with a wide range of populations in diverse practice settings. With an emphasis on training for social work practice that promotes social and economic justice, your field education will advance your learning as a relationship-centered, reflective practitioner, preparing you for work with individuals, groups, families, and communities.   For MSW students, in your first, or professional foundation, year, the primary goal of field learning is to provide a foundation of social work practice skills within a generalist perspective. (See foundation year learning objectives in the MSW Student Manual .)     In the second, or advanced concentration, year, MSW students focus their graduate education on specific aspects of social work within specific practice systems (fields of practice) along with their professional development and growth. The faculty advisor, in the capacity of educational consultant, assists students with the development of educational goals and objectives for the advanced concentration year. (See advanced concentration year learning objectives for in the MSW Student Manual .)     Focused Learning Opportunities   The School continues to expand its range of specialized initiatives for students in their advanced concentration year. Students who select to participate in focused learning opportunities are recommended to take specific courses and required colloquia designed to provide curricular support for specialized placements. The following focused learning opportunities are available to students:     Social Work Practice with Children and Families     Social Work Practice with Adolescents in Schools     Social Work Practice with Substance Abuse and Co-Occurring Disorders     Social Work Practice: Zelda Foster Studies in Palliative and End-of-Life Care     Social Work Practice: Evidence-Based Mental Health Practice for Adults with Severe Mental Illness     Social Work Practice: Macro/Micro Practice in Organizations   Social Work Practice : Integrated Youth Behavioral Health Project   Social Work Practice: Integrated Health Care with Adults       See the Fields of Practice and Focused Learning Opportunities Manual for full descriptions and requirements.

We are concerned with the overall well-being of SSSW doctoral students and with their participation in the social, academic and professional life of the school. We function as a unifying body for all SSSW doctoral cohorts. We also collaborate with doctoral students from other academic departments, within and outside of NYU, especially with PhD students at other schools of social work in the region. Towards the accomplishment of these goals, the DSA serves as a liaison among SSSW faculty, university administrators and students.

SAASH is also committed to exploring the ways in which the social, political, and historical foundations of the social work profession were, in many ways, influenced by humanist and non-theistic thinking, and how modern practitioners can revisit and reclaim the secular legacy of social work. Finally, SAASH wishes to promote dialogue between social work students and practitioners who identify as atheist, agnostic, and/or Secular Humanist, those who identify as religious or theist, and those who aren\u2019t sure where they stand, in hopes of enriching the intellectual and academic environment here at Silver.
