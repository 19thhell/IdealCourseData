Whatever it is, I believe very strongly that retention and student success on all our campuses is everybody's business.    For many years, colleges and universities have been active in establishing programs and activities which are designed to address those challenges associated with student retention. These efforts generally fall under the rubric of something called \"first year seminars\": they are institutionally based and they reflect those issues which are individually identified, all of this trying to lead to the magic kingdom of student success. Primarily these programs are intended to assist students, as you know, in strengthening academic skills and in negotiating their academic environment so that they can successfully transition to their second year of college. While research informs us that matriculating successfully through the first year is no guarantee of persistence to completion, many colleges and universities continue to offer first year student programs and seminars anyway. In fact, some 74% of American colleges and universities have designed some sort of first year course, and about 88% of these institutions offer these courses with of academic credit and often a letter grade. Without question, these courses differ in content and form, and they reflect the type, size, mission, and challenge faced by these institutions.    My concentration today is on historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and their efforts to formalize their approaches for addressing the obstacles that they have faced which impede success in the first year college experience. Considering that HBCUs entered onto the higher education playing field at a different timeline and under ambiguous circumstances, their thrust in addressing these issues in a formal way may have been due to many obstacles over these years. These institutions were created to provide educational opportunities for African American students who have been the primary attendees at these 118 public and private institutions since their inception. At this stage in the progress of college access, African Americans have the opportunity now to attend practically any institution, but African Americans continue on a large scale to select HBCUs for their baccalaureate degree.    The success of producing large numbers of graduates notwithstanding, in their early years these universities on a large scale did not have a formal infrastructure to address issues relating to retention and student success. Nonetheless, informal measures taken by faculty and staff served over the years to assist students in all categories needed for them to graduate. To a large measure these students continue to be first generation college students and often have a strong and immediate need for academic advising and mentoring, those factors required for college success. Therefore, it is probably quite safe to conjecture that all institutions of higher learning equate student success to the efficacy of sound basic academic skills, the ability of their students to negotiate the institution's environment, to complete the requirements for their degrees in a timely manner, and to exit into the world with the ability to live a life of good citizenry. The extensions to these basic components of student success vary in importance with the university's defined needs. To date, most HBCUs have developed a formal process for engaging new students as they help them advance to the sophomore level and on to completion of the degree. Allow me to profile the birth, the growing pains, and the ultimate \"success\" of a first year program at Dillard University which I designed and shepherded as Provost: the Jubilee Scholars Program.    Upon my arrival at Dillard University, I was greeted with the following: a strong office of enrollment management with a sophisticated and highly successful recruiting formula; a fast-paced enrollment goal of doubling the enrollment from 1500 to 3000 students; a high first to second year attrition factor; and complaints from faculty about the escalating faculty-student ratio. Having addressed these issues at another HBCU, I built this program to begin in the fall of my first year, and it yielded immediate results. Retention, when I arrived, was somewhere around 47% return from the first to the second year, and the first class of the JSP program quickly changed that factor to 76%. The JSP has several elements: 1) making retention successful and success everybody's business; 2) placing oversight of the program in the Office of the Provost; and 3) hiring recent graduates, we call them Faculty Fellows, who could hold the positions for two years and who would commit to graduate school application. The program included a letter grade course with a textbook that concentrated on study habits, time management, and critical thinking skills, cultural rituals, a requirement to attend chapel, journal logging, and a methodical introduction to graduate and professional schools. Therefore, strongly embedded in our definition of student success was the training of students to commit to a lifelong educational process where their life journey would be measured by a strong set of ethics and values and self-determination.    We extended this program to include second and third year retention efforts which yielded a high four year graduation rate for the first class and a high percentage of seniors gaining multiple acceptances into graduate and professional schools at graduation. Dillard's early participation in the NYU Faculty Resource Network and formalized relationships with other major universities has been a significant factor in this regard. However, among the primary objectives of this student success initiative is preparing our students for the level of academic strength and desire to seek graduate school admission and complete the Ph.D., thereby increasing the pool of historically underrepresented doctorates, particularly in historically underrepresented fields. Indeed, this was one of the early charges made to HBCUs by earlier scholars who were concerned with our mission and our scope. These goals extended and personalized the general definition of academic success for Dillard. I realized that such goals were impossible without providing a formal avenue for academic success at the baccalaureate stage; I also wanted our students to understand the relationship between what they had come to learn at Dillard and the person whom they would become.    So what did we learn? Student success programs can be costly, faculty resistance is imminent, HBCUs can successfully challenge their students to complete a baccalaureate in four years, and institutionalizing specialized programs can be short-lived. Measuring these results, however, becomes a lifelong mission for the University.                 Back to Table of Contents"}]},

Primarily these programs are intended to assist students, as you know, in strengthening academic skills and in negotiating their academic environment so that they can successfully transition to their second year of college. While research informs us that matriculating successfully through the first year is no guarantee of persistence to completion, many colleges and universities continue to offer first year student programs and seminars anyway. In fact, some 74% of American colleges and universities have designed some sort of first year course, and about 88% of these institutions offer these courses with of academic credit and often a letter grade. Without question, these courses differ in content and form, and they reflect the type, size, mission, and challenge faced by these institutions.    My concentration today is on historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and their efforts to formalize their approaches for addressing the obstacles that they have faced which impede success in the first year college experience. Considering that HBCUs entered onto the higher education playing field at a different timeline and under ambiguous circumstances, their thrust in addressing these issues in a formal way may have been due to many obstacles over these years. These institutions were created to provide educational opportunities for African American students who have been the primary attendees at these 118 public and private institutions since their inception. At this stage in the progress of college access, African Americans have the opportunity now to attend practically any institution, but African Americans continue on a large scale to select HBCUs for their baccalaureate degree.    The success of producing large numbers of graduates notwithstanding, in their early years these universities on a large scale did not have a formal infrastructure to address issues relating to retention and student success. Nonetheless, informal measures taken by faculty and staff served over the years to assist students in all categories needed for them to graduate. To a large measure these students continue to be first generation college students and often have a strong and immediate need for academic advising and mentoring, those factors required for college success. Therefore, it is probably quite safe to conjecture that all institutions of higher learning equate student success to the efficacy of sound basic academic skills, the ability of their students to negotiate the institution's environment, to complete the requirements for their degrees in a timely manner, and to exit into the world with the ability to live a life of good citizenry. The extensions to these basic components of student success vary in importance with the university's defined needs. To date, most HBCUs have developed a formal process for engaging new students as they help them advance to the sophomore level and on to completion of the degree. Allow me to profile the birth, the growing pains, and the ultimate \"success\" of a first year program at Dillard University which I designed and shepherded as Provost: the Jubilee Scholars Program.    Upon my arrival at Dillard University, I was greeted with the following: a strong office of enrollment management with a sophisticated and highly successful recruiting formula; a fast-paced enrollment goal of doubling the enrollment from 1500 to 3000 students; a high first to second year attrition factor; and complaints from faculty about the escalating faculty-student ratio. Having addressed these issues at another HBCU, I built this program to begin in the fall of my first year, and it yielded immediate results. Retention, when I arrived, was somewhere around 47% return from the first to the second year, and the first class of the JSP program quickly changed that factor to 76%. The JSP has several elements: 1) making retention successful and success everybody's business; 2) placing oversight of the program in the Office of the Provost; and 3) hiring recent graduates, we call them Faculty Fellows, who could hold the positions for two years and who would commit to graduate school application. The program included a letter grade course with a textbook that concentrated on study habits, time management, and critical thinking skills, cultural rituals, a requirement to attend chapel, journal logging, and a methodical introduction to graduate and professional schools. Therefore, strongly embedded in our definition of student success was the training of students to commit to a lifelong educational process where their life journey would be measured by a strong set of ethics and values and self-determination.    We extended this program to include second and third year retention efforts which yielded a high four year graduation rate for the first class and a high percentage of seniors gaining multiple acceptances into graduate and professional schools at graduation. Dillard's early participation in the NYU Faculty Resource Network and formalized relationships with other major universities has been a significant factor in this regard. However, among the primary objectives of this student success initiative is preparing our students for the level of academic strength and desire to seek graduate school admission and complete the Ph.D., thereby increasing the pool of historically underrepresented doctorates, particularly in historically underrepresented fields. Indeed, this was one of the early charges made to HBCUs by earlier scholars who were concerned with our mission and our scope. These goals extended and personalized the general definition of academic success for Dillard. I realized that such goals were impossible without providing a formal avenue for academic success at the baccalaureate stage; I also wanted our students to understand the relationship between what they had come to learn at Dillard and the person whom they would become.    So what did we learn? Student success programs can be costly, faculty resistance is imminent, HBCUs can successfully challenge their students to complete a baccalaureate in four years, and institutionalizing specialized programs can be short-lived. Measuring these results, however, becomes a lifelong mission for the University.

Introduction   A recent study conducted by UNCF's Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute reported that first generation college students represent a significant portion of those attending HBCUs, come from low-income backgrounds, and tend to be less well prepared academically. The report further states that in spite of the potential negative consequences of these student characteristics, HBCUs in the aggregate succeed in retaining and graduating students at a higher rate than predominantly white institutions (PWIs) (Rowley 2007). Moreover, a growing body of literature asserts that faculty at HBCUs play an important role in their students' success, defined as academic achievement, engagement in educationally purposeful activities, satisfaction, acquisition of desired knowledge, skills and competencies, persistence, attainment of educational objectives, and post college performance. (Kuh 2006) Fries-Brit and Turner (2002) asserted that students at HBCUs attributed their success to encouragement from faculty and staff. Pascarella and Terenzini (1991) provided evidence on the positive impact of faculty interactions with students outside of the classroom. Faculty contribute to student success through social as well as academic supports such as comprehensive student orientation programs, learner-centered courses, advising, and mentorship.    Results from comprehensive baseline studies conducted by the UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's (ICB) Enrollment Management Program (EMP) and the Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that contribute to the research concerning the role of faculty in student success at HBCUs, particularly at UNCF member private HBCUs. Moreover, the UNCF studies provide insight into attitudes, policies and practices in enrollment management and academic affairs that both facilitate and hinder systematic involvement of faculty at private HBCUs in efforts aimed at bolstering student recruitment, retention, satisfaction and persistence to graduation.    The UNCF Institute for Capacity Building studies that inform this paper are: The UNCF Enrollment Management Program Presidents' Survey Report (Myrick-Harris and Richardson 2007), and The Competitive Edge: Enrollment Management Practices at Private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Carey 2007) as well as preliminary findings from the CFEP's UNCF Faculty Engagement Study (Myrick-Harris and Nagle 2008).    Historical Overview   Since their inception during Reconstruction and the Jim Crow era, the mission of HBCUs has been to provide access to higher educational opportunities primarily for African American students generally underrepresented in post-secondary education; a further aim has been to prepare these students for graduate study, careers, and leadership roles in society (Lomax 2007). The faculties of HBCUs always have been central to the fulfillment of this mission. Faculties at both private and public HBCUs traditionally have seen their role as multifaceted; while classroom interactions with students have been the primary point of contact, educators at HBCUs generally have accepted as a given that they will advise, mentor, and counsel students as they attempt to negotiate the dynamic social terrain of college life.   UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's Role in Student Success   The UNCF Institute for Capacity Building (ICB) is a strategic UNCF initiative established in 2006 to support its membership of 39 private HBCUs as they attempt to successfully carry out their mission to educate African American students. There are six program components within ICB: Institutional Advancement; Enrollment Management; Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement; Fiscal and Strategic Technical Assistance; Facilities and Infrastructure Enhancement; and Leadership and Governance.    Complementary Roles of EMP and CFEP   Inevitably, a nexus exists among all of the six programs of the UNCF ICB. However, the connection between the Enrollment Management Program (EMP) and Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) is particularly strong, as the missions of these two programs are most directly concerned with the retention and satisfaction of students. The EMP studies and preliminary findings of the CFEP study reveal that administrators and faculty at UNCF member institutions realize and appreciate the link between engaged, satisfied faculty and engaged, satisfied students. However, the studies also reveal that a large number of these institutions do not have in place systematic programs that facilitate faculty's involvement in student recruitment and retention.   Enrollment Management Program   Hossler and Bean (1990) define enrollment management as an \"organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments.\" Carey (2007) stated that enrollment management provides an umbrella of support and collaboration with Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar, and Student Support Services strategically linked in both reporting structures, and oftentimes, physical proximity. In an effort to better understand how UNCF member institutions recruit, enroll, retain, and graduate students, the UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's Enrollment Management Program conducted a comprehensive baseline assessment. Thirty-six UNCF member institutions participated in the assessments.        Methodology          Conducted Presidential Survey      Site Visits (categories of review: Enrollment Management/Admissions, Retention, Student Affairs, Facilities, and Technology)      Attended departmental meetings      Attended student leadership meetings        EMP Presidential Survey:   This survey of UNCF chief executive officers aimed to discern patterns and differences in the respondents' consideration of a range of related variables that influence student success at their institutions, including interaction with faculty. Thirty-one of the 39 presidents of UNCF member institutions participated in the survey administered in 2006.     Findings    UNCF member institutions recognize the need to better understand who their students are, how to align limited resources, how to engage students inside and outside of the classroom and the role that faculty must play in the retention of students. As relates to the connection between faculty involvement and enrollment management goals, the survey findings revealed the following:    77.4% of UNCF presidents recognize that faculty mentoring is very important to recruitment and retention of students    Eighteen respondents (58.0%) listed the benefits of their institutions' small size as a factor that attract students. Specifically, they listed          Low faculty: student ratio      Small class sizes      Individualized attention           Twenty-two of the 31 respondents (70.9%) listed academic programs as a major selling point for their institutions, especially as related to:          Strong and nationally accredited programs      Highly-qualified renowned faculty            Eighteen respondents (58.0%) listed the benefits of their institutions' social context as strong selling points, especially as related to:          Nurturing, family environment      Caring faculty and staff        EMP Comprehensive Assessment   For the EMP institutional assessment, the 39 UNCF member institutions were divided into four regions; eight consultants were hired and went out in teams of two over two semesters to 36 of the campuses. The consultants conducted two-day site visits at each institution, meeting with representatives from Enrollment, Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Affairs, first and last year students, and in some cases campus presidents, chief academic officers, and other key stakeholders.    The assessments uncovered the diversity of enrollment management models at UNCF member institutions, 47% of the institutions used the traditional model of enrollment management referred to above. Eight percent had moved away from the model and decentralized recruitment and retention efforts, and 14% moved to a committee structure hoping to facilitate cross campus collaborations in their recruitment and retention efforts. Thirty percent have traditional admissions operations that focus on the recruitment and awarding of financial aid to students.    The report also revealed that 69% of the institutions currently have a retention office or designated personnel responsible for overall retention on campus. These retention programs focus on first and second year students, who are at a greater risk of dropping out or stopping out. There is a dearth of enrollment management programs at UNCF member institutions that systematically involve faculty in the conceptualization and implementation of activities to recruit and retain students. However, the EMP assessment revealed that potential exemplars exist:          Allen University's Enrollment Management Task force and ASPIRE (Academic Support Program to Inspire and Reach Excellence)      Claflin University's SOAR (Student Outreach and Academic Retention) Program, which is comprised of TRIO Programs, Gear Up and The Counseling Center      Talladega College's program in which faculty return to campus on nights and weekends to serve as mentors      Virginia Union's CAPSUL Program, an Academic Affairs and Student Leadership model that focuses on students' academic achievement      Wilberforce University's first year seminar that has been expanded to include pre-and post-seminar testing of all incoming students         UNCF Faculty Engagement Study   The Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) of UNCF ICB is conducting a network-wide baseline assessment of the perceptions and experiences of faculty at the 39 UNCF member institutions as they attempt to enhance their abilities to promote student success. This study is being conducted over a one-year period-Spring 2008 through Spring 2009-and is a component of the UNCF/Ford Faculty Enhancement Initiative. The study will provide a baseline for the existence of faculty development programs and the level of institutional support for such programs as well as for faculty engagement with students in and outside the classroom at UNCF member institutions. A major assumption of this study is that to influence student success, faculty must be involved in systematic and ongoing activities to acquire and enhance their own pedagogies, teaching and learning strategies, research, and professional development. (Sorcinelli, et.al 2006)    Methodology          Survey of UNCF Chief Academic Officers (CAOs) [March -April 2008]. Thirty-two of the 39 UNCF CAOs participated (CAOs included provosts, vice presidents for academic affairs, and academic deans)      Pilot Survey of UNCF Faculty (March-April 2008); 59 faculty members representing 32 UNCF Institutions participated      Focus Groups - Administrators (CAO Focus Group, April 2008; Faculty and Students (Fall 2008-Winter 2009 at member institutions)      Network-wide Faculty Development Survey (Winter 2009)           Preliminary Findings   CAO Survey - The majority of the 32 CAOs surveyed strongly agree that there is a direct relationship between faculty development efforts and their institutions' vision (61.3%), mission (71.0%), and strategic plans (64.5%). Moreover, CAOs believe that faculty development efforts will help institutions achieve their strategic plan goals. However, less than a third of CAOs surveyed (32.3%) \"strongly agree\" that their institutions actually make an intentional effort to link faculty development with student recruitment and retention.    Pilot Faculty Development Survey Findings - The 59 faculty respondents to the Pilot Faculty Development Survey represented 32 of the 39 UNCF member institutions. Only 27 of the respondents (45.8%) \"strongly agree\" that faculty development efforts at their institutions are directly related to the institution's strategic plan. Further, only 12 of the faculty respondents (20.3%) were in \"strong agreement\" that their institutions make an intentional effort to link faculty development with student recruitment and retention.    The majority of the 59 faculty respondents to this survey self reported that they engage in innovative, learner-centered teaching and learning strategies in and out of the classroom to promote student success, including:          Internships (96.4%)      Freshman year curriculum (92.9%)      Faculty-Student research projects (89.3%)      Honors programs (78.6%)      Capstone seminars (75.0%)      Service learning programs (71.4%)        Challenges and Barriers to Greater Faculty Involvement   Although the majority of administrators and faculty surveyed so far in the UNCF Faculty Engagement Study see the link between faculty development and student success, only 40% of the institutions designate institutional funds for faculty development operations. Nearly half (46%) of the individuals responsible for faculty development receive no additional compensation and the primary incentive for faculty to participate in activities is special recognition. More specifically, respondents noted that there are limited institutional resources to support faculty/student projects (e.g. research, joint conference presentations), pedagogy/curriculum innovation, and co-curricular activities. Further, faculty surveyed revealed that heavy course loads often prevent them from participating in activities meant to enhance their ability to promote student success.    Recommendations:   Recognizing the importance of institutional leadership buy-in for successful retention efforts Tinto (2005) stated \"too few (institutions) are willingly to commit needed resources' and address the deeper structural issues that ultimately shape student persistence.\" While there are many successful strategies that can be employed to encourage faculty engagement in student success, to date the comprehensive assessments of UNCF member institutions have discovered the following practices as effective student retention strategies:          The creation of a comprehensive retention plan that utilizes the expertise and resources of all stakeholders (faculty, staff and students), identifies academic risk factors, and ensures that each factor is considered in the plan.      The enhancement of program assessment practices and requirement of written evidence of key performance indicators or performance benchmarks to assess institutional progress in retention efforts.      The development of early warning policies and practices with strong faculty buy-in.      Institutional leadership transparency with faculty and staff on retention success and challenges.      The establishment of an institutional retention committee with representation from Enrollment, Academic Affairs, Faculty, and other key stakeholders on campus whose mission is tied to the overall mission of the institution.

From the Executive Director     Throughout the last decade, different parties-from government officials to university faculty members and administrators to parents and students themselves-have been involved in trying to define what is meant by student success. The heavy onset of legislative rulings and recommendations, such as the Spellings Commission, the Higher Education Act, and No Child Left Behind, to name a few, has resulted in continuing debates over issues ranging from the merit of standardized tests to the importance of curriculum design and the role of teaching excellence. Still, we are left to grapple with two tough questions: What is student success? and How do we cultivate it?     In November 2008 faculty members and other representatives of Faculty Resource Network institutions addressed these questions and issues during a national symposium on \"Defining and Promoting Student Success,\" hosted by the University of San Francisco in San Francisco, California.     During the two-day symposium, through keynote presentations, plenary panels, and breakout sessions, attendees were provided with the opportunity to consider a range of issues related to student success, including learning styles and theories of intelligence, student preparation, access to higher education, and teaching effectiveness. Through sharing experiences and information on these and other timely topics, symposium participants shared new and effective practices to helping our students achieve success.     In this sixth issue of our online NETWORK: A Journal of Faculty Development, we present excerpts from a number of the presentations that were delivered during that symposium.     Debra M.

Introduction   A recent study conducted by UNCF's Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute reported that first generation college students represent a significant portion of those attending HBCUs, come from low-income backgrounds, and tend to be less well prepared academically. The report further states that in spite of the potential negative consequences of these student characteristics, HBCUs in the aggregate succeed in retaining and graduating students at a higher rate than predominantly white institutions (PWIs) (Rowley 2007). Moreover, a growing body of literature asserts that faculty at HBCUs play an important role in their students' success, defined as academic achievement, engagement in educationally purposeful activities, satisfaction, acquisition of desired knowledge, skills and competencies, persistence, attainment of educational objectives, and post college performance. (Kuh 2006) Fries-Brit and Turner (2002) asserted that students at HBCUs attributed their success to encouragement from faculty and staff. Pascarella and Terenzini (1991) provided evidence on the positive impact of faculty interactions with students outside of the classroom. Faculty contribute to student success through social as well as academic supports such as comprehensive student orientation programs, learner-centered courses, advising, and mentorship.    Results from comprehensive baseline studies conducted by the UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's (ICB) Enrollment Management Program (EMP) and the Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that contribute to the research concerning the role of faculty in student success at HBCUs, particularly at UNCF member private HBCUs. Moreover, the UNCF studies provide insight into attitudes, policies and practices in enrollment management and academic affairs that both facilitate and hinder systematic involvement of faculty at private HBCUs in efforts aimed at bolstering student recruitment, retention, satisfaction and persistence to graduation.    The UNCF Institute for Capacity Building studies that inform this paper are: The UNCF Enrollment Management Program Presidents' Survey Report (Myrick-Harris and Richardson 2007), and The Competitive Edge: Enrollment Management Practices at Private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Carey 2007) as well as preliminary findings from the CFEP's UNCF Faculty Engagement Study (Myrick-Harris and Nagle 2008).    Historical Overview   Since their inception during Reconstruction and the Jim Crow era, the mission of HBCUs has been to provide access to higher educational opportunities primarily for African American students generally underrepresented in post-secondary education; a further aim has been to prepare these students for graduate study, careers, and leadership roles in society (Lomax 2007). The faculties of HBCUs always have been central to the fulfillment of this mission. Faculties at both private and public HBCUs traditionally have seen their role as multifaceted; while classroom interactions with students have been the primary point of contact, educators at HBCUs generally have accepted as a given that they will advise, mentor, and counsel students as they attempt to negotiate the dynamic social terrain of college life.   UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's Role in Student Success   The UNCF Institute for Capacity Building (ICB) is a strategic UNCF initiative established in 2006 to support its membership of 39 private HBCUs as they attempt to successfully carry out their mission to educate African American students. There are six program components within ICB: Institutional Advancement; Enrollment Management; Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement; Fiscal and Strategic Technical Assistance; Facilities and Infrastructure Enhancement; and Leadership and Governance.    Complementary Roles of EMP and CFEP   Inevitably, a nexus exists among all of the six programs of the UNCF ICB. However, the connection between the Enrollment Management Program (EMP) and Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) is particularly strong, as the missions of these two programs are most directly concerned with the retention and satisfaction of students. The EMP studies and preliminary findings of the CFEP study reveal that administrators and faculty at UNCF member institutions realize and appreciate the link between engaged, satisfied faculty and engaged, satisfied students. However, the studies also reveal that a large number of these institutions do not have in place systematic programs that facilitate faculty's involvement in student recruitment and retention.   Enrollment Management Program   Hossler and Bean (1990) define enrollment management as an \"organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments.\" Carey (2007) stated that enrollment management provides an umbrella of support and collaboration with Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar, and Student Support Services strategically linked in both reporting structures, and oftentimes, physical proximity. In an effort to better understand how UNCF member institutions recruit, enroll, retain, and graduate students, the UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's Enrollment Management Program conducted a comprehensive baseline assessment. Thirty-six UNCF member institutions participated in the assessments.        Methodology          Conducted Presidential Survey      Site Visits (categories of review: Enrollment Management/Admissions, Retention, Student Affairs, Facilities, and Technology)      Attended departmental meetings      Attended student leadership meetings        EMP Presidential Survey:   This survey of UNCF chief executive officers aimed to discern patterns and differences in the respondents' consideration of a range of related variables that influence student success at their institutions, including interaction with faculty. Thirty-one of the 39 presidents of UNCF member institutions participated in the survey administered in 2006.     Findings    UNCF member institutions recognize the need to better understand who their students are, how to align limited resources, how to engage students inside and outside of the classroom and the role that faculty must play in the retention of students. As relates to the connection between faculty involvement and enrollment management goals, the survey findings revealed the following:    77.4% of UNCF presidents recognize that faculty mentoring is very important to recruitment and retention of students    Eighteen respondents (58.0%) listed the benefits of their institutions' small size as a factor that attract students. Specifically, they listed          Low faculty: student ratio      Small class sizes      Individualized attention           Twenty-two of the 31 respondents (70.9%) listed academic programs as a major selling point for their institutions, especially as related to:          Strong and nationally accredited programs      Highly-qualified renowned faculty            Eighteen respondents (58.0%) listed the benefits of their institutions' social context as strong selling points, especially as related to:          Nurturing, family environment      Caring faculty and staff        EMP Comprehensive Assessment   For the EMP institutional assessment, the 39 UNCF member institutions were divided into four regions; eight consultants were hired and went out in teams of two over two semesters to 36 of the campuses. The consultants conducted two-day site visits at each institution, meeting with representatives from Enrollment, Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Affairs, first and last year students, and in some cases campus presidents, chief academic officers, and other key stakeholders.    The assessments uncovered the diversity of enrollment management models at UNCF member institutions, 47% of the institutions used the traditional model of enrollment management referred to above. Eight percent had moved away from the model and decentralized recruitment and retention efforts, and 14% moved to a committee structure hoping to facilitate cross campus collaborations in their recruitment and retention efforts. Thirty percent have traditional admissions operations that focus on the recruitment and awarding of financial aid to students.    The report also revealed that 69% of the institutions currently have a retention office or designated personnel responsible for overall retention on campus. These retention programs focus on first and second year students, who are at a greater risk of dropping out or stopping out. There is a dearth of enrollment management programs at UNCF member institutions that systematically involve faculty in the conceptualization and implementation of activities to recruit and retain students. However, the EMP assessment revealed that potential exemplars exist:          Allen University's Enrollment Management Task force and ASPIRE (Academic Support Program to Inspire and Reach Excellence)      Claflin University's SOAR (Student Outreach and Academic Retention) Program, which is comprised of TRIO Programs, Gear Up and The Counseling Center      Talladega College's program in which faculty return to campus on nights and weekends to serve as mentors      Virginia Union's CAPSUL Program, an Academic Affairs and Student Leadership model that focuses on students' academic achievement      Wilberforce University's first year seminar that has been expanded to include pre-and post-seminar testing of all incoming students         UNCF Faculty Engagement Study   The Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) of UNCF ICB is conducting a network-wide baseline assessment of the perceptions and experiences of faculty at the 39 UNCF member institutions as they attempt to enhance their abilities to promote student success. This study is being conducted over a one-year period-Spring 2008 through Spring 2009-and is a component of the UNCF/Ford Faculty Enhancement Initiative. The study will provide a baseline for the existence of faculty development programs and the level of institutional support for such programs as well as for faculty engagement with students in and outside the classroom at UNCF member institutions. A major assumption of this study is that to influence student success, faculty must be involved in systematic and ongoing activities to acquire and enhance their own pedagogies, teaching and learning strategies, research, and professional development. (Sorcinelli, et.al 2006)    Methodology          Survey of UNCF Chief Academic Officers (CAOs) [March -April 2008]. Thirty-two of the 39 UNCF CAOs participated (CAOs included provosts, vice presidents for academic affairs, and academic deans)      Pilot Survey of UNCF Faculty (March-April 2008); 59 faculty members representing 32 UNCF Institutions participated      Focus Groups - Administrators (CAO Focus Group, April 2008; Faculty and Students (Fall 2008-Winter 2009 at member institutions)      Network-wide Faculty Development Survey (Winter 2009)           Preliminary Findings   CAO Survey - The majority of the 32 CAOs surveyed strongly agree that there is a direct relationship between faculty development efforts and their institutions' vision (61.3%), mission (71.0%), and strategic plans (64.5%). Moreover, CAOs believe that faculty development efforts will help institutions achieve their strategic plan goals. However, less than a third of CAOs surveyed (32.3%) \"strongly agree\" that their institutions actually make an intentional effort to link faculty development with student recruitment and retention.    Pilot Faculty Development Survey Findings - The 59 faculty respondents to the Pilot Faculty Development Survey represented 32 of the 39 UNCF member institutions. Only 27 of the respondents (45.8%) \"strongly agree\" that faculty development efforts at their institutions are directly related to the institution's strategic plan. Further, only 12 of the faculty respondents (20.3%) were in \"strong agreement\" that their institutions make an intentional effort to link faculty development with student recruitment and retention.    The majority of the 59 faculty respondents to this survey self reported that they engage in innovative, learner-centered teaching and learning strategies in and out of the classroom to promote student success, including:          Internships (96.4%)      Freshman year curriculum (92.9%)      Faculty-Student research projects (89.3%)      Honors programs (78.6%)      Capstone seminars (75.0%)      Service learning programs (71.4%)        Challenges and Barriers to Greater Faculty Involvement   Although the majority of administrators and faculty surveyed so far in the UNCF Faculty Engagement Study see the link between faculty development and student success, only 40% of the institutions designate institutional funds for faculty development operations. Nearly half (46%) of the individuals responsible for faculty development receive no additional compensation and the primary incentive for faculty to participate in activities is special recognition. More specifically, respondents noted that there are limited institutional resources to support faculty/student projects (e.g. research, joint conference presentations), pedagogy/curriculum innovation, and co-curricular activities. Further, faculty surveyed revealed that heavy course loads often prevent them from participating in activities meant to enhance their ability to promote student success.    Recommendations:   Recognizing the importance of institutional leadership buy-in for successful retention efforts Tinto (2005) stated \"too few (institutions) are willingly to commit needed resources' and address the deeper structural issues that ultimately shape student persistence.\" While there are many successful strategies that can be employed to encourage faculty engagement in student success, to date the comprehensive assessments of UNCF member institutions have discovered the following practices as effective student retention strategies:          The creation of a comprehensive retention plan that utilizes the expertise and resources of all stakeholders (faculty, staff and students), identifies academic risk factors, and ensures that each factor is considered in the plan.      The enhancement of program assessment practices and requirement of written evidence of key performance indicators or performance benchmarks to assess institutional progress in retention efforts.      The development of early warning policies and practices with strong faculty buy-in.      Institutional leadership transparency with faculty and staff on retention success and challenges.      The establishment of an institutional retention committee with representation from Enrollment, Academic Affairs, Faculty, and other key stakeholders on campus whose mission is tied to the overall mission of the institution.

Introduction   A recent study conducted by UNCF's Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute reported that first generation college students represent a significant portion of those attending HBCUs, come from low-income backgrounds, and tend to be less well prepared academically. The report further states that in spite of the potential negative consequences of these student characteristics, HBCUs in the aggregate succeed in retaining and graduating students at a higher rate than predominantly white institutions (PWIs) (Rowley 2007). Moreover, a growing body of literature asserts that faculty at HBCUs play an important role in their students' success, defined as academic achievement, engagement in educationally purposeful activities, satisfaction, acquisition of desired knowledge, skills and competencies, persistence, attainment of educational objectives, and post college performance. (Kuh 2006) Fries-Brit and Turner (2002) asserted that students at HBCUs attributed their success to encouragement from faculty and staff. Pascarella and Terenzini (1991) provided evidence on the positive impact of faculty interactions with students outside of the classroom. Faculty contribute to student success through social as well as academic supports such as comprehensive student orientation programs, learner-centered courses, advising, and mentorship.    Results from comprehensive baseline studies conducted by the UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's (ICB) Enrollment Management Program (EMP) and the Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that contribute to the research concerning the role of faculty in student success at HBCUs, particularly at UNCF member private HBCUs. Moreover, the UNCF studies provide insight into attitudes, policies and practices in enrollment management and academic affairs that both facilitate and hinder systematic involvement of faculty at private HBCUs in efforts aimed at bolstering student recruitment, retention, satisfaction and persistence to graduation.    The UNCF Institute for Capacity Building studies that inform this paper are: The UNCF Enrollment Management Program Presidents' Survey Report (Myrick-Harris and Richardson 2007), and The Competitive Edge: Enrollment Management Practices at Private Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Carey 2007) as well as preliminary findings from the CFEP's UNCF Faculty Engagement Study (Myrick-Harris and Nagle 2008).    Historical Overview   Since their inception during Reconstruction and the Jim Crow era, the mission of HBCUs has been to provide access to higher educational opportunities primarily for African American students generally underrepresented in post-secondary education; a further aim has been to prepare these students for graduate study, careers, and leadership roles in society (Lomax 2007). The faculties of HBCUs always have been central to the fulfillment of this mission. Faculties at both private and public HBCUs traditionally have seen their role as multifaceted; while classroom interactions with students have been the primary point of contact, educators at HBCUs generally have accepted as a given that they will advise, mentor, and counsel students as they attempt to negotiate the dynamic social terrain of college life.   UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's Role in Student Success   The UNCF Institute for Capacity Building (ICB) is a strategic UNCF initiative established in 2006 to support its membership of 39 private HBCUs as they attempt to successfully carry out their mission to educate African American students. There are six program components within ICB: Institutional Advancement; Enrollment Management; Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement; Fiscal and Strategic Technical Assistance; Facilities and Infrastructure Enhancement; and Leadership and Governance.    Complementary Roles of EMP and CFEP   Inevitably, a nexus exists among all of the six programs of the UNCF ICB. However, the connection between the Enrollment Management Program (EMP) and Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) is particularly strong, as the missions of these two programs are most directly concerned with the retention and satisfaction of students. The EMP studies and preliminary findings of the CFEP study reveal that administrators and faculty at UNCF member institutions realize and appreciate the link between engaged, satisfied faculty and engaged, satisfied students. However, the studies also reveal that a large number of these institutions do not have in place systematic programs that facilitate faculty's involvement in student recruitment and retention.   Enrollment Management Program   Hossler and Bean (1990) define enrollment management as an \"organizational concept and a systematic set of activities designed to enable educational institutions to exert more influence over their student enrollments.\" Carey (2007) stated that enrollment management provides an umbrella of support and collaboration with Admissions, Financial Aid, the Registrar, and Student Support Services strategically linked in both reporting structures, and oftentimes, physical proximity. In an effort to better understand how UNCF member institutions recruit, enroll, retain, and graduate students, the UNCF Institute for Capacity Building's Enrollment Management Program conducted a comprehensive baseline assessment. Thirty-six UNCF member institutions participated in the assessments.        Methodology          Conducted Presidential Survey      Site Visits (categories of review: Enrollment Management/Admissions, Retention, Student Affairs, Facilities, and Technology)      Attended departmental meetings      Attended student leadership meetings        EMP Presidential Survey:   This survey of UNCF chief executive officers aimed to discern patterns and differences in the respondents' consideration of a range of related variables that influence student success at their institutions, including interaction with faculty. Thirty-one of the 39 presidents of UNCF member institutions participated in the survey administered in 2006.     Findings    UNCF member institutions recognize the need to better understand who their students are, how to align limited resources, how to engage students inside and outside of the classroom and the role that faculty must play in the retention of students. As relates to the connection between faculty involvement and enrollment management goals, the survey findings revealed the following:    77.4% of UNCF presidents recognize that faculty mentoring is very important to recruitment and retention of students    Eighteen respondents (58.0%) listed the benefits of their institutions' small size as a factor that attract students. Specifically, they listed          Low faculty: student ratio      Small class sizes      Individualized attention           Twenty-two of the 31 respondents (70.9%) listed academic programs as a major selling point for their institutions, especially as related to:          Strong and nationally accredited programs      Highly-qualified renowned faculty            Eighteen respondents (58.0%) listed the benefits of their institutions' social context as strong selling points, especially as related to:          Nurturing, family environment      Caring faculty and staff        EMP Comprehensive Assessment   For the EMP institutional assessment, the 39 UNCF member institutions were divided into four regions; eight consultants were hired and went out in teams of two over two semesters to 36 of the campuses. The consultants conducted two-day site visits at each institution, meeting with representatives from Enrollment, Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Affairs, first and last year students, and in some cases campus presidents, chief academic officers, and other key stakeholders.    The assessments uncovered the diversity of enrollment management models at UNCF member institutions, 47% of the institutions used the traditional model of enrollment management referred to above. Eight percent had moved away from the model and decentralized recruitment and retention efforts, and 14% moved to a committee structure hoping to facilitate cross campus collaborations in their recruitment and retention efforts. Thirty percent have traditional admissions operations that focus on the recruitment and awarding of financial aid to students.    The report also revealed that 69% of the institutions currently have a retention office or designated personnel responsible for overall retention on campus. These retention programs focus on first and second year students, who are at a greater risk of dropping out or stopping out. There is a dearth of enrollment management programs at UNCF member institutions that systematically involve faculty in the conceptualization and implementation of activities to recruit and retain students. However, the EMP assessment revealed that potential exemplars exist:          Allen University's Enrollment Management Task force and ASPIRE (Academic Support Program to Inspire and Reach Excellence)      Claflin University's SOAR (Student Outreach and Academic Retention) Program, which is comprised of TRIO Programs, Gear Up and The Counseling Center      Talladega College's program in which faculty return to campus on nights and weekends to serve as mentors      Virginia Union's CAPSUL Program, an Academic Affairs and Student Leadership model that focuses on students' academic achievement      Wilberforce University's first year seminar that has been expanded to include pre-and post-seminar testing of all incoming students         UNCF Faculty Engagement Study   The Curriculum and Faculty Enhancement Program (CFEP) of UNCF ICB is conducting a network-wide baseline assessment of the perceptions and experiences of faculty at the 39 UNCF member institutions as they attempt to enhance their abilities to promote student success. This study is being conducted over a one-year period-Spring 2008 through Spring 2009-and is a component of the UNCF/Ford Faculty Enhancement Initiative. The study will provide a baseline for the existence of faculty development programs and the level of institutional support for such programs as well as for faculty engagement with students in and outside the classroom at UNCF member institutions. A major assumption of this study is that to influence student success, faculty must be involved in systematic and ongoing activities to acquire and enhance their own pedagogies, teaching and learning strategies, research, and professional development. (Sorcinelli, et.al 2006)    Methodology          Survey of UNCF Chief Academic Officers (CAOs) [March -April 2008]. Thirty-two of the 39 UNCF CAOs participated (CAOs included provosts, vice presidents for academic affairs, and academic deans)      Pilot Survey of UNCF Faculty (March-April 2008); 59 faculty members representing 32 UNCF Institutions participated      Focus Groups - Administrators (CAO Focus Group, April 2008; Faculty and Students (Fall 2008-Winter 2009 at member institutions)      Network-wide Faculty Development Survey (Winter 2009)           Preliminary Findings   CAO Survey - The majority of the 32 CAOs surveyed strongly agree that there is a direct relationship between faculty development efforts and their institutions' vision (61.3%), mission (71.0%), and strategic plans (64.5%). Moreover, CAOs believe that faculty development efforts will help institutions achieve their strategic plan goals. However, less than a third of CAOs surveyed (32.3%) \"strongly agree\" that their institutions actually make an intentional effort to link faculty development with student recruitment and retention.    Pilot Faculty Development Survey Findings - The 59 faculty respondents to the Pilot Faculty Development Survey represented 32 of the 39 UNCF member institutions. Only 27 of the respondents (45.8%) \"strongly agree\" that faculty development efforts at their institutions are directly related to the institution's strategic plan. Further, only 12 of the faculty respondents (20.3%) were in \"strong agreement\" that their institutions make an intentional effort to link faculty development with student recruitment and retention.    The majority of the 59 faculty respondents to this survey self reported that they engage in innovative, learner-centered teaching and learning strategies in and out of the classroom to promote student success, including:          Internships (96.4%)      Freshman year curriculum (92.9%)      Faculty-Student research projects (89.3%)      Honors programs (78.6%)      Capstone seminars (75.0%)      Service learning programs (71.4%)        Challenges and Barriers to Greater Faculty Involvement   Although the majority of administrators and faculty surveyed so far in the UNCF Faculty Engagement Study see the link between faculty development and student success, only 40% of the institutions designate institutional funds for faculty development operations. Nearly half (46%) of the individuals responsible for faculty development receive no additional compensation and the primary incentive for faculty to participate in activities is special recognition. More specifically, respondents noted that there are limited institutional resources to support faculty/student projects (e.g. research, joint conference presentations), pedagogy/curriculum innovation, and co-curricular activities. Further, faculty surveyed revealed that heavy course loads often prevent them from participating in activities meant to enhance their ability to promote student success.    Recommendations:   Recognizing the importance of institutional leadership buy-in for successful retention efforts Tinto (2005) stated \"too few (institutions) are willingly to commit needed resources' and address the deeper structural issues that ultimately shape student persistence.\" While there are many successful strategies that can be employed to encourage faculty engagement in student success, to date the comprehensive assessments of UNCF member institutions have discovered the following practices as effective student retention strategies:          The creation of a comprehensive retention plan that utilizes the expertise and resources of all stakeholders (faculty, staff and students), identifies academic risk factors, and ensures that each factor is considered in the plan.      The enhancement of program assessment practices and requirement of written evidence of key performance indicators or performance benchmarks to assess institutional progress in retention efforts.      The development of early warning policies and practices with strong faculty buy-in.      Institutional leadership transparency with faculty and staff on retention success and challenges.      The establishment of an institutional retention committee with representation from Enrollment, Academic Affairs, Faculty, and other key stakeholders on campus whose mission is tied to the overall mission of the institution.
