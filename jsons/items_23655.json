phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.

phrases as translational research or implementation science appeared, the forerunner of Information for Practice (IP) was conceived. Beginning in 1993 as a resource for social workers using Gopher space, the thread that was to become the current Information for Practice emerged. This service has constantly evolved over the past 20 years into a unique international resource for social care/social welfare/social work professionals, that focuses on aggregating news and new scholarship for professional practice. IP is a constantly updated, free service.   Try out the variety of IP services and learn more about IP.
