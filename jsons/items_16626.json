Starting from an analysis of social networks, we develop a general theory of platform competition, where the platform may be a network such as Facebook but can also be an operating system such as the iOS, Android, or Windows. We start by asking why Facebook, Tweeter and LinkedIn are successful while, for example, MySpace is unsuccessful. We examine how networks are formed from the perspective/incentives of users, the network (platform) operator, and the applications providers that are complementary to the network. We identify key features of networks including: (i) higher value to users from networks of larger size; (ii) very significant inequalities in market share, profits, and (often) prices; (iii) the extent of incentives for interoperability and interconnection between networks; and (iv) importance  of key network nodes that are central or influential in the creation and stability of networks.        Using the main lessons from social networks, we discuss two-sided markets, where two sides/parties wish to interact, and their interactions must go through an intermediary/platform/network. Examples:      Two sides: advertisers and   readers. Intermediary: periodical, Yellow Pages, Internet search engine.   Two sides: Internet   message sender and receiver. Intermediary: Internet Service Provider(s).   Two sides: consumers and   merchants. Intermediary: payment network (e.g., Visa).   Two sides: gamers and game   designers. Intermediary: game-console manufacturer.      We observe that sometimes both sides pay (game-console manufacturers charge both gamers and game designers), sometimes there is a zero price to one side (Google doesnt charge consumers but charges advertisers) and sometimes one side is subsidized (credit-card companies charge merchants, but often subsidize consumers with cash and bonus points or miles). We explain why charges vary across the types of examples above, and apply it to the current controversial issue the abolition of network neutrality, if telephone and cable companies are allowed to charge originators of content on the Internet.        We will discuss other network platforms of importance including (i) mobile smart phones such as iPhone and Android ones; (ii) audio and video distribution networks; (iii) digital books distribution networks; (iv) the PC operating systems market; and (v) the payments systems networks (credit cards) platforms. We will also discuss in detail the structure of the Internet, the Internet search and advertising markets/platforms and network neutrality.        Requirements : T his course is intended for MBA students who have completed the core Firms and Markets course. Law students may take the course with consent of the instructor. Students are expected to participate in class. There will be an in-class midterm. Instead of a final, students will form groups and each group will write an original paper on a topic relevant to the course, subject to the instructors approval. Student groups are expected to make presentations on their topics two weeks before the end of classes. The papers will be submitted electronically at the last class.

Starting from an analysis of social networks, we develop a general theory of platform competition, where the platform may be a network such as Facebook but can also be an operating system such as the iOS, Android, or Windows. We start by asking why Facebook, Tweeter and LinkedIn are successful while, for example, MySpace is unsuccessful. We examine how networks are formed from the perspective/incentives of users, the network (platform) operator, and the applications providers that are complementary to the network. We identify key features of networks including: (i) higher value to users from networks of larger size; (ii) very significant inequalities in market share, profits, and (often) prices; (iii) the extent of incentives for interoperability and interconnection between networks; and (iv) importance  of key network nodes that are central or influential in the creation and stability of networks.        Using the main lessons from social networks, we discuss two-sided markets, where two sides/parties wish to interact, and their interactions must go through an intermediary/platform/network. Examples:      Two sides: advertisers and   readers. Intermediary: periodical, Yellow Pages, Internet search engine.   Two sides: Internet   message sender and receiver. Intermediary: Internet Service Provider(s).   Two sides: consumers and   merchants. Intermediary: payment network (e.g., Visa).   Two sides: gamers and game   designers. Intermediary: game-console manufacturer.      We observe that sometimes both sides pay (game-console manufacturers charge both gamers and game designers), sometimes there is a zero price to one side (Google doesnt charge consumers but charges advertisers) and sometimes one side is subsidized (credit-card companies charge merchants, but often subsidize consumers with cash and bonus points or miles). We explain why charges vary across the types of examples above, and apply it to the current controversial issue the abolition of network neutrality, if telephone and cable companies are allowed to charge originators of content on the Internet.        We will discuss other network platforms of importance including (i) mobile smart phones such as iPhone and Android ones; (ii) audio and video distribution networks; (iii) digital books distribution networks; (iv) the PC operating systems market; and (v) the payments systems networks (credit cards) platforms. We will also discuss in detail the structure of the Internet, the Internet search and advertising markets/platforms and network neutrality.        Requirements : T his course is intended for MBA students who have completed the core Firms and Markets course. Law students may take the course with consent of the instructor. Students are expected to participate in class. There will be an in-class midterm. Instead of a final, students will form groups and each group will write an original paper on a topic relevant to the course, subject to the instructors approval. Student groups are expected to make presentations on their topics two weeks before the end of classes. The papers will be submitted electronically at the last class.

Given a dataset of points the goal is to preprocess it so that,           given a query point close to some data point, return a data point that           is not too far from the query. If one insists on the space being           subquadratic in the number of points (the most important regime in           practice), the only known technique for tackling ANN until recently was           Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) introduced by Indyk and Motwani in           1998. Since then, LSH has been proved very influential both in theory           and in practice.                     During the talk, I will introduce LSH and state certain fundamental           limitations of it. Then, I will talk about a recent line of work that           overcomes them. That is, I will show first data structures for ANN that           are provably better than the best possible LSH-based ones. In           particular, for the first time, we are able to improve upon           [Indyk-Motwani 1998] for the Hamming distance, and [Andoni-Indyk 2006]           for the Euclidean distance.                     The key technique is *data-dependent hashing*: we tailor the hash family           to a given set of data points; this approach has strong parallels with           the practice of ANN. Our hashing schemes are *optimal* in the class of           data-dependent hashing. The key technical tool is a regularity-type           decomposition: we show how to partition a *worst-case* dataset into           several parts that look *random*.                     The talk is based on a joint work with Alex Andoni (Simons Institute)           that can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01062 .

[+]                                           Abstract: Many machine learning tasks can be posed as structured prediction,          where the goal is to predict a labeling or structured object. For          example, the input may be an image or a sentence, and the output is a          labeling such as an assignment of each pixel in the image to          foreground or background, or the parse tree for the sentence. Despite          marginal and MAP inference for many of these models being NP-hard in          the worst-case, approximate inference algorithms are remarkably          successful and as a result structured prediction is widely used.                     What makes these real-world instances different from worst-case          instances? One key difference is that in all of these applications,          there is an underlying \"ground truth\" which structured prediction is          aiming to find. In this talk, I will introduce a new theoretical          framework for analyzing structured prediction algorithms in terms of          their ability to achieve small Hamming error. We study the          computational and statistical trade-offs that arise in this setting,          and illustrate a setting where polynomial-time algorithms can perform          optimal prediction, despite the corresponding MAP inference task being          NP-hard.

This matches the known lower bound of O(k \\log(N/k)) up to constant factors for any k\\leq N^{1-\\delta}. The algorithm runs in near-linear time, and provides the so-called \\ell_2/\\ell_2 guarantee. Our algorithm extends to higher dimensions, leading to sample complexity of O_d(k\\log N), which is again optimal up to constant factors for any constant d. This is the first sample optimal algorithm for these problems.   Using similar techniques, we also obtain an algorithm with slightly suboptimal sample complexity O(k\\log N (\\log\\log N)^2) and a sub-linear time O(k \\log^{O(1)} N) for any constant d. This generalizes the result of [IKP] to higher dimensions.   We also present preliminary experimental evaluation of our sample-optimal near-linear time algorithm, indicating that the empirical sampling complexity of the algorithm is comparable to that of other recovery methods known in the literature, while providing strong provable guarantees on the recovery quality.

Despite much effort          over the years, not much is known on the largest possible sizes of such families,          and a wide gap remains between the best known constructions and upper bounds.          In this work we derive a new upper bound on the sizes of families that possess this property,          improving a result by Urbanke and Li. To that end, we introduce a soft variation of the          Sauer-Perles-Shelah Lemma, that is then used in conjunction with an information-theoretic           argument for a more general setup.

Each player is a node in a social network and strives to form a good match with a          neighboring player; the player utilities from forming a match are correlated. We consider          the existence, computation, and inefficiency of stable matchings from which no pair of players          wants to deviate. We especially focus on networks where players are embedded in a social context,          and may incorporate friendship relations or altruism into their decisions.                     When the benefits from a match are the same for both players, we show that incorporating the          well-being of other players into their matching decisions significantly decreases the price of          stability, while the price of anarchy remains unaffected. Furthermore, a good stable matching          achieving the price of stability bound always exists and can be reached in polynomial time. We          extend these results to more general matching rewards, when players matched to each other may          receive different utilities from the match. For this more general case, we show that incorporating          social context (i.e., \"caring about your friends\") can make an even larger difference, and greatly          reduce the price of anarchy. Finally, we extend most of our results to network contribution games,          in which players can decide how much effort to contribute to each incident edge, instead of simply          choosing a single node to match with.

Approximate degree has wide-ranging applications in theoretical computer science,          from computational learning theory to communication, query, and circuit complexity. Despite its importance,          our understanding of approximate degree remains somewhat limited, with few general results known.                      The focus of this talk will be on a relatively new method for proving lower bounds on approximate degree:          specifying \\emph{dual polynomials}, which are dual solutions to a certain linear program capturing the          approximate degree of any function. After surveying earlier work on approximate degree, I will describe          how the method of dual polynomials has recently enabled progress on several open problems.

Dimension expanders are a linear-algebraic          variant where we ask for a constant number of linear maps that expand subspaces of a vector space          (instead of subsets of vertices). After their definition 10 years ago by Barak, Impagliazzo, Shpilka          and Wigderson there are now two constructions of constant-degree dimension expanders, both of which          suggest dimension expanders are more complicated than expander graphs.                     In this work, we give a new construction of constant-degree dimension expanders (over large fields)          which is quite simple. It follows from an emerging theory of linear-algebraic pseudorandomness where          the rank of a subspace plays the role of the min-entropy of a random variable. In particular, we use          the recent near-optimal construction of subspace designs by Guruswami and Kopparty (based on Wronskians)          to construct a near optimal \"lossy rank condenser\". This condenser, in addition to a tensoring operation,          yields the desired dimension expanders.

We give algorithms based on the sixth level of the          sum-of-squares hierarchy that work with roughly m = n^3/2 observations, and we complement our result by showing that any          attempt to solve tensor prediction with fewer observations through the sum-of-squares hierarchy would run in moderately          exponential time. In contrast, information theoretically roughly m = n observations suffice.                     This work is part of a broader agenda of studying computational vs. statistical tradeoffs through the sum-of-squares hierarchy.          In particular, for linear inverse problems (such as tensor prediction) the natural sum-of-squares relaxation gives rise to a          sequence of norms. Our approach is to characterize their Rademacher complexity. Moreover, both our upper and lower bounds are          based on connections between this, and the task of strongly refuting random 3-XOR formulas, and the resolution proof system.

At first progress was fast, culminating in Coppersmith and Winograd's O(n^{2.376}) algorithm of 1987.          Recently interest in the area has reawakened due to work of Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams and Le Gall,          who managed to improve the exponent slightly from 2.376 to 2.373.                     Roughly speaking, Coppersmith and Winograd constructed an edifice turning an \"identity\"          (some kind of mathematical object) into a fast matrix multiplication algorithm.          Applying their method on the identity TCW, they obtained an O(n^{2.388}) algorithm.          Applying it to TCW^2 (identities can be squared!), they obtained their O(n^{2.376}) algorithm.          They stopped there since computing was a lot more cumbersome in the 1980s.          Using modern computers, Stothers, Vassilevska-Williams and Le Gall were able to analyze          higher powers of TCW (up to TCW^32), and so reduced the exponent to 2.373.                     Our talk answers the following question:                      What is the limit of this approach?                                 We show that this approach cannot yield an exponent smaller than 2.372.          No prior knowledge will be assumed.
