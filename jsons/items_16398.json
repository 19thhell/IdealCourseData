It has wide use and powerful reach yet remains contested and fluid. What opportunities does the invocation of human rights enable, and what does it constrain? How do we understand the intellectual genealogy of human rights? Is human rights the terrain of resistance\u2014or the new orthodoxy? The Gallatin Human Rights Initiative seeks to catalyze critical reflection and engagement with these and related questions.   The Gallatin Global Fellowship in Human Rights supports selected students with up to $5,000 in funding for extended research or experiential learning projects that focus on these issues.        Students will propose their own summer projects and/or internships in the human rights field. These should be affiliated with human rights organizations that operate from within a human rights framework and have the capacity to host students and incorporate them into the substantive aspects of their human rights work in meaningful ways. The aim of the fellowship is to allow students to contribute to the organization\u2019s work while gaining experience in the human rights field in ways that complement their academic trajectory at NYU.        A Year-Long Program          Fall Semester of Acceptance   Accepted fellows must register for two Spring courses: a 0-credit biweekly seminar focusing on human rights, led by Academic Director Vasuki Nesiah, and a 2-credit independent study with a faculty mentor\u2014either their adviser or another NYU faculty member\u2014in which they will explore some aspect of their intended summer project.    Gallatin students must complete a Gallatin independent study application by December 1. Other NYU students may register through their home schools by December 1 or may use the Gallatin independent study application if necessary.   Spring Semester   Fellows must have at least five meetings of the independent study with their selected faculty mentor. Fellows are also required to attend and participate actively in the 0-credit biweekly seminar.     Summer Term   Fellows must commit 9-12 weeks of full-time work on a summer project with an organization working in the human rights field. This means living on-site for between 9 to 12 weeks. Fellows must write and publish at least four blog posts about their experiences.   Fall Semester   Fellows must present their work to the NYU community at the group\u2019s annual Human Rights Symposium. This will involve a substantial 10- to 12-page paper and/or a panel presentation.   NOTE: All fellows must plan to be in residence in NYU Washington Square during the spring semester following the application deadline, and undergraduate fellows must plan to graduate no earlier than the following January.
