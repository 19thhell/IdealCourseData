Friedman        Expected Date of Graduation: 2016        My research examines the ways that universities are enacting and responding to globalization, such as in efforts to educate students to be global-minded, strategies to compete on the international stage, and modes of (re-)organizing social scientific study of the world. I approach this subject using methods and frameworks from the fields of sociology and comparative education, with an interest in understanding the organizational and cultural dimensions of institutional change. For my dissertation, I am examining the ways in which globalization/internationalization has been enacted among eight case universities drawn from elite and mass tiers in the US and UK, focusing on the cultural meanings that university administrators attribute to these reforms, the rationales they offer in support of and against them, and variation in the institutional changes that have taken place.    Additional areas of research include participation in a long-term project housed at the U.S. Social Science Research Council investigating the way U.S. universities support the production and dissemination of knowledge about the world (titled, &lsquo; Producing Knowledge on World Regions &rsquo;). I also serve as Co-Investigator for a project studying the banal, global iconography of university websites and the digitization of study abroad marketing (with Prof. Cynthia Miller-Idriss, American University). At NYU, I have taught undergraduate courses for Steinhardt&rsquo;s minor in Global and Urban Education Studies, and served as teaching assistant for various courses in the M.A. program in International Education.
