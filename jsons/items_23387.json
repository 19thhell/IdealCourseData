A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).

A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).

A focus on research-informed, direct practice with individuals, groups, and families runs though our entire MSW curriculum.   We also offer emphasis on policy practice for students with community and policy interests, integrated primary and behavioral health care, and global social work practice with opportunities to study abroad. All programs have a strong social justice commitment. Our faculty includes the nation's top scholars who are creating new knowledge for tomorrow's social work practice.   The nationally acclaimed NYU Master of Social Work degree is attainable through three full-time and three part-time programs to meet the needs and interests of our student population. We also offer four dual-degree program options in the areas of child development, global public health, law and management.     MSW assessment findings from the 2009 CSWE EPAS ( PDF ).

The program is unique in providing an integrated and broad spectrum of contemporary theories and practice. These include Cognitive Behavioral theory and practice, Dialectical Behavior Therapy and practice, Trauma, Contemporary psychodynamic and psychoanalytic theories including Object Relations, Self Psychology, Relational Theory and Attachment theory and research and its application to practice. Our mission is unique in utilizing a broad spectrum of evidence based practices and reflecting a commitment to open inquiry and critical analysis through a multicultural perspective. Discussion topics include issues related to subjectivity and intersubjectivity, gender, social class, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual identities and disabilities. We consider the dilemmas frequently presented in current and emerging theoretical and practice issues.

We offer an equally integrated program utilizing contemporary models applicable to the practice issues that present themselves in agencies and in private practice. Clinical issues such as trauma, domestic violence, depression, anxiety and emotional regulation and sexual identities are part of our application of theory to practice. The program is designed to provide practitioners with a palette of choices for treatment interventions, all of which have evidence based underpinnings. All of our faculty are currently in direct practice, scholarship and research.     -Theresa Aiello, PhD, LCSW                                                                                                                                                                                                            Program Requirements                                                                                                   This certificate requires the completion of two semesters (one course per semester) over one year.
