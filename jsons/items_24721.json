[{"detail": [{"content": "Why is Affirmative Action such a Divisive Issue                                               Why is Affirmative Action  such a Divisive Issue?         Affirmative  action is one of the most controversial and divisive issues in America .  Those adverse to it argue that by definition, affirmative action programs are  wholly opposed to the American ideals of personal rights; while those in  support of it feel it is necessary for equality. In order to even begin to  understand the rationale behind affirmative action, it is important to first  define the program's intentions and the premise by which it was founded. Affirmative action proponents propose that  the purpose and logic behind affirmative action is not reverse discrimination  or compensation for years of slavery and oppression. Nor is it government  sanctioned racism, sexism or a rejection of American principles. Instead, it is  argued that the consideration of race or gender, particularly on college  campuses, as one of many deciding factors in admissions processes is an attempt  to create the optimal educational experience for everyone. The implementation  of affirmative action programs on college campuses is said to enhance the  learning environment for all students by allowing for an atmosphere of  diversity, in terms of background and point of view. Most importantly, policies that adjust  admissions processes for minorities attempt to compensate for deeply seeded and  complex social problems. While a system of meritocracy is ideal, it is simply  not practical. In America ,  all are not born on an equal playing field.        The  reasons for such an imbalanced landscape of opportunity are wide and  complicated, ranging from the environments in which many minorities grow up,  varying from family life to educational experience, to household income. The  complex backgrounds of different ethnic groups are integral to understanding why  some feel the need for affirmative action. Yet and still, those opposed to  affirmative action try to separate these ideas. It is dangerously nave and  shortsighted to demarcate race from socio-economic status because the two are  so often intertwined. To grow up white  is to be a part of a family that earns a median income of over $44,000 a year,  but to be born into either a black or Hispanic family means a median family  income of just over $24,000 and $33,000, respectively.  [1]    Furthermore, African American or Hispanic workers, making up 13.8 percent and  11.1 percent of the total labor force, are represented by only 6.5 percent, for  African Americans, and 5 percent, for Hispanics, in the upper management of  corporate America .  Similar statistics on whites show the 69.9 percent of the labor force made up  by Caucasians are represented by 84.5 percent at the executive level.         Another unfortunate statistic,  which highlights the painful racial divide in America , is the percentages of  children, under the age of 18, who live in poverty. According to one study,  10.5 percent of white children live in poverty, while 29 percent of Hispanic  kids and 33 percent of African American youths live below poverty lines.  [2]                 Minorities  fall considerably behind their white counterparts in many categories when it  comes to economic standings, but the implications of such financial disparities  are most evident in the access to superior education whites have compared to  minorities. Mean SAT scores reflect the most fundamental failings of the  public education systems attempt to address the rift between races with whites  and blacks earning marks of 1060 and 857, respectively, a full 200 point  difference.  [3]         In the employment context, not all employers are  required to implement an affirmative action program, generally government  entities and federal contractors.  [4]  In cases where the  employer is required to implement an affirmative action program in employment,  the organization must compare the incumbency of females and minorities performing  specific jobs to the availability of those groups in the recruitment area where  the employer finds its employees. Where the employment incumbency in that job  group is less than 80% of the availability of that group, the organization must  establish an affirmative action goal.  [5]  Thus, when there is a job  opening for that particular job group, the organization must take strides to  recruit qualified members of whatever group is underutilized, minorities or  females. However, once the applicants apply, in theory the organization is  required to select the most qualified candidate and cannot make employment  decisions based on race or sex even where there is an affirmative action goal.    [6]  Critics of corporate  affirmative action programs argue that it can be nearly impossible to determine  in the end whether race or gender was used as a final consideration for  employment resulting again in qualified applicants potentially being  discriminated against solely because of their race or gender.  [7]          Affirmative  action has arguably been more effective in its struggle for gender equality  than it has in ending race disparities; with women comprising more high ranking  positions in corporate settings such as that of business and politics than was  the case just 30 years ago. Yet affirmative action poses a great limitation in  that it fails to recognize the intersections of gender, race, and class. Hence,  while as a gender women have progressed dramatically since much earlier times,  closer analysis reveals that women of color (particularly Blacks and  Hispanics), do not comprise much of this progress. Black women especially are  often overlooked in analyses of the impact or effectiveness of affirmative  action and, even more importantly, in the development of policies and programs  that work against systemic social hierarchies.  [8]    This neglect poses a detriment to affirmative action as it prohibits our  culture from tackling the conflicting ways by which gender, race and class  structure our society.  [9]        Historical        //Also needs more balance with women?           Originally, civil rights programs were  constructed to help African Americans become full citizens of the United States .  This was first written in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 13th  Amendment makes slavery illegal, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection  under the law, and finally the 15th Amendment, &quot;forbids racial  discrimination in access to voting.  [10]    However, these amendments were not enough to actually ensure minorities  equality or the right to vote. The southern states  used a variety of techniques of discrimination including literacy tests,  intimidation, violence, and poll taxes.  [11]    In order to achieve equality in all areas of society more had to be done. In 1986, the Supreme Courts decision in Plessy  v. Ferguson upheld a &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that soon  proved to be anything but equal for minorities. However, in 1954, the Supreme  Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson in the court decision supporting Brown  v. Board of Education , which stated separate could not be equal. This led  to the first instances of Affirmative Action.  [12]     In March 1961, President John F  Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, which established the President  ' s  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Its purpose was to end  discrimination in employment by the government and its contractors. Every  federal contract was required to include the pledge that, &quot;The Contractor  will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because  of race, creed, color, or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative  action, to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated  during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national  origin.&quot;  [13]    This signified the first time the government called for Affirmative Action with  a mission for &quot;equal opportunity in employment.&quot;  [14]        The Civil Rights Act of 1964  restated and broadened the principle of Affirmative Action. Title VI declared  that &quot;No person in the United   States shall, on the ground of race, color  or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  federal financial assistance. However,  within one year President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1965 commencement address  argued that fairness required more than a commitment to impartial treatment. In  his speech he said, &quot;You do not take a person who, for years, has been  hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race  and then say you are free to compete with all the others, and still just  believe that you have been completely fair.&quot; This set the stage for the  contemporary use of affirmative action.  [15]  Several  months later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, requiring all  government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in order  to expand job opportunities for minorities  [16]  ,  and  ,  in   1967, H h e  amended it to include affirmative action for women.  [17]   President Johnsons order was stated in  language very similar to that of President Kennedys; however, Johnson  abolished Kennedys Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and transferred  responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor, authorizing the Secretary to  &quot;adopt such rules and regulation and issue such order as he deems  necessary and appropriate to achieve purposes thereof.&quot;  [18]          It is crucial  to  in   keep in mind that  a  A ffirmative action  is not solely benefiting race differences but gender as well. In preventing  gender discrimination and providing equal opportunities for all sexes, Title IX  has been put in place. Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits  sex discrimination in all education institutions that receive federal funding.  Title IX refers to both employment and admission of students. Violations of  this Title result in withdraw of federal funds or suits by private individuals.  Regulations under Title IX allow affirmative action in instances  cases  in which  members of one sex must be treated differently to overcome the specific effects  of past discrimination.  [19]      At this point in American  history, American law and policy was set against racial discrimination in  workplaces, schoolrooms and public accommodations, as well as in housing and  voting. In recent history, two landmark cases have been Grutter v. Bollinger   and Gratz v. Bollinger . In Grutter v. Bollinger the Supreme Court  under Justice OConnor supported the University of Michigan Law Schools  affirmative action program, specifically endorsing Justice Powells view in  1978s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student  body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in  University admissions.  [20]    The Supreme Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to Bakkes  value as binding precedent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger   upheld the value of student body diversity but decided the use of race in University of Michigan undergraduate schools  affirmative action program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the  universitys asserted interest in diversity. The undergraduate program used a  system that assigned points for certain factors such as geography,  legacy/alumni relationships, and race, while the law school took a more  holistic approach. However, in a  reaction to the Supreme Courts decision in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter  v. Bollinger , University of California Regent Ward Connerly announced his  intention to launch a white initiative to prohibit affirmative action in  education, employment and contracting, which resulted in ending the use of  affirmative action in higher education, public contracting and hiring in  California and Washington State.  [21]          Moral and  Empirical Claims        When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem, as compared their  intended outcomes?        The moral debate tends to center around two major  concepts. The first idea being that  Affirmative Action is reparation for past injustices incurred on American  minorities, and the extent to which reparations are appropriate or  beneficial. For example, the official  position of the American Civil Liberties Union is that affirmative action is a  valuable instrument for leveling what has long been an uneven playing field.  [22]   This The second dominant moral sentiment  argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination where the  inequality is shifted rather than combated, and consequentially violates the  principle of merit that has defined American democracy. The ACLU maintains that affirmative action  merely enables people who might otherwise be shut out, to get their foot in  the door  [23]    and denies that this adversely affects the majority-group applicants. Stanley  Clarke,  Dean of the College   of liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois   at Chicago  summed up  the opposition, when he suggested that  &quot;whites once set  themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges for themselves while  denying them to others. Now, on the  basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves  privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is  no.&quot;   [24]         Empirical claims about  a ffirmative  a ction  generally exist in response to two overarching questions: what is the  underlying cause of the inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action  policies, and what effect have these policies displayed in solving the core  problem. In terms of cause, it is  questioned whether the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of  some innate biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely  social construct. While there is  extensive empirical data, both supporting and refuting the notion of a  race-specific genetic advantage, the controversy that ensues over the  socio-political stigma embedded in the issue often clouds the credibility of  the science involved. The primary  example of such data is the 1994 book The  Bell Curve , which concluded that African Americans have inherently lower  IQs than their white counterparts, and that this discrepancy cannot be  attributed to societal factors. A more  recent study involving Ashkenazi Jews asserts that the  high IQ test  scores of Askenazim, along with their unusual pattern of abilities, are a  product of natural selection, stemming from their occupation of an unusual  social niche.  [25]   Both studies, and their research methods, have  been hotly refuted and defended, leaving them widely inconclusive. The converse  claim attributes the cause of the current racial inequality to prevailing  social policies, attitudes, and racism.    In his 1992 article &quot;Race  and the Schooling of Black Americ  ans,&quot;   Claude Steele makes the argument that the achievement of black students relies  heavily on societal encouragement, and suffers in the face of racism.        The reactionary response to  a ffirmative  action policies seek to measure their  social and economic  efficiency.  . For instance, have the affirmative action  policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the targeted  minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon? A study published in the International Labor Relations Review addressed these issues and  concluded that:         Affirmative Action increases the number of  recruitment and screening practices used by employers, raises employers'  willingness to hire stigmatized applicants, increases the number of minority or  female applicants as well as employees, and increases employers' tendencies to  provide training and formally evaluate employees. When Affirmative Action is  used in recruiting, it generally does not lead to lower credentials or  performance of women and minorities hired.      [26]               A similar 2005 study of affirmative action policies  at three elite universities concluded that  Eliminating affirmative action would significantly  reduce the number of African-Americans and Hispanics admitted to elite  universities, with little gain for White students.  [27]   An opposing study, however, found that  more black and minority police  officers increase crime rates, but this apparently arises because lower hiring  standards involved in recruiting more minority officers reduces the quality of  both new minority and new nonminority officers. The most adverse effects of  these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated areas.  [28]   While limited to racial inequality in a  specified line of work, this data seems conceptually dissents with the position  that Affirmative Action policies are generally beneficial.  When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem?        The moral debate tends to center around the ideas of  justice and entitlement. The first major  question regards whether Affirmative Action is simply reparation for past  injustices incurred on American minorities.    Encompassed within this idea is the supportive idea that such policies  correct for imbedded discrimination within institutions, and enables the  identification of a talented workforce among huge groups of people that have  been historically ignored. The converse  sentiment argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination,  which violates the principle of merit that has defined American democracy.         A more comprehensive moral argument claims that  Affirmative Action misclassifies the recipients of affirmative action in terms  of race, as opposed to a more relevant variable, such as socioeconomic  background. This argument also implies  that such policies fail to address the underlying racism/sexism at the root of  the social imbalance.        Empirical claims about Affirmative Action generally exist  in response to two overarching questions: what is the underlying cause of the  inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem. In terms of cause, it is questioned whether  the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of some innate  biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely social  construct. While various studies have  largely disproved the idea of biological predisposition, the unpopular theory  remains debated, especially with regards to a gender disparity in mathematical  and scientific ability.        Less conclusive studies have been instituted in attempt to  answer questions regarding the social and economic efficiency of affirmative  action policies. For instance, have the affirmative  action policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the  targeted minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon?               Public Opinion               The  issue of affirmative action has not ceased to remain a hot issue with the  public. Opinions vary widely based on  race, gender and economics, and there is no clear consensus on the topic. Overall support for affirmative action  remains slightly above 50% as being considered good for the country, with a  trend leading it from 54% in 1995 to 62% in 2000 and finally 58% in 2001.  [29]   While this support, particularly in 2000, is  not completely split, it does not lead to any decisive stance. Furthermore, different polls, such as one  done by The Washington Post , would show vast differences, such as  approximately 75% opposing affirmative action programs for both minorities and  women.  [30]         When  the issue is divided further there is also fluctuation in support. In 2001, 56% supported affirmative action  programs in regards to college admissions, while 58% supported programs for  minorities and women in regards to job hiring.  [31]   While, this is only a 2% difference, it must  be noted that there is a difference between the two. They are not the same to the public.       Furthermore,  support for programs for women is higher than that for racial minorities. In 2005, 59% were in favor of programs for  women, while only 50% favored those for racial minorities. This is preceded by similar differences in  2003 and 2001.  [32]   Affirmative Action programs for women also  held much higher support when first instituted.    In polls taken in 1995, support shows 85% in favor of having had  programs implemented, while only 49% said they were still needed. However, support has raised to 56% in favor  of programs being needed today when the same poll was administered in 2001.  [33]   This would leave the issue of affirmative  action for women as relatively supported overall; however, a different poll from  1995 showed two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men against programs for  women.  [34]         When  looking at where the different opinions are coming from, there is also a large  variation. Two-thirds of blacks (67%)  but only 36% of whites a 31 percentage-point gap feel that the government  should make every effort to help blacks and other minorities.  Gallup   finds blacks and whites' opinions diverge markedly on questions about policy  preferences and the government's role in addressing racial inequality.  [35]   There is an even greater difference when  looking at a CBS News/N.Y. Times poll, showing 94% of blacks believing  affirmative action programs should be continued, with only 47% of whites  favoring affirmative action. Furthermore,  only 3% of blacks believed programs should be abolished, while 42% of whites  supported abolishing affirmative action programs.  [36]         In  a specific example given of two equally qualified students (one black and one  white) who are applying to the same major university, 47% of Americans said the  students would have an equal chance of being admitted, while 29% said the white  student had a better chance and 20% said the black student. When broken down into what opinions came from  which persons, there is an even more remarkable difference. Fifty percent of non-Hispanic whites said  students have an equal chance, 24% said the black student would have a better  chance, and 21% were in favor of the white student. However, 64% of blacks said the white student  would have a better chance and only 4% said the black student would have a  better chance.  [37]   Regardless, there is a clear consensus that  diversity within colleges is important, 89% of blacks and 78% of whites  favoring it.  [38]         There  is certainly a belief that those who are receiving benefits from affirmative  action are not earning them. A slight  majority (47.6%) believe affirmative action programs are giving preferential  treatment to minorities in school admissions and job hirings even when those  minorities are less qualified than other applicants.  [39]   Preferences stigmatize [minorities] as less  able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they  need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch  away.  [40]   Therefore, while the special treatment may be  helping some, it is leaving a devastating stigma along with the benefits. According to Jeff Jacoby of The Boston  Globe when writing in regards to special awards for minorities only,  Blacks and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome...if only they could be  liberated from the condescending mind-set that thinks it's a compliment to tell  a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  [41]           Finally,  the nation is split into approximate thirds in both 1995 and 2001 when asked if  we should increase, keep the same, or decrease affirmative action programs,  leaving no obvious path for the future of affirmative action in public opinion.  [42]   In political terms, this then leaves a  position on this issue as potentially volatile.    According to David Bositis of the Joint Center   for Political and Economic Studies, Hispanics support affirmative action as  much as blacks do. Even in terms of  suburban whites, [politicians] have to worry...  [43]   Thus, there is a constant risk of alienating  conservatives voters in order to gain minority votes, and as can be seen by the  preceding polls, support varies greatly by both those polling and being polled.      International               Worldwide, policies regarding  race, ethnicity and gender equality in education and employment vary from  strict private-sector quotas that demand minority consideration, to  constitutional laws deeming the same considerations illegal. The most distinctive historically class-based  societies, such as South Africa ,   China and India , have imposed stringent  measures to jumpstart a movement toward equality of minorities.  India , with particularly deep  rooted ethnic barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all  major universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople,  former untouchables and - the latest addition - the Other Backward Classes.  [44]    Although such measures have been met with considerable opposition, the  prevailing opinion is that they are crucial both socially to compensate for  centuries of discrimination, and economically to ensure a continued supply of  business talent within the country. The  success of public sector policies will later dictate the need for similar  quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian Muslim  minority groups.  China s existing quotas for its  Non-Han ethnic minorities in the National Assembly have recently been  supplemented with a temporary exclusion from the 1-child policy for the  Non-Han, which constitute 9% of the population.    Similar quota policies have been exhibited in Macedonia   for their Albanian minority, in Malaysia s  Bumiputra quotas for the Malay Population,    and in Brazil   for Native Brazilians, the poor, and the disabled.         The opposite extreme is seen in  several nations that have actively discouraged or dismissed all racial  preference policies. For example, in  October 2005, Slovakia   passed legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional,  following several unsuccessful years of temporary balancing strategies to  integrate the Slovak Roma population.  [45]    In Japan ,  admission to all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance  exam score, which excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.        In much of the world, however, the national  programs for minority clearly resemble those of the United States . Specific or temporary policies are seen in  many countries, like Greece s  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealand s  University Admissions and scholarship preferences for Maori/Polynesian  minorities, and the United Kingdom s 1998 Good Friday  Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force. Interestingly, some of the most progressive  programs are seen in South   Africa , a country notorious for its history  of violent and convoluted discrimination.    In the Employment Equity Act of 1998  [46]  ,   South Africa   instituted measures to repeal discriminatory laws, promote private-sector  diversity, and investigate the causes and depth of Apartheid-driven and other  inequalities. The act acknowledges  women,  aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, and persons with  disabilities as disadvantaged minority groups, and encourages public and  private sector employers to create and implement realistic plans to increase  diversity over time, while simultaneously assisting in the development of  employee unions and collective bargaining organizations to protect employee  rights.  From an  international viewpoint, Affirmative Action is most often instituted in racial,  ethnic, religious, and gender quotas within public education and civil  services. The most distinctive  historically class-based societies, such as South Africa, China and India, have  imposed stringent measures to promote equal representation of minorities. India, with particularly deep rooted ethnic  barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all major  universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople, former  untouchables and - the latest addition - the &quot;Other Backward Classes.&quot;  (1) Although such measures have been met  with considerable opposition, the prevailing opinion is that they are necessary  to reverse centuries of discrimination, as well as to ensure a continued supply  of business talent within the country.    The success of public sector policies will later determine the need for  similar quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian  Muslim minority groups. Chinas quotas  for Non-Han in the National Assembly have been supplemented with a temporary  exclusion from the 1-child policy for the Non-Han ethnicities, which constitute  9% of the population. In its Employment  Equity Act of 1998, South Africa has taken progressive measures to repeal  discriminatory laws, promote private-sector diversity, and investigate the  causes and depth of Apartheid-driven inequality. (2) Similar quota policies have been exhibited in  Macedonia for their Albanian minority, and in Brazil for Native Brazilians, the  poor, and the disabled.        More specific policies are prevalent  throughout Europe, with Greeces  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealands University Admissions and scholarship  preferences for Maori/Polynesian minorities, the United Kingdoms 1998 Good  Friday Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force, and Malaysias  Bumiputra laws for the Malay Population.    The Affirmative Action policies of Indonesia, Germany, and Belgium, most  clearly mimic those of the United States, where despite having no specific  levels, minorities are often granted employment or university preference with  lesser qualifications.        In contrast, several nations have  actively discouraged and dismissed all racial preference policies. For example, in October 2005, Slovakia passed  legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional, following  several years of temporary balancing strategies to integrate the Slovak Roma  population. (3) In Japan, admission to  all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance exam score, which  excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.       Conclusion               Affirmative Action is as hard an  issue to define as it is to implement.    One must remember that Affirmative Action is an imperfect  solution to an underlying problem , a problem  that is usually not addressed by either side of the issue. In order for Affirmative Action programs to  be successful, racism and sexism must first be addressed. Furthermore, issues of who benefits from the  programs must be refined so as to ensure the proper candidates are being  aided. It would be politically  beneficial to support the use of Affirmative Action programs, while  acknowledging their flaws. A focus on  changes in public education and a balancing of the distribution of wealth is  necessary to address these flaws.

{"detail": [{"content": "Why is Affirmative Action such a Divisive Issue                                               Why is Affirmative Action  such a Divisive Issue?         Affirmative  action is one of the most controversial and divisive issues in America .  Those adverse to it argue that by definition, affirmative action programs are  wholly opposed to the American ideals of personal rights; while those in  support of it feel it is necessary for equality. In order to even begin to  understand the rationale behind affirmative action, it is important to first  define the program's intentions and the premise by which it was founded. Affirmative action proponents propose that  the purpose and logic behind affirmative action is not reverse discrimination  or compensation for years of slavery and oppression. Nor is it government  sanctioned racism, sexism or a rejection of American principles. Instead, it is  argued that the consideration of race or gender, particularly on college  campuses, as one of many deciding factors in admissions processes is an attempt  to create the optimal educational experience for everyone. The implementation  of affirmative action programs on college campuses is said to enhance the  learning environment for all students by allowing for an atmosphere of  diversity, in terms of background and point of view. Most importantly, policies that adjust  admissions processes for minorities attempt to compensate for deeply seeded and  complex social problems. While a system of meritocracy is ideal, it is simply  not practical. In America ,  all are not born on an equal playing field.        The  reasons for such an imbalanced landscape of opportunity are wide and  complicated, ranging from the environments in which many minorities grow up,  varying from family life to educational experience, to household income. The  complex backgrounds of different ethnic groups are integral to understanding why  some feel the need for affirmative action. Yet and still, those opposed to  affirmative action try to separate these ideas. It is dangerously nave and  shortsighted to demarcate race from socio-economic status because the two are  so often intertwined. To grow up white  is to be a part of a family that earns a median income of over $44,000 a year,  but to be born into either a black or Hispanic family means a median family  income of just over $24,000 and $33,000, respectively.  [1]    Furthermore, African American or Hispanic workers, making up 13.8 percent and  11.1 percent of the total labor force, are represented by only 6.5 percent, for  African Americans, and 5 percent, for Hispanics, in the upper management of  corporate America .  Similar statistics on whites show the 69.9 percent of the labor force made up  by Caucasians are represented by 84.5 percent at the executive level.         Another unfortunate statistic,  which highlights the painful racial divide in America , is the percentages of  children, under the age of 18, who live in poverty. According to one study,  10.5 percent of white children live in poverty, while 29 percent of Hispanic  kids and 33 percent of African American youths live below poverty lines.  [2]                 Minorities  fall considerably behind their white counterparts in many categories when it  comes to economic standings, but the implications of such financial disparities  are most evident in the access to superior education whites have compared to  minorities. Mean SAT scores reflect the most fundamental failings of the  public education systems attempt to address the rift between races with whites  and blacks earning marks of 1060 and 857, respectively, a full 200 point  difference.  [3]         In the employment context, not all employers are  required to implement an affirmative action program, generally government  entities and federal contractors.  [4]  In cases where the  employer is required to implement an affirmative action program in employment,  the organization must compare the incumbency of females and minorities performing  specific jobs to the availability of those groups in the recruitment area where  the employer finds its employees. Where the employment incumbency in that job  group is less than 80% of the availability of that group, the organization must  establish an affirmative action goal.  [5]  Thus, when there is a job  opening for that particular job group, the organization must take strides to  recruit qualified members of whatever group is underutilized, minorities or  females. However, once the applicants apply, in theory the organization is  required to select the most qualified candidate and cannot make employment  decisions based on race or sex even where there is an affirmative action goal.    [6]  Critics of corporate  affirmative action programs argue that it can be nearly impossible to determine  in the end whether race or gender was used as a final consideration for  employment resulting again in qualified applicants potentially being  discriminated against solely because of their race or gender.  [7]          Affirmative  action has arguably been more effective in its struggle for gender equality  than it has in ending race disparities; with women comprising more high ranking  positions in corporate settings such as that of business and politics than was  the case just 30 years ago. Yet affirmative action poses a great limitation in  that it fails to recognize the intersections of gender, race, and class. Hence,  while as a gender women have progressed dramatically since much earlier times,  closer analysis reveals that women of color (particularly Blacks and  Hispanics), do not comprise much of this progress. Black women especially are  often overlooked in analyses of the impact or effectiveness of affirmative  action and, even more importantly, in the development of policies and programs  that work against systemic social hierarchies.  [8]    This neglect poses a detriment to affirmative action as it prohibits our  culture from tackling the conflicting ways by which gender, race and class  structure our society.  [9]        Historical        //Also needs more balance with women?           Originally, civil rights programs were  constructed to help African Americans become full citizens of the United States .  This was first written in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 13th  Amendment makes slavery illegal, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection  under the law, and finally the 15th Amendment, &quot;forbids racial  discrimination in access to voting.  [10]    However, these amendments were not enough to actually ensure minorities  equality or the right to vote. The southern states  used a variety of techniques of discrimination including literacy tests,  intimidation, violence, and poll taxes.  [11]    In order to achieve equality in all areas of society more had to be done. In 1986, the Supreme Courts decision in Plessy  v. Ferguson upheld a &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that soon  proved to be anything but equal for minorities. However, in 1954, the Supreme  Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson in the court decision supporting Brown  v. Board of Education , which stated separate could not be equal. This led  to the first instances of Affirmative Action.  [12]     In March 1961, President John F  Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, which established the President  ' s  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Its purpose was to end  discrimination in employment by the government and its contractors. Every  federal contract was required to include the pledge that, &quot;The Contractor  will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because  of race, creed, color, or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative  action, to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated  during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national  origin.&quot;  [13]    This signified the first time the government called for Affirmative Action with  a mission for &quot;equal opportunity in employment.&quot;  [14]        The Civil Rights Act of 1964  restated and broadened the principle of Affirmative Action. Title VI declared  that &quot;No person in the United   States shall, on the ground of race, color  or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  federal financial assistance. However,  within one year President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1965 commencement address  argued that fairness required more than a commitment to impartial treatment. In  his speech he said, &quot;You do not take a person who, for years, has been  hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race  and then say you are free to compete with all the others, and still just  believe that you have been completely fair.&quot; This set the stage for the  contemporary use of affirmative action.  [15]  Several  months later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, requiring all  government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in order  to expand job opportunities for minorities  [16]  ,  and  ,  in   1967, H h e  amended it to include affirmative action for women.  [17]   President Johnsons order was stated in  language very similar to that of President Kennedys; however, Johnson  abolished Kennedys Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and transferred  responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor, authorizing the Secretary to  &quot;adopt such rules and regulation and issue such order as he deems  necessary and appropriate to achieve purposes thereof.&quot;  [18]          It is crucial  to  in   keep in mind that  a  A ffirmative action  is not solely benefiting race differences but gender as well. In preventing  gender discrimination and providing equal opportunities for all sexes, Title IX  has been put in place. Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits  sex discrimination in all education institutions that receive federal funding.  Title IX refers to both employment and admission of students. Violations of  this Title result in withdraw of federal funds or suits by private individuals.  Regulations under Title IX allow affirmative action in instances  cases  in which  members of one sex must be treated differently to overcome the specific effects  of past discrimination.  [19]      At this point in American  history, American law and policy was set against racial discrimination in  workplaces, schoolrooms and public accommodations, as well as in housing and  voting. In recent history, two landmark cases have been Grutter v. Bollinger   and Gratz v. Bollinger . In Grutter v. Bollinger the Supreme Court  under Justice OConnor supported the University of Michigan Law Schools  affirmative action program, specifically endorsing Justice Powells view in  1978s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student  body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in  University admissions.  [20]    The Supreme Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to Bakkes  value as binding precedent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger   upheld the value of student body diversity but decided the use of race in University of Michigan undergraduate schools  affirmative action program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the  universitys asserted interest in diversity. The undergraduate program used a  system that assigned points for certain factors such as geography,  legacy/alumni relationships, and race, while the law school took a more  holistic approach. However, in a  reaction to the Supreme Courts decision in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter  v. Bollinger , University of California Regent Ward Connerly announced his  intention to launch a white initiative to prohibit affirmative action in  education, employment and contracting, which resulted in ending the use of  affirmative action in higher education, public contracting and hiring in  California and Washington State.  [21]          Moral and  Empirical Claims        When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem, as compared their  intended outcomes?        The moral debate tends to center around two major  concepts. The first idea being that  Affirmative Action is reparation for past injustices incurred on American  minorities, and the extent to which reparations are appropriate or  beneficial. For example, the official  position of the American Civil Liberties Union is that affirmative action is a  valuable instrument for leveling what has long been an uneven playing field.  [22]   This The second dominant moral sentiment  argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination where the  inequality is shifted rather than combated, and consequentially violates the  principle of merit that has defined American democracy. The ACLU maintains that affirmative action  merely enables people who might otherwise be shut out, to get their foot in  the door  [23]    and denies that this adversely affects the majority-group applicants. Stanley  Clarke,  Dean of the College   of liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois   at Chicago  summed up  the opposition, when he suggested that  &quot;whites once set  themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges for themselves while  denying them to others. Now, on the  basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves  privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is  no.&quot;   [24]         Empirical claims about  a ffirmative  a ction  generally exist in response to two overarching questions: what is the  underlying cause of the inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action  policies, and what effect have these policies displayed in solving the core  problem. In terms of cause, it is  questioned whether the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of  some innate biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely  social construct. While there is  extensive empirical data, both supporting and refuting the notion of a  race-specific genetic advantage, the controversy that ensues over the  socio-political stigma embedded in the issue often clouds the credibility of  the science involved. The primary  example of such data is the 1994 book The  Bell Curve , which concluded that African Americans have inherently lower  IQs than their white counterparts, and that this discrepancy cannot be  attributed to societal factors. A more  recent study involving Ashkenazi Jews asserts that the  high IQ test  scores of Askenazim, along with their unusual pattern of abilities, are a  product of natural selection, stemming from their occupation of an unusual  social niche.  [25]   Both studies, and their research methods, have  been hotly refuted and defended, leaving them widely inconclusive. The converse  claim attributes the cause of the current racial inequality to prevailing  social policies, attitudes, and racism.    In his 1992 article &quot;Race  and the Schooling of Black Americ  ans,&quot;   Claude Steele makes the argument that the achievement of black students relies  heavily on societal encouragement, and suffers in the face of racism.        The reactionary response to  a ffirmative  action policies seek to measure their  social and economic  efficiency.  . For instance, have the affirmative action  policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the targeted  minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon? A study published in the International Labor Relations Review addressed these issues and  concluded that:         Affirmative Action increases the number of  recruitment and screening practices used by employers, raises employers'  willingness to hire stigmatized applicants, increases the number of minority or  female applicants as well as employees, and increases employers' tendencies to  provide training and formally evaluate employees. When Affirmative Action is  used in recruiting, it generally does not lead to lower credentials or  performance of women and minorities hired.      [26]               A similar 2005 study of affirmative action policies  at three elite universities concluded that  Eliminating affirmative action would significantly  reduce the number of African-Americans and Hispanics admitted to elite  universities, with little gain for White students.  [27]   An opposing study, however, found that  more black and minority police  officers increase crime rates, but this apparently arises because lower hiring  standards involved in recruiting more minority officers reduces the quality of  both new minority and new nonminority officers. The most adverse effects of  these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated areas.  [28]   While limited to racial inequality in a  specified line of work, this data seems conceptually dissents with the position  that Affirmative Action policies are generally beneficial.  When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem?        The moral debate tends to center around the ideas of  justice and entitlement. The first major  question regards whether Affirmative Action is simply reparation for past  injustices incurred on American minorities.    Encompassed within this idea is the supportive idea that such policies  correct for imbedded discrimination within institutions, and enables the  identification of a talented workforce among huge groups of people that have  been historically ignored. The converse  sentiment argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination,  which violates the principle of merit that has defined American democracy.         A more comprehensive moral argument claims that  Affirmative Action misclassifies the recipients of affirmative action in terms  of race, as opposed to a more relevant variable, such as socioeconomic  background. This argument also implies  that such policies fail to address the underlying racism/sexism at the root of  the social imbalance.        Empirical claims about Affirmative Action generally exist  in response to two overarching questions: what is the underlying cause of the  inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem. In terms of cause, it is questioned whether  the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of some innate  biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely social  construct. While various studies have  largely disproved the idea of biological predisposition, the unpopular theory  remains debated, especially with regards to a gender disparity in mathematical  and scientific ability.        Less conclusive studies have been instituted in attempt to  answer questions regarding the social and economic efficiency of affirmative  action policies. For instance, have the affirmative  action policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the  targeted minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon?               Public Opinion               The  issue of affirmative action has not ceased to remain a hot issue with the  public. Opinions vary widely based on  race, gender and economics, and there is no clear consensus on the topic. Overall support for affirmative action  remains slightly above 50% as being considered good for the country, with a  trend leading it from 54% in 1995 to 62% in 2000 and finally 58% in 2001.  [29]   While this support, particularly in 2000, is  not completely split, it does not lead to any decisive stance. Furthermore, different polls, such as one  done by The Washington Post , would show vast differences, such as  approximately 75% opposing affirmative action programs for both minorities and  women.  [30]         When  the issue is divided further there is also fluctuation in support. In 2001, 56% supported affirmative action  programs in regards to college admissions, while 58% supported programs for  minorities and women in regards to job hiring.  [31]   While, this is only a 2% difference, it must  be noted that there is a difference between the two. They are not the same to the public.       Furthermore,  support for programs for women is higher than that for racial minorities. In 2005, 59% were in favor of programs for  women, while only 50% favored those for racial minorities. This is preceded by similar differences in  2003 and 2001.  [32]   Affirmative Action programs for women also  held much higher support when first instituted.    In polls taken in 1995, support shows 85% in favor of having had  programs implemented, while only 49% said they were still needed. However, support has raised to 56% in favor  of programs being needed today when the same poll was administered in 2001.  [33]   This would leave the issue of affirmative  action for women as relatively supported overall; however, a different poll from  1995 showed two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men against programs for  women.  [34]         When  looking at where the different opinions are coming from, there is also a large  variation. Two-thirds of blacks (67%)  but only 36% of whites a 31 percentage-point gap feel that the government  should make every effort to help blacks and other minorities.  Gallup   finds blacks and whites' opinions diverge markedly on questions about policy  preferences and the government's role in addressing racial inequality.  [35]   There is an even greater difference when  looking at a CBS News/N.Y. Times poll, showing 94% of blacks believing  affirmative action programs should be continued, with only 47% of whites  favoring affirmative action. Furthermore,  only 3% of blacks believed programs should be abolished, while 42% of whites  supported abolishing affirmative action programs.  [36]         In  a specific example given of two equally qualified students (one black and one  white) who are applying to the same major university, 47% of Americans said the  students would have an equal chance of being admitted, while 29% said the white  student had a better chance and 20% said the black student. When broken down into what opinions came from  which persons, there is an even more remarkable difference. Fifty percent of non-Hispanic whites said  students have an equal chance, 24% said the black student would have a better  chance, and 21% were in favor of the white student. However, 64% of blacks said the white student  would have a better chance and only 4% said the black student would have a  better chance.  [37]   Regardless, there is a clear consensus that  diversity within colleges is important, 89% of blacks and 78% of whites  favoring it.  [38]         There  is certainly a belief that those who are receiving benefits from affirmative  action are not earning them. A slight  majority (47.6%) believe affirmative action programs are giving preferential  treatment to minorities in school admissions and job hirings even when those  minorities are less qualified than other applicants.  [39]   Preferences stigmatize [minorities] as less  able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they  need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch  away.  [40]   Therefore, while the special treatment may be  helping some, it is leaving a devastating stigma along with the benefits. According to Jeff Jacoby of The Boston  Globe when writing in regards to special awards for minorities only,  Blacks and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome...if only they could be  liberated from the condescending mind-set that thinks it's a compliment to tell  a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  [41]           Finally,  the nation is split into approximate thirds in both 1995 and 2001 when asked if  we should increase, keep the same, or decrease affirmative action programs,  leaving no obvious path for the future of affirmative action in public opinion.  [42]   In political terms, this then leaves a  position on this issue as potentially volatile.    According to David Bositis of the Joint Center   for Political and Economic Studies, Hispanics support affirmative action as  much as blacks do. Even in terms of  suburban whites, [politicians] have to worry...  [43]   Thus, there is a constant risk of alienating  conservatives voters in order to gain minority votes, and as can be seen by the  preceding polls, support varies greatly by both those polling and being polled.      International               Worldwide, policies regarding  race, ethnicity and gender equality in education and employment vary from  strict private-sector quotas that demand minority consideration, to  constitutional laws deeming the same considerations illegal. The most distinctive historically class-based  societies, such as South Africa ,   China and India , have imposed stringent  measures to jumpstart a movement toward equality of minorities.  India , with particularly deep  rooted ethnic barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all  major universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople,  former untouchables and - the latest addition - the Other Backward Classes.  [44]    Although such measures have been met with considerable opposition, the  prevailing opinion is that they are crucial both socially to compensate for  centuries of discrimination, and economically to ensure a continued supply of  business talent within the country. The  success of public sector policies will later dictate the need for similar  quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian Muslim  minority groups.  China s existing quotas for its  Non-Han ethnic minorities in the National Assembly have recently been  supplemented with a temporary exclusion from the 1-child policy for the  Non-Han, which constitute 9% of the population.    Similar quota policies have been exhibited in Macedonia   for their Albanian minority, in Malaysia s  Bumiputra quotas for the Malay Population,    and in Brazil   for Native Brazilians, the poor, and the disabled.         The opposite extreme is seen in  several nations that have actively discouraged or dismissed all racial  preference policies. For example, in  October 2005, Slovakia   passed legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional,  following several unsuccessful years of temporary balancing strategies to  integrate the Slovak Roma population.  [45]    In Japan ,  admission to all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance  exam score, which excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.        In much of the world, however, the national  programs for minority clearly resemble those of the United States . Specific or temporary policies are seen in  many countries, like Greece s  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealand s  University Admissions and scholarship preferences for Maori/Polynesian  minorities, and the United Kingdom s 1998 Good Friday  Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force. Interestingly, some of the most progressive  programs are seen in South   Africa , a country notorious for its history  of violent and convoluted discrimination.    In the Employment Equity Act of 1998  [46]  ,   South Africa   instituted measures to repeal discriminatory laws, promote private-sector  diversity, and investigate the causes and depth of Apartheid-driven and other  inequalities. The act acknowledges  women,  aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, and persons with  disabilities as disadvantaged minority groups, and encourages public and  private sector employers to create and implement realistic plans to increase  diversity over time, while simultaneously assisting in the development of  employee unions and collective bargaining organizations to protect employee  rights.  From an  international viewpoint, Affirmative Action is most often instituted in racial,  ethnic, religious, and gender quotas within public education and civil  services. The most distinctive  historically class-based societies, such as South Africa, China and India, have  imposed stringent measures to promote equal representation of minorities. India, with particularly deep rooted ethnic  barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all major  universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople, former  untouchables and - the latest addition - the &quot;Other Backward Classes.&quot;  (1) Although such measures have been met  with considerable opposition, the prevailing opinion is that they are necessary  to reverse centuries of discrimination, as well as to ensure a continued supply  of business talent within the country.    The success of public sector policies will later determine the need for  similar quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian  Muslim minority groups. Chinas quotas  for Non-Han in the National Assembly have been supplemented with a temporary  exclusion from the 1-child policy for the Non-Han ethnicities, which constitute  9% of the population. In its Employment  Equity Act of 1998, South Africa has taken progressive measures to repeal  discriminatory laws, promote private-sector diversity, and investigate the  causes and depth of Apartheid-driven inequality. (2) Similar quota policies have been exhibited in  Macedonia for their Albanian minority, and in Brazil for Native Brazilians, the  poor, and the disabled.        More specific policies are prevalent  throughout Europe, with Greeces  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealands University Admissions and scholarship  preferences for Maori/Polynesian minorities, the United Kingdoms 1998 Good  Friday Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force, and Malaysias  Bumiputra laws for the Malay Population.    The Affirmative Action policies of Indonesia, Germany, and Belgium, most  clearly mimic those of the United States, where despite having no specific  levels, minorities are often granted employment or university preference with  lesser qualifications.        In contrast, several nations have  actively discouraged and dismissed all racial preference policies. For example, in October 2005, Slovakia passed  legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional, following  several years of temporary balancing strategies to integrate the Slovak Roma  population. (3) In Japan, admission to  all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance exam score, which  excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.       Conclusion               Affirmative Action is as hard an  issue to define as it is to implement.    One must remember that Affirmative Action is an imperfect  solution to an underlying problem , a problem  that is usually not addressed by either side of the issue. In order for Affirmative Action programs to  be successful, racism and sexism must first be addressed. Furthermore, issues of who benefits from the  programs must be refined so as to ensure the proper candidates are being  aided. It would be politically  beneficial to support the use of Affirmative Action programs, while  acknowledging their flaws. A focus on  changes in public education and a balancing of the distribution of wealth is  necessary to address these flaws.

Current alumni are now working at MDRC, the Center on School Effectiveness and Inequality at MIT, Teach for America, the Research and Policy Support Group at the NYC Department of Education, and Graduate NYC!, a research foundation of CUNY.    Read more about some of our recent alumni:         Catherine Corbin       Graduation Date : 2011    Undergraduate Institution: University of California, Santa Barbara, Psychology, Minor: English    Current Job : Technical Analyst in K-12 Education, MDRC    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : While in college, I worked for two after-school programs. One was in a well-funded suburban district in CA, and one was in a low-income district. After college I worked as a special education instructional assistant for just under a year before entering EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? It is difficult to choose just one influential project. Capstone was a wonderful experience that pushed me both academically and personally. Our Capstone project allowed us to delve more deeply into an issue of our choosing while demanding high-level quantitative and analytic solutions and understanding. Working with Meryle Weinstein through this process was phenomenal. Meryle&rsquo;s wealth of relevant policy and methodological knowledge was an outstanding resource to have at our disposal. Working with professors such as Leanna Stiefel and Sean Corcoran also proved to be a challenging and inspirational experience. Both Stiefel and Corcoran come from an Economic background, providing a unique and thrilling lens through which to view and study US Education policy.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? My experience in the Education and Social Policy program was extremely fulfilling. It is hard to find a graduate program in which your voice (and face) will be a familiar one amongst professors directly involved in the program&rsquo;s development. The flexibility in the coursework is also something that I look back on as a wildly beneficial aspect of the program. There are so many frameworks through which you can study education and EDSP exposes you to several, the emphasis being on quantitative methods, and then leaves you the freedom of being able to choose three classes that you can effectively build a specialization with. For those looking for an education policy program built upon a strong foundation in quantitative methods, I highly recommend Education and Social Policy.          Annice Correia       Graduation Date : Summer 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Providence College, Social Science; Public and Community Service Studies minor    Current Job : Program Manager at MIT&rsquo;s School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative    First Job After Graduating the EDSP Program : Operations Analyst at NYC Department of Education    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Case Manager at the Empowerment Program in Denver, CO Voting Rights Coordinator at Colorado Common Cause in Denver, CO Substitute Teacher and Track &amp; Field Coach at Old Rochester Regional School District in Mattapoisett, MA Graduate Student Coordinator at NYU EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? While all of my classes were quite formative and valuable, the most influential courses were Multiple Regression with Leanna Stiefel and Large Data Sets in Education with Sean Corcoran. These rigorous classes introduced me to a new level of quantitative analysis, and I am discovering that such skills are vitally important now that I am working in the field.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I was drawn to the highly structured nature of the program. I also enjoyed the freedom in selecting electives from any NYU school. I took electives from Wagner, Steinhardt, and Silver, allowing me to explore a range of interests as they relate to education policy.          Matthew Harrington       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: Johnson &amp; Wales University, Hospitality Management    Current Job : The New American Academy Charter School, Director of Operations    Previous Work Experience : Project Manager/Business Analyst &ndash; Brooksby Village Retirement Community    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Of all my Professors and projects, Dr. Colleen Larson was the most influential. She was a masterful teacher and had a unique ability to inspire and educate her students. I found her approach so genuine and impactful and she made me truly appreciate qualitative inquiry. I found in graduate school that quantitative research takes top billing. Dr. Larson appreciates the quantitative approach, however, she stresses the importance of context and meaning making in research. She taught me that &ldquo;there is no there there&rdquo; and it is a lesson that I will cherish throughout my career.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP Program? My decision to attend the EDSP program was two-fold. First, the phone call I received from Dr. Corcoran made my decision much easier and made me confident in the idea that I would be joining a small, tight knit program that worked closely with students. I felt as if I was not just going to be a faceless student but rather, I cherished the opportunity to work intimately with my professors and other students.    Secondly, I found the opportunity to be in New York City a desirable one. Unlike other secluded college campuses, NYU, by its very nature, forces interaction and chance encounters due to the demographics of the city. I am a very big believer that success is often dictated by ones willingness to expose oneself to randomness. New York City offered this exposure.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Form bonds/relationships with other classmates early. NYU and the EDSP program can be overwhelming at times. Given that the program is so geared towards statistics, it is very beneficial to be able to call/email other classmates and discuss problems that you get stuck on. The EDSP program is challenging and it was wonderful to collaborate with other classmates and work on solving problems together.          Marissa Hiruma       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: New York University, Major in Economics, Minor in Sociology    Current Job : Program Manager of Education, Graduate Medical Education, NYU School of Medicine    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? My Qualitative Inquiry course was a surprise, and developed in me an incredible interest in qualitative data and analysis. The &ldquo;fieldwork&rdquo; experience was incredibly enlightening. The course provided me with a method by which I could more seamlessly bridge my policy coursework with my quantitative analysis coursework. Professor Bryfman was phenomenal, which of course helped!    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Get as much experience working with large data sets as possible. If I could go back, I definitely would have sought relevant internship experience concurrent to coursework. NYC is an incredible place to learn as a student and a citizen, so to enroll in EDSP and have the city and all of its resources available to you is an incredible and unique opportunity. Take advantage!

Previous Work Experience : Part-time teacher, New Oriental Education and Technology Group Inc    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Professor Leanna Stiefel    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? To obtain both qualitative and quantitative research skills to apply to education issues.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Besides the mandatory courses, the optional course can be very helpful to your study and career too. It&rsquo;s important to know your research interest and to tailor your own study in a smart way.

I appreciated all professors that I have worked with. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Leanna Stiefel, Professor Sean Corcoran, Professor Meryle Weinstein, and Professor Jodi Paroff. They inspired me to explore different fields, helped me find my own interests and strengths, and encouraged me to surmount difficulties. I could not succeed without them.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? I chose EDSP because of its strong emphasis on quantitative analysis. The rigorous analytical courses, such as Econometrics and Applied Statistics, were very appealing to me.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I found courses at NYU very formative and valuable. Treat them seriously and learn as much as possible. Also, take advantage of the location. NYC offers a large number of opportunities for you to apply what you have learnt to the real world..

My research interests have to do with teacher labor markets, including recruiting, teacher education, retainment, incentives, evaluation, the role of standardized testing on such issues, and the impact these issues have on student achievement and career readiness.    Who was the most influential professor that you worked with? : Sean Corcoran was and still is a great mentor. Given our mutual research interests, we discussed many issues during the program, and he gave me a great deal of advice when considering doctoral programs.    Jennifer Hill is also a brilliant statistician, and she is very helpful outside the classroom. I seriously urge everyone to take any course she teaches.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? : I liked the heavy quantitative focus, and being in the heart of NYC is a great place to be for aspiring education policy professionals and academics.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? :Be sure to take Jennifer Hill's course (causal inference) and others if you have space in your schedule. Also, be sure to give a lot of thought to your elective courses. Finally, get as much exposure into different realms of education policy as possible during your program through internships (think tanks, policy institutes, charter networks, academia, etc.)          Lianna Wright                           Faculty, Staff, and Graduating Students, December 2012             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

{"detail": [{"content": "Why is Affirmative Action such a Divisive Issue                                               Why is Affirmative Action  such a Divisive Issue?         Affirmative  action is one of the most controversial and divisive issues in America .  Those adverse to it argue that by definition, affirmative action programs are  wholly opposed to the American ideals of personal rights; while those in  support of it feel it is necessary for equality. In order to even begin to  understand the rationale behind affirmative action, it is important to first  define the program's intentions and the premise by which it was founded. Affirmative action proponents propose that  the purpose and logic behind affirmative action is not reverse discrimination  or compensation for years of slavery and oppression. Nor is it government  sanctioned racism, sexism or a rejection of American principles. Instead, it is  argued that the consideration of race or gender, particularly on college  campuses, as one of many deciding factors in admissions processes is an attempt  to create the optimal educational experience for everyone. The implementation  of affirmative action programs on college campuses is said to enhance the  learning environment for all students by allowing for an atmosphere of  diversity, in terms of background and point of view. Most importantly, policies that adjust  admissions processes for minorities attempt to compensate for deeply seeded and  complex social problems. While a system of meritocracy is ideal, it is simply  not practical. In America ,  all are not born on an equal playing field.        The  reasons for such an imbalanced landscape of opportunity are wide and  complicated, ranging from the environments in which many minorities grow up,  varying from family life to educational experience, to household income. The  complex backgrounds of different ethnic groups are integral to understanding why  some feel the need for affirmative action. Yet and still, those opposed to  affirmative action try to separate these ideas. It is dangerously nave and  shortsighted to demarcate race from socio-economic status because the two are  so often intertwined. To grow up white  is to be a part of a family that earns a median income of over $44,000 a year,  but to be born into either a black or Hispanic family means a median family  income of just over $24,000 and $33,000, respectively.  [1]    Furthermore, African American or Hispanic workers, making up 13.8 percent and  11.1 percent of the total labor force, are represented by only 6.5 percent, for  African Americans, and 5 percent, for Hispanics, in the upper management of  corporate America .  Similar statistics on whites show the 69.9 percent of the labor force made up  by Caucasians are represented by 84.5 percent at the executive level.         Another unfortunate statistic,  which highlights the painful racial divide in America , is the percentages of  children, under the age of 18, who live in poverty. According to one study,  10.5 percent of white children live in poverty, while 29 percent of Hispanic  kids and 33 percent of African American youths live below poverty lines.  [2]                 Minorities  fall considerably behind their white counterparts in many categories when it  comes to economic standings, but the implications of such financial disparities  are most evident in the access to superior education whites have compared to  minorities. Mean SAT scores reflect the most fundamental failings of the  public education systems attempt to address the rift between races with whites  and blacks earning marks of 1060 and 857, respectively, a full 200 point  difference.  [3]         In the employment context, not all employers are  required to implement an affirmative action program, generally government  entities and federal contractors.  [4]  In cases where the  employer is required to implement an affirmative action program in employment,  the organization must compare the incumbency of females and minorities performing  specific jobs to the availability of those groups in the recruitment area where  the employer finds its employees. Where the employment incumbency in that job  group is less than 80% of the availability of that group, the organization must  establish an affirmative action goal.  [5]  Thus, when there is a job  opening for that particular job group, the organization must take strides to  recruit qualified members of whatever group is underutilized, minorities or  females. However, once the applicants apply, in theory the organization is  required to select the most qualified candidate and cannot make employment  decisions based on race or sex even where there is an affirmative action goal.    [6]  Critics of corporate  affirmative action programs argue that it can be nearly impossible to determine  in the end whether race or gender was used as a final consideration for  employment resulting again in qualified applicants potentially being  discriminated against solely because of their race or gender.  [7]          Affirmative  action has arguably been more effective in its struggle for gender equality  than it has in ending race disparities; with women comprising more high ranking  positions in corporate settings such as that of business and politics than was  the case just 30 years ago. Yet affirmative action poses a great limitation in  that it fails to recognize the intersections of gender, race, and class. Hence,  while as a gender women have progressed dramatically since much earlier times,  closer analysis reveals that women of color (particularly Blacks and  Hispanics), do not comprise much of this progress. Black women especially are  often overlooked in analyses of the impact or effectiveness of affirmative  action and, even more importantly, in the development of policies and programs  that work against systemic social hierarchies.  [8]    This neglect poses a detriment to affirmative action as it prohibits our  culture from tackling the conflicting ways by which gender, race and class  structure our society.  [9]        Historical        //Also needs more balance with women?           Originally, civil rights programs were  constructed to help African Americans become full citizens of the United States .  This was first written in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 13th  Amendment makes slavery illegal, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection  under the law, and finally the 15th Amendment, &quot;forbids racial  discrimination in access to voting.  [10]    However, these amendments were not enough to actually ensure minorities  equality or the right to vote. The southern states  used a variety of techniques of discrimination including literacy tests,  intimidation, violence, and poll taxes.  [11]    In order to achieve equality in all areas of society more had to be done. In 1986, the Supreme Courts decision in Plessy  v. Ferguson upheld a &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that soon  proved to be anything but equal for minorities. However, in 1954, the Supreme  Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson in the court decision supporting Brown  v. Board of Education , which stated separate could not be equal. This led  to the first instances of Affirmative Action.  [12]     In March 1961, President John F  Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, which established the President  ' s  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Its purpose was to end  discrimination in employment by the government and its contractors. Every  federal contract was required to include the pledge that, &quot;The Contractor  will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because  of race, creed, color, or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative  action, to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated  during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national  origin.&quot;  [13]    This signified the first time the government called for Affirmative Action with  a mission for &quot;equal opportunity in employment.&quot;  [14]        The Civil Rights Act of 1964  restated and broadened the principle of Affirmative Action. Title VI declared  that &quot;No person in the United   States shall, on the ground of race, color  or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  federal financial assistance. However,  within one year President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1965 commencement address  argued that fairness required more than a commitment to impartial treatment. In  his speech he said, &quot;You do not take a person who, for years, has been  hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race  and then say you are free to compete with all the others, and still just  believe that you have been completely fair.&quot; This set the stage for the  contemporary use of affirmative action.  [15]  Several  months later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, requiring all  government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in order  to expand job opportunities for minorities  [16]  ,  and  ,  in   1967, H h e  amended it to include affirmative action for women.  [17]   President Johnsons order was stated in  language very similar to that of President Kennedys; however, Johnson  abolished Kennedys Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and transferred  responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor, authorizing the Secretary to  &quot;adopt such rules and regulation and issue such order as he deems  necessary and appropriate to achieve purposes thereof.&quot;  [18]          It is crucial  to  in   keep in mind that  a  A ffirmative action  is not solely benefiting race differences but gender as well. In preventing  gender discrimination and providing equal opportunities for all sexes, Title IX  has been put in place. Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits  sex discrimination in all education institutions that receive federal funding.  Title IX refers to both employment and admission of students. Violations of  this Title result in withdraw of federal funds or suits by private individuals.  Regulations under Title IX allow affirmative action in instances  cases  in which  members of one sex must be treated differently to overcome the specific effects  of past discrimination.  [19]      At this point in American  history, American law and policy was set against racial discrimination in  workplaces, schoolrooms and public accommodations, as well as in housing and  voting. In recent history, two landmark cases have been Grutter v. Bollinger   and Gratz v. Bollinger . In Grutter v. Bollinger the Supreme Court  under Justice OConnor supported the University of Michigan Law Schools  affirmative action program, specifically endorsing Justice Powells view in  1978s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student  body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in  University admissions.  [20]    The Supreme Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to Bakkes  value as binding precedent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger   upheld the value of student body diversity but decided the use of race in University of Michigan undergraduate schools  affirmative action program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the  universitys asserted interest in diversity. The undergraduate program used a  system that assigned points for certain factors such as geography,  legacy/alumni relationships, and race, while the law school took a more  holistic approach. However, in a  reaction to the Supreme Courts decision in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter  v. Bollinger , University of California Regent Ward Connerly announced his  intention to launch a white initiative to prohibit affirmative action in  education, employment and contracting, which resulted in ending the use of  affirmative action in higher education, public contracting and hiring in  California and Washington State.  [21]          Moral and  Empirical Claims        When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem, as compared their  intended outcomes?        The moral debate tends to center around two major  concepts. The first idea being that  Affirmative Action is reparation for past injustices incurred on American  minorities, and the extent to which reparations are appropriate or  beneficial. For example, the official  position of the American Civil Liberties Union is that affirmative action is a  valuable instrument for leveling what has long been an uneven playing field.  [22]   This The second dominant moral sentiment  argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination where the  inequality is shifted rather than combated, and consequentially violates the  principle of merit that has defined American democracy. The ACLU maintains that affirmative action  merely enables people who might otherwise be shut out, to get their foot in  the door  [23]    and denies that this adversely affects the majority-group applicants. Stanley  Clarke,  Dean of the College   of liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois   at Chicago  summed up  the opposition, when he suggested that  &quot;whites once set  themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges for themselves while  denying them to others. Now, on the  basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves  privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is  no.&quot;   [24]         Empirical claims about  a ffirmative  a ction  generally exist in response to two overarching questions: what is the  underlying cause of the inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action  policies, and what effect have these policies displayed in solving the core  problem. In terms of cause, it is  questioned whether the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of  some innate biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely  social construct. While there is  extensive empirical data, both supporting and refuting the notion of a  race-specific genetic advantage, the controversy that ensues over the  socio-political stigma embedded in the issue often clouds the credibility of  the science involved. The primary  example of such data is the 1994 book The  Bell Curve , which concluded that African Americans have inherently lower  IQs than their white counterparts, and that this discrepancy cannot be  attributed to societal factors. A more  recent study involving Ashkenazi Jews asserts that the  high IQ test  scores of Askenazim, along with their unusual pattern of abilities, are a  product of natural selection, stemming from their occupation of an unusual  social niche.  [25]   Both studies, and their research methods, have  been hotly refuted and defended, leaving them widely inconclusive. The converse  claim attributes the cause of the current racial inequality to prevailing  social policies, attitudes, and racism.    In his 1992 article &quot;Race  and the Schooling of Black Americ  ans,&quot;   Claude Steele makes the argument that the achievement of black students relies  heavily on societal encouragement, and suffers in the face of racism.        The reactionary response to  a ffirmative  action policies seek to measure their  social and economic  efficiency.  . For instance, have the affirmative action  policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the targeted  minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon? A study published in the International Labor Relations Review addressed these issues and  concluded that:         Affirmative Action increases the number of  recruitment and screening practices used by employers, raises employers'  willingness to hire stigmatized applicants, increases the number of minority or  female applicants as well as employees, and increases employers' tendencies to  provide training and formally evaluate employees. When Affirmative Action is  used in recruiting, it generally does not lead to lower credentials or  performance of women and minorities hired.      [26]               A similar 2005 study of affirmative action policies  at three elite universities concluded that  Eliminating affirmative action would significantly  reduce the number of African-Americans and Hispanics admitted to elite  universities, with little gain for White students.  [27]   An opposing study, however, found that  more black and minority police  officers increase crime rates, but this apparently arises because lower hiring  standards involved in recruiting more minority officers reduces the quality of  both new minority and new nonminority officers. The most adverse effects of  these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated areas.  [28]   While limited to racial inequality in a  specified line of work, this data seems conceptually dissents with the position  that Affirmative Action policies are generally beneficial.  When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem?        The moral debate tends to center around the ideas of  justice and entitlement. The first major  question regards whether Affirmative Action is simply reparation for past  injustices incurred on American minorities.    Encompassed within this idea is the supportive idea that such policies  correct for imbedded discrimination within institutions, and enables the  identification of a talented workforce among huge groups of people that have  been historically ignored. The converse  sentiment argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination,  which violates the principle of merit that has defined American democracy.         A more comprehensive moral argument claims that  Affirmative Action misclassifies the recipients of affirmative action in terms  of race, as opposed to a more relevant variable, such as socioeconomic  background. This argument also implies  that such policies fail to address the underlying racism/sexism at the root of  the social imbalance.        Empirical claims about Affirmative Action generally exist  in response to two overarching questions: what is the underlying cause of the  inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem. In terms of cause, it is questioned whether  the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of some innate  biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely social  construct. While various studies have  largely disproved the idea of biological predisposition, the unpopular theory  remains debated, especially with regards to a gender disparity in mathematical  and scientific ability.        Less conclusive studies have been instituted in attempt to  answer questions regarding the social and economic efficiency of affirmative  action policies. For instance, have the affirmative  action policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the  targeted minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon?               Public Opinion               The  issue of affirmative action has not ceased to remain a hot issue with the  public. Opinions vary widely based on  race, gender and economics, and there is no clear consensus on the topic. Overall support for affirmative action  remains slightly above 50% as being considered good for the country, with a  trend leading it from 54% in 1995 to 62% in 2000 and finally 58% in 2001.  [29]   While this support, particularly in 2000, is  not completely split, it does not lead to any decisive stance. Furthermore, different polls, such as one  done by The Washington Post , would show vast differences, such as  approximately 75% opposing affirmative action programs for both minorities and  women.  [30]         When  the issue is divided further there is also fluctuation in support. In 2001, 56% supported affirmative action  programs in regards to college admissions, while 58% supported programs for  minorities and women in regards to job hiring.  [31]   While, this is only a 2% difference, it must  be noted that there is a difference between the two. They are not the same to the public.       Furthermore,  support for programs for women is higher than that for racial minorities. In 2005, 59% were in favor of programs for  women, while only 50% favored those for racial minorities. This is preceded by similar differences in  2003 and 2001.  [32]   Affirmative Action programs for women also  held much higher support when first instituted.    In polls taken in 1995, support shows 85% in favor of having had  programs implemented, while only 49% said they were still needed. However, support has raised to 56% in favor  of programs being needed today when the same poll was administered in 2001.  [33]   This would leave the issue of affirmative  action for women as relatively supported overall; however, a different poll from  1995 showed two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men against programs for  women.  [34]         When  looking at where the different opinions are coming from, there is also a large  variation. Two-thirds of blacks (67%)  but only 36% of whites a 31 percentage-point gap feel that the government  should make every effort to help blacks and other minorities.  Gallup   finds blacks and whites' opinions diverge markedly on questions about policy  preferences and the government's role in addressing racial inequality.  [35]   There is an even greater difference when  looking at a CBS News/N.Y. Times poll, showing 94% of blacks believing  affirmative action programs should be continued, with only 47% of whites  favoring affirmative action. Furthermore,  only 3% of blacks believed programs should be abolished, while 42% of whites  supported abolishing affirmative action programs.  [36]         In  a specific example given of two equally qualified students (one black and one  white) who are applying to the same major university, 47% of Americans said the  students would have an equal chance of being admitted, while 29% said the white  student had a better chance and 20% said the black student. When broken down into what opinions came from  which persons, there is an even more remarkable difference. Fifty percent of non-Hispanic whites said  students have an equal chance, 24% said the black student would have a better  chance, and 21% were in favor of the white student. However, 64% of blacks said the white student  would have a better chance and only 4% said the black student would have a  better chance.  [37]   Regardless, there is a clear consensus that  diversity within colleges is important, 89% of blacks and 78% of whites  favoring it.  [38]         There  is certainly a belief that those who are receiving benefits from affirmative  action are not earning them. A slight  majority (47.6%) believe affirmative action programs are giving preferential  treatment to minorities in school admissions and job hirings even when those  minorities are less qualified than other applicants.  [39]   Preferences stigmatize [minorities] as less  able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they  need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch  away.  [40]   Therefore, while the special treatment may be  helping some, it is leaving a devastating stigma along with the benefits. According to Jeff Jacoby of The Boston  Globe when writing in regards to special awards for minorities only,  Blacks and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome...if only they could be  liberated from the condescending mind-set that thinks it's a compliment to tell  a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  [41]           Finally,  the nation is split into approximate thirds in both 1995 and 2001 when asked if  we should increase, keep the same, or decrease affirmative action programs,  leaving no obvious path for the future of affirmative action in public opinion.  [42]   In political terms, this then leaves a  position on this issue as potentially volatile.    According to David Bositis of the Joint Center   for Political and Economic Studies, Hispanics support affirmative action as  much as blacks do. Even in terms of  suburban whites, [politicians] have to worry...  [43]   Thus, there is a constant risk of alienating  conservatives voters in order to gain minority votes, and as can be seen by the  preceding polls, support varies greatly by both those polling and being polled.      International               Worldwide, policies regarding  race, ethnicity and gender equality in education and employment vary from  strict private-sector quotas that demand minority consideration, to  constitutional laws deeming the same considerations illegal. The most distinctive historically class-based  societies, such as South Africa ,   China and India , have imposed stringent  measures to jumpstart a movement toward equality of minorities.  India , with particularly deep  rooted ethnic barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all  major universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople,  former untouchables and - the latest addition - the Other Backward Classes.  [44]    Although such measures have been met with considerable opposition, the  prevailing opinion is that they are crucial both socially to compensate for  centuries of discrimination, and economically to ensure a continued supply of  business talent within the country. The  success of public sector policies will later dictate the need for similar  quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian Muslim  minority groups.  China s existing quotas for its  Non-Han ethnic minorities in the National Assembly have recently been  supplemented with a temporary exclusion from the 1-child policy for the  Non-Han, which constitute 9% of the population.    Similar quota policies have been exhibited in Macedonia   for their Albanian minority, in Malaysia s  Bumiputra quotas for the Malay Population,    and in Brazil   for Native Brazilians, the poor, and the disabled.         The opposite extreme is seen in  several nations that have actively discouraged or dismissed all racial  preference policies. For example, in  October 2005, Slovakia   passed legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional,  following several unsuccessful years of temporary balancing strategies to  integrate the Slovak Roma population.  [45]    In Japan ,  admission to all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance  exam score, which excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.        In much of the world, however, the national  programs for minority clearly resemble those of the United States . Specific or temporary policies are seen in  many countries, like Greece s  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealand s  University Admissions and scholarship preferences for Maori/Polynesian  minorities, and the United Kingdom s 1998 Good Friday  Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force. Interestingly, some of the most progressive  programs are seen in South   Africa , a country notorious for its history  of violent and convoluted discrimination.    In the Employment Equity Act of 1998  [46]  ,   South Africa   instituted measures to repeal discriminatory laws, promote private-sector  diversity, and investigate the causes and depth of Apartheid-driven and other  inequalities. The act acknowledges  women,  aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, and persons with  disabilities as disadvantaged minority groups, and encourages public and  private sector employers to create and implement realistic plans to increase  diversity over time, while simultaneously assisting in the development of  employee unions and collective bargaining organizations to protect employee  rights.  From an  international viewpoint, Affirmative Action is most often instituted in racial,  ethnic, religious, and gender quotas within public education and civil  services. The most distinctive  historically class-based societies, such as South Africa, China and India, have  imposed stringent measures to promote equal representation of minorities. India, with particularly deep rooted ethnic  barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all major  universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople, former  untouchables and - the latest addition - the &quot;Other Backward Classes.&quot;  (1) Although such measures have been met  with considerable opposition, the prevailing opinion is that they are necessary  to reverse centuries of discrimination, as well as to ensure a continued supply  of business talent within the country.    The success of public sector policies will later determine the need for  similar quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian  Muslim minority groups. Chinas quotas  for Non-Han in the National Assembly have been supplemented with a temporary  exclusion from the 1-child policy for the Non-Han ethnicities, which constitute  9% of the population. In its Employment  Equity Act of 1998, South Africa has taken progressive measures to repeal  discriminatory laws, promote private-sector diversity, and investigate the  causes and depth of Apartheid-driven inequality. (2) Similar quota policies have been exhibited in  Macedonia for their Albanian minority, and in Brazil for Native Brazilians, the  poor, and the disabled.        More specific policies are prevalent  throughout Europe, with Greeces  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealands University Admissions and scholarship  preferences for Maori/Polynesian minorities, the United Kingdoms 1998 Good  Friday Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force, and Malaysias  Bumiputra laws for the Malay Population.    The Affirmative Action policies of Indonesia, Germany, and Belgium, most  clearly mimic those of the United States, where despite having no specific  levels, minorities are often granted employment or university preference with  lesser qualifications.        In contrast, several nations have  actively discouraged and dismissed all racial preference policies. For example, in October 2005, Slovakia passed  legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional, following  several years of temporary balancing strategies to integrate the Slovak Roma  population. (3) In Japan, admission to  all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance exam score, which  excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.       Conclusion               Affirmative Action is as hard an  issue to define as it is to implement.    One must remember that Affirmative Action is an imperfect  solution to an underlying problem , a problem  that is usually not addressed by either side of the issue. In order for Affirmative Action programs to  be successful, racism and sexism must first be addressed. Furthermore, issues of who benefits from the  programs must be refined so as to ensure the proper candidates are being  aided. It would be politically  beneficial to support the use of Affirmative Action programs, while  acknowledging their flaws. A focus on  changes in public education and a balancing of the distribution of wealth is  necessary to address these flaws.

Current alumni are now working at MDRC, the Center on School Effectiveness and Inequality at MIT, Teach for America, the Research and Policy Support Group at the NYC Department of Education, and Graduate NYC!, a research foundation of CUNY.    Read more about some of our recent alumni:         Catherine Corbin       Graduation Date : 2011    Undergraduate Institution: University of California, Santa Barbara, Psychology, Minor: English    Current Job : Technical Analyst in K-12 Education, MDRC    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : While in college, I worked for two after-school programs. One was in a well-funded suburban district in CA, and one was in a low-income district. After college I worked as a special education instructional assistant for just under a year before entering EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? It is difficult to choose just one influential project. Capstone was a wonderful experience that pushed me both academically and personally. Our Capstone project allowed us to delve more deeply into an issue of our choosing while demanding high-level quantitative and analytic solutions and understanding. Working with Meryle Weinstein through this process was phenomenal. Meryle&rsquo;s wealth of relevant policy and methodological knowledge was an outstanding resource to have at our disposal. Working with professors such as Leanna Stiefel and Sean Corcoran also proved to be a challenging and inspirational experience. Both Stiefel and Corcoran come from an Economic background, providing a unique and thrilling lens through which to view and study US Education policy.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? My experience in the Education and Social Policy program was extremely fulfilling. It is hard to find a graduate program in which your voice (and face) will be a familiar one amongst professors directly involved in the program&rsquo;s development. The flexibility in the coursework is also something that I look back on as a wildly beneficial aspect of the program. There are so many frameworks through which you can study education and EDSP exposes you to several, the emphasis being on quantitative methods, and then leaves you the freedom of being able to choose three classes that you can effectively build a specialization with. For those looking for an education policy program built upon a strong foundation in quantitative methods, I highly recommend Education and Social Policy.          Annice Correia       Graduation Date : Summer 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Providence College, Social Science; Public and Community Service Studies minor    Current Job : Program Manager at MIT&rsquo;s School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative    First Job After Graduating the EDSP Program : Operations Analyst at NYC Department of Education    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Case Manager at the Empowerment Program in Denver, CO Voting Rights Coordinator at Colorado Common Cause in Denver, CO Substitute Teacher and Track &amp; Field Coach at Old Rochester Regional School District in Mattapoisett, MA Graduate Student Coordinator at NYU EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? While all of my classes were quite formative and valuable, the most influential courses were Multiple Regression with Leanna Stiefel and Large Data Sets in Education with Sean Corcoran. These rigorous classes introduced me to a new level of quantitative analysis, and I am discovering that such skills are vitally important now that I am working in the field.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I was drawn to the highly structured nature of the program. I also enjoyed the freedom in selecting electives from any NYU school. I took electives from Wagner, Steinhardt, and Silver, allowing me to explore a range of interests as they relate to education policy.          Matthew Harrington       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: Johnson &amp; Wales University, Hospitality Management    Current Job : The New American Academy Charter School, Director of Operations    Previous Work Experience : Project Manager/Business Analyst &ndash; Brooksby Village Retirement Community    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Of all my Professors and projects, Dr. Colleen Larson was the most influential. She was a masterful teacher and had a unique ability to inspire and educate her students. I found her approach so genuine and impactful and she made me truly appreciate qualitative inquiry. I found in graduate school that quantitative research takes top billing. Dr. Larson appreciates the quantitative approach, however, she stresses the importance of context and meaning making in research. She taught me that &ldquo;there is no there there&rdquo; and it is a lesson that I will cherish throughout my career.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP Program? My decision to attend the EDSP program was two-fold. First, the phone call I received from Dr. Corcoran made my decision much easier and made me confident in the idea that I would be joining a small, tight knit program that worked closely with students. I felt as if I was not just going to be a faceless student but rather, I cherished the opportunity to work intimately with my professors and other students.    Secondly, I found the opportunity to be in New York City a desirable one. Unlike other secluded college campuses, NYU, by its very nature, forces interaction and chance encounters due to the demographics of the city. I am a very big believer that success is often dictated by ones willingness to expose oneself to randomness. New York City offered this exposure.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Form bonds/relationships with other classmates early. NYU and the EDSP program can be overwhelming at times. Given that the program is so geared towards statistics, it is very beneficial to be able to call/email other classmates and discuss problems that you get stuck on. The EDSP program is challenging and it was wonderful to collaborate with other classmates and work on solving problems together.          Marissa Hiruma       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: New York University, Major in Economics, Minor in Sociology    Current Job : Program Manager of Education, Graduate Medical Education, NYU School of Medicine    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? My Qualitative Inquiry course was a surprise, and developed in me an incredible interest in qualitative data and analysis. The &ldquo;fieldwork&rdquo; experience was incredibly enlightening. The course provided me with a method by which I could more seamlessly bridge my policy coursework with my quantitative analysis coursework. Professor Bryfman was phenomenal, which of course helped!    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Get as much experience working with large data sets as possible. If I could go back, I definitely would have sought relevant internship experience concurrent to coursework. NYC is an incredible place to learn as a student and a citizen, so to enroll in EDSP and have the city and all of its resources available to you is an incredible and unique opportunity. Take advantage!

Previous Work Experience : Part-time teacher, New Oriental Education and Technology Group Inc    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Professor Leanna Stiefel    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? To obtain both qualitative and quantitative research skills to apply to education issues.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Besides the mandatory courses, the optional course can be very helpful to your study and career too. It&rsquo;s important to know your research interest and to tailor your own study in a smart way.          Mengwei Luo       Graduation Date : May 2013    Undergraduate Institution: University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Major in Public Administration    Current Job : NYC Human Resource Administration, City Research Scientist II / Project Manager    Previous Work Experience : HR Consulting Intern at Shanghai All-Ways Business Consulting Co.

I appreciated all professors that I have worked with. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Leanna Stiefel, Professor Sean Corcoran, Professor Meryle Weinstein, and Professor Jodi Paroff. They inspired me to explore different fields, helped me find my own interests and strengths, and encouraged me to surmount difficulties. I could not succeed without them.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? I chose EDSP because of its strong emphasis on quantitative analysis. The rigorous analytical courses, such as Econometrics and Applied Statistics, were very appealing to me.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I found courses at NYU very formative and valuable. Treat them seriously and learn as much as possible. Also, take advantage of the location. NYC offers a large number of opportunities for you to apply what you have learnt to the real world..          Nekisha Robertson       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Rutgers University, Major in English    Current Job : Director of Special Projects at Newark Legacy Charter School    First Job after Graduating EDSP Program : Director of Special Projects at Newark Legacy Charter School    Previous Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Office Manager at KIPP Academy Elementary School, Communications Coordinator at Phillips Van- Heusen          Corey Savage       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: University of Massachusetts, Major in Psychology/Biology    Current Job : Doctoral Student at Michigan State University    Description of Current Position : I am beginning a doctoral program in educational policy at MSU with a focus in economics of education. My research interests have to do with teacher labor markets, including recruiting, teacher education, retainment, incentives, evaluation, the role of standardized testing on such issues, and the impact these issues have on student achievement and career readiness.    Who was the most influential professor that you worked with? : Sean Corcoran was and still is a great mentor. Given our mutual research interests, we discussed many issues during the program, and he gave me a great deal of advice when considering doctoral programs.    Jennifer Hill is also a brilliant statistician, and she is very helpful outside the classroom. I seriously urge everyone to take any course she teaches.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? : I liked the heavy quantitative focus, and being in the heart of NYC is a great place to be for aspiring education policy professionals and academics.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? :Be sure to take Jennifer Hill's course (causal inference) and others if you have space in your schedule. Also, be sure to give a lot of thought to your elective courses. Finally, get as much exposure into different realms of education policy as possible during your program through internships (think tanks, policy institutes, charter networks, academia, etc.)          Lianna Wright                           Faculty, Staff, and Graduating Students, December 2012             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

The Center was founded in 2002 with support from the National Science Foundation, and continues to receive funding from various sources (mainly NSF) for continued research on children&rsquo;s developmental transitions in cultural context. The activities of the Center are organized around two large, complementary projects: studies on early childhood (from infancy through age 6 years) and studies on middle childhood and adolescence (from middle school through high school). These two projects are directed by leading scholars in developmental and community psychology, who provide expertise across contexts, developmental stages, and research methodologies. Dozens of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students have participted in the work of the CRCDE and have gone on to pursue further graduate training and recognized careers in psychology and related fields. Center members have published highly acclaimed work on infant and pre-schoolers&rsquo; learning, language, cognitive development, social competence, and emotion and self regulation; children and adolescents&rsquo; school performance, academic achievement, peer relations, and concepts of self; the roles of families, schools, peers, media, workplace, social policies, and culture on the developmental trajectories of young children and youth. This research and related outreach efforts are conducted in continued collaboration and partnerships with hospitals, school systems, and community agencies throughout New York City and beyond. Scientific Mission To accomplish this mission we seek to examine: trajectories of children&#39;s social, emotional, and cognitive development, particularly as children undergo major developmental and social transitions, such as the onset of language and literacy, starting of school, and entry into middle- and high-school children&#39;s experiences in home and school settings, and intersections among different experiences in the two settings the ways in which home and school settings jointly and interactively influence children&#39;s social, emotional, and cognitive development For each aim, we explore ethnic and gender differences in children&#39;s developmental trajectories, home and school experiences, and the intersections between these, with a focus on the ways in which beliefs and practices within cultural communities shape these processes.  Educational Mission      The educational mission of the Center is to      transmit research findings, through training and dissemination,      to three communities:       A new generation of scholars from diverse       backgrounds who are engaged in research on culture and its       role in child learning, engagement, and performance.

Affirmative  action is one of the most controversial and divisive issues in America .  Those adverse to it argue that by definition, affirmative action programs are  wholly opposed to the American ideals of personal rights; while those in  support of it feel it is necessary for equality. In order to even begin to  understand the rationale behind affirmative action, it is important to first  define the program's intentions and the premise by which it was founded. Affirmative action proponents propose that  the purpose and logic behind affirmative action is not reverse discrimination  or compensation for years of slavery and oppression. Nor is it government  sanctioned racism, sexism or a rejection of American principles. Instead, it is  argued that the consideration of race or gender, particularly on college  campuses, as one of many deciding factors in admissions processes is an attempt  to create the optimal educational experience for everyone. The implementation  of affirmative action programs on college campuses is said to enhance the  learning environment for all students by allowing for an atmosphere of  diversity, in terms of background and point of view. Most importantly, policies that adjust  admissions processes for minorities attempt to compensate for deeply seeded and  complex social problems. While a system of meritocracy is ideal, it is simply  not practical. In America ,  all are not born on an equal playing field.        The  reasons for such an imbalanced landscape of opportunity are wide and  complicated, ranging from the environments in which many minorities grow up,  varying from family life to educational experience, to household income. The  complex backgrounds of different ethnic groups are integral to understanding why  some feel the need for affirmative action. Yet and still, those opposed to  affirmative action try to separate these ideas. It is dangerously nave and  shortsighted to demarcate race from socio-economic status because the two are  so often intertwined. To grow up white  is to be a part of a family that earns a median income of over $44,000 a year,  but to be born into either a black or Hispanic family means a median family  income of just over $24,000 and $33,000, respectively.  [1]    Furthermore, African American or Hispanic workers, making up 13.8 percent and  11.1 percent of the total labor force, are represented by only 6.5 percent, for  African Americans, and 5 percent, for Hispanics, in the upper management of  corporate America .  Similar statistics on whites show the 69.9 percent of the labor force made up  by Caucasians are represented by 84.5 percent at the executive level.         Another unfortunate statistic,  which highlights the painful racial divide in America , is the percentages of  children, under the age of 18, who live in poverty. According to one study,  10.5 percent of white children live in poverty, while 29 percent of Hispanic  kids and 33 percent of African American youths live below poverty lines.  [2]                 Minorities  fall considerably behind their white counterparts in many categories when it  comes to economic standings, but the implications of such financial disparities  are most evident in the access to superior education whites have compared to  minorities. Mean SAT scores reflect the most fundamental failings of the  public education systems attempt to address the rift between races with whites  and blacks earning marks of 1060 and 857, respectively, a full 200 point  difference.  [3]         In the employment context, not all employers are  required to implement an affirmative action program, generally government  entities and federal contractors.  [4]  In cases where the  employer is required to implement an affirmative action program in employment,  the organization must compare the incumbency of females and minorities performing  specific jobs to the availability of those groups in the recruitment area where  the employer finds its employees. Where the employment incumbency in that job  group is less than 80% of the availability of that group, the organization must  establish an affirmative action goal.  [5]  Thus, when there is a job  opening for that particular job group, the organization must take strides to  recruit qualified members of whatever group is underutilized, minorities or  females. However, once the applicants apply, in theory the organization is  required to select the most qualified candidate and cannot make employment  decisions based on race or sex even where there is an affirmative action goal.    [6]  Critics of corporate  affirmative action programs argue that it can be nearly impossible to determine  in the end whether race or gender was used as a final consideration for  employment resulting again in qualified applicants potentially being  discriminated against solely because of their race or gender.  [7]          Affirmative  action has arguably been more effective in its struggle for gender equality  than it has in ending race disparities; with women comprising more high ranking  positions in corporate settings such as that of business and politics than was  the case just 30 years ago. Yet affirmative action poses a great limitation in  that it fails to recognize the intersections of gender, race, and class. Hence,  while as a gender women have progressed dramatically since much earlier times,  closer analysis reveals that women of color (particularly Blacks and  Hispanics), do not comprise much of this progress. Black women especially are  often overlooked in analyses of the impact or effectiveness of affirmative  action and, even more importantly, in the development of policies and programs  that work against systemic social hierarchies.  [8]    This neglect poses a detriment to affirmative action as it prohibits our  culture from tackling the conflicting ways by which gender, race and class  structure our society.  [9]        Historical        //Also needs more balance with women?           Originally, civil rights programs were  constructed to help African Americans become full citizens of the United States .  This was first written in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 13th  Amendment makes slavery illegal, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection  under the law, and finally the 15th Amendment, &quot;forbids racial  discrimination in access to voting.  [10]    However, these amendments were not enough to actually ensure minorities  equality or the right to vote. The southern states  used a variety of techniques of discrimination including literacy tests,  intimidation, violence, and poll taxes.  [11]    In order to achieve equality in all areas of society more had to be done. In 1986, the Supreme Courts decision in Plessy  v. Ferguson upheld a &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that soon  proved to be anything but equal for minorities. However, in 1954, the Supreme  Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson in the court decision supporting Brown  v. Board of Education , which stated separate could not be equal. This led  to the first instances of Affirmative Action.  [12]     In March 1961, President John F  Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, which established the President  ' s  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Its purpose was to end  discrimination in employment by the government and its contractors. Every  federal contract was required to include the pledge that, &quot;The Contractor  will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because  of race, creed, color, or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative  action, to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated  during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national  origin.&quot;  [13]    This signified the first time the government called for Affirmative Action with  a mission for &quot;equal opportunity in employment.&quot;  [14]        The Civil Rights Act of 1964  restated and broadened the principle of Affirmative Action. Title VI declared  that &quot;No person in the United   States shall, on the ground of race, color  or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  federal financial assistance. However,  within one year President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1965 commencement address  argued that fairness required more than a commitment to impartial treatment. In  his speech he said, &quot;You do not take a person who, for years, has been  hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race  and then say you are free to compete with all the others, and still just  believe that you have been completely fair.&quot; This set the stage for the  contemporary use of affirmative action.  [15]  Several  months later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, requiring all  government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in order  to expand job opportunities for minorities  [16]  ,  and  ,  in   1967, H h e  amended it to include affirmative action for women.  [17]   President Johnsons order was stated in  language very similar to that of President Kennedys; however, Johnson  abolished Kennedys Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and transferred  responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor, authorizing the Secretary to  &quot;adopt such rules and regulation and issue such order as he deems  necessary and appropriate to achieve purposes thereof.&quot;  [18]          It is crucial  to  in   keep in mind that  a  A ffirmative action  is not solely benefiting race differences but gender as well. In preventing  gender discrimination and providing equal opportunities for all sexes, Title IX  has been put in place. Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits  sex discrimination in all education institutions that receive federal funding.  Title IX refers to both employment and admission of students. Violations of  this Title result in withdraw of federal funds or suits by private individuals.  Regulations under Title IX allow affirmative action in instances  cases  in which  members of one sex must be treated differently to overcome the specific effects  of past discrimination.  [19]      At this point in American  history, American law and policy was set against racial discrimination in  workplaces, schoolrooms and public accommodations, as well as in housing and  voting. In recent history, two landmark cases have been Grutter v. Bollinger   and Gratz v. Bollinger . In Grutter v. Bollinger the Supreme Court  under Justice OConnor supported the University of Michigan Law Schools  affirmative action program, specifically endorsing Justice Powells view in  1978s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student  body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in  University admissions.  [20]    The Supreme Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to Bakkes  value as binding precedent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger   upheld the value of student body diversity but decided the use of race in University of Michigan undergraduate schools  affirmative action program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the  universitys asserted interest in diversity. The undergraduate program used a  system that assigned points for certain factors such as geography,  legacy/alumni relationships, and race, while the law school took a more  holistic approach. However, in a  reaction to the Supreme Courts decision in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter  v. Bollinger , University of California Regent Ward Connerly announced his  intention to launch a white initiative to prohibit affirmative action in  education, employment and contracting, which resulted in ending the use of  affirmative action in higher education, public contracting and hiring in  California and Washington State.  [21]          Moral and  Empirical Claims        When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem, as compared their  intended outcomes?        The moral debate tends to center around two major  concepts. The first idea being that  Affirmative Action is reparation for past injustices incurred on American  minorities, and the extent to which reparations are appropriate or  beneficial. For example, the official  position of the American Civil Liberties Union is that affirmative action is a  valuable instrument for leveling what has long been an uneven playing field.  [22]   This The second dominant moral sentiment  argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination where the  inequality is shifted rather than combated, and consequentially violates the  principle of merit that has defined American democracy. The ACLU maintains that affirmative action  merely enables people who might otherwise be shut out, to get their foot in  the door  [23]    and denies that this adversely affects the majority-group applicants. Stanley  Clarke,  Dean of the College   of liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois   at Chicago  summed up  the opposition, when he suggested that  &quot;whites once set  themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges for themselves while  denying them to others. Now, on the  basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves  privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is  no.&quot;   [24]         Empirical claims about  a ffirmative  a ction  generally exist in response to two overarching questions: what is the  underlying cause of the inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action  policies, and what effect have these policies displayed in solving the core  problem. In terms of cause, it is  questioned whether the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of  some innate biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely  social construct. While there is  extensive empirical data, both supporting and refuting the notion of a  race-specific genetic advantage, the controversy that ensues over the  socio-political stigma embedded in the issue often clouds the credibility of  the science involved. The primary  example of such data is the 1994 book The  Bell Curve , which concluded that African Americans have inherently lower  IQs than their white counterparts, and that this discrepancy cannot be  attributed to societal factors. A more  recent study involving Ashkenazi Jews asserts that the  high IQ test  scores of Askenazim, along with their unusual pattern of abilities, are a  product of natural selection, stemming from their occupation of an unusual  social niche.  [25]   Both studies, and their research methods, have  been hotly refuted and defended, leaving them widely inconclusive. The converse  claim attributes the cause of the current racial inequality to prevailing  social policies, attitudes, and racism.    In his 1992 article &quot;Race  and the Schooling of Black Americ  ans,&quot;   Claude Steele makes the argument that the achievement of black students relies  heavily on societal encouragement, and suffers in the face of racism.        The reactionary response to  a ffirmative  action policies seek to measure their  social and economic  efficiency.  . For instance, have the affirmative action  policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the targeted  minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon? A study published in the International Labor Relations Review addressed these issues and  concluded that:         Affirmative Action increases the number of  recruitment and screening practices used by employers, raises employers'  willingness to hire stigmatized applicants, increases the number of minority or  female applicants as well as employees, and increases employers' tendencies to  provide training and formally evaluate employees. When Affirmative Action is  used in recruiting, it generally does not lead to lower credentials or  performance of women and minorities hired.      [26]               A similar 2005 study of affirmative action policies  at three elite universities concluded that  Eliminating affirmative action would significantly  reduce the number of African-Americans and Hispanics admitted to elite  universities, with little gain for White students.  [27]   An opposing study, however, found that  more black and minority police  officers increase crime rates, but this apparently arises because lower hiring  standards involved in recruiting more minority officers reduces the quality of  both new minority and new nonminority officers. The most adverse effects of  these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated areas.  [28]   While limited to racial inequality in a  specified line of work, this data seems conceptually dissents with the position  that Affirmative Action policies are generally beneficial.  When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem?        The moral debate tends to center around the ideas of  justice and entitlement. The first major  question regards whether Affirmative Action is simply reparation for past  injustices incurred on American minorities.    Encompassed within this idea is the supportive idea that such policies  correct for imbedded discrimination within institutions, and enables the  identification of a talented workforce among huge groups of people that have  been historically ignored. The converse  sentiment argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination,  which violates the principle of merit that has defined American democracy.         A more comprehensive moral argument claims that  Affirmative Action misclassifies the recipients of affirmative action in terms  of race, as opposed to a more relevant variable, such as socioeconomic  background. This argument also implies  that such policies fail to address the underlying racism/sexism at the root of  the social imbalance.        Empirical claims about Affirmative Action generally exist  in response to two overarching questions: what is the underlying cause of the  inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem. In terms of cause, it is questioned whether  the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of some innate  biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely social  construct. While various studies have  largely disproved the idea of biological predisposition, the unpopular theory  remains debated, especially with regards to a gender disparity in mathematical  and scientific ability.        Less conclusive studies have been instituted in attempt to  answer questions regarding the social and economic efficiency of affirmative  action policies. For instance, have the affirmative  action policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the  targeted minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon?               Public Opinion               The  issue of affirmative action has not ceased to remain a hot issue with the  public. Opinions vary widely based on  race, gender and economics, and there is no clear consensus on the topic. Overall support for affirmative action  remains slightly above 50% as being considered good for the country, with a  trend leading it from 54% in 1995 to 62% in 2000 and finally 58% in 2001.  [29]   While this support, particularly in 2000, is  not completely split, it does not lead to any decisive stance. Furthermore, different polls, such as one  done by The Washington Post , would show vast differences, such as  approximately 75% opposing affirmative action programs for both minorities and  women.  [30]         When  the issue is divided further there is also fluctuation in support. In 2001, 56% supported affirmative action  programs in regards to college admissions, while 58% supported programs for  minorities and women in regards to job hiring.  [31]   While, this is only a 2% difference, it must  be noted that there is a difference between the two. They are not the same to the public.       Furthermore,  support for programs for women is higher than that for racial minorities. In 2005, 59% were in favor of programs for  women, while only 50% favored those for racial minorities. This is preceded by similar differences in  2003 and 2001.  [32]   Affirmative Action programs for women also  held much higher support when first instituted.    In polls taken in 1995, support shows 85% in favor of having had  programs implemented, while only 49% said they were still needed. However, support has raised to 56% in favor  of programs being needed today when the same poll was administered in 2001.  [33]   This would leave the issue of affirmative  action for women as relatively supported overall; however, a different poll from  1995 showed two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men against programs for  women.  [34]         When  looking at where the different opinions are coming from, there is also a large  variation. Two-thirds of blacks (67%)  but only 36% of whites a 31 percentage-point gap feel that the government  should make every effort to help blacks and other minorities.  Gallup   finds blacks and whites' opinions diverge markedly on questions about policy  preferences and the government's role in addressing racial inequality.  [35]   There is an even greater difference when  looking at a CBS News/N.Y. Times poll, showing 94% of blacks believing  affirmative action programs should be continued, with only 47% of whites  favoring affirmative action. Furthermore,  only 3% of blacks believed programs should be abolished, while 42% of whites  supported abolishing affirmative action programs.  [36]         In  a specific example given of two equally qualified students (one black and one  white) who are applying to the same major university, 47% of Americans said the  students would have an equal chance of being admitted, while 29% said the white  student had a better chance and 20% said the black student. When broken down into what opinions came from  which persons, there is an even more remarkable difference. Fifty percent of non-Hispanic whites said  students have an equal chance, 24% said the black student would have a better  chance, and 21% were in favor of the white student. However, 64% of blacks said the white student  would have a better chance and only 4% said the black student would have a  better chance.  [37]   Regardless, there is a clear consensus that  diversity within colleges is important, 89% of blacks and 78% of whites  favoring it.  [38]         There  is certainly a belief that those who are receiving benefits from affirmative  action are not earning them. A slight  majority (47.6%) believe affirmative action programs are giving preferential  treatment to minorities in school admissions and job hirings even when those  minorities are less qualified than other applicants.  [39]   Preferences stigmatize [minorities] as less  able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they  need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch  away.  [40]   Therefore, while the special treatment may be  helping some, it is leaving a devastating stigma along with the benefits. According to Jeff Jacoby of The Boston  Globe when writing in regards to special awards for minorities only,  Blacks and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome...if only they could be  liberated from the condescending mind-set that thinks it's a compliment to tell  a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  [41]           Finally,  the nation is split into approximate thirds in both 1995 and 2001 when asked if  we should increase, keep the same, or decrease affirmative action programs,  leaving no obvious path for the future of affirmative action in public opinion.  [42]   In political terms, this then leaves a  position on this issue as potentially volatile.    According to David Bositis of the Joint Center   for Political and Economic Studies, Hispanics support affirmative action as  much as blacks do. Even in terms of  suburban whites, [politicians] have to worry...  [43]   Thus, there is a constant risk of alienating  conservatives voters in order to gain minority votes, and as can be seen by the  preceding polls, support varies greatly by both those polling and being polled.      International               Worldwide, policies regarding  race, ethnicity and gender equality in education and employment vary from  strict private-sector quotas that demand minority consideration, to  constitutional laws deeming the same considerations illegal. The most distinctive historically class-based  societies, such as South Africa ,   China and India , have imposed stringent  measures to jumpstart a movement toward equality of minorities.  India , with particularly deep  rooted ethnic barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all  major universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople,  former untouchables and - the latest addition - the Other Backward Classes.  [44]    Although such measures have been met with considerable opposition, the  prevailing opinion is that they are crucial both socially to compensate for  centuries of discrimination, and economically to ensure a continued supply of  business talent within the country. The  success of public sector policies will later dictate the need for similar  quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian Muslim  minority groups.  China s existing quotas for its  Non-Han ethnic minorities in the National Assembly have recently been  supplemented with a temporary exclusion from the 1-child policy for the  Non-Han, which constitute 9% of the population.    Similar quota policies have been exhibited in Macedonia   for their Albanian minority, in Malaysia s  Bumiputra quotas for the Malay Population,    and in Brazil   for Native Brazilians, the poor, and the disabled.         The opposite extreme is seen in  several nations that have actively discouraged or dismissed all racial  preference policies. For example, in  October 2005, Slovakia   passed legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional,  following several unsuccessful years of temporary balancing strategies to  integrate the Slovak Roma population.  [45]    In Japan ,  admission to all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance  exam score, which excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.        In much of the world, however, the national  programs for minority clearly resemble those of the United States . Specific or temporary policies are seen in  many countries, like Greece s  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealand s  University Admissions and scholarship preferences for Maori/Polynesian  minorities, and the United Kingdom s 1998 Good Friday  Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force. Interestingly, some of the most progressive  programs are seen in South   Africa , a country notorious for its history  of violent and convoluted discrimination.    In the Employment Equity Act of 1998  [46]  ,   South Africa   instituted measures to repeal discriminatory laws, promote private-sector  diversity, and investigate the causes and depth of Apartheid-driven and other  inequalities. The act acknowledges  women,  aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, and persons with  disabilities as disadvantaged minority groups, and encourages public and  private sector employers to create and implement realistic plans to increase  diversity over time, while simultaneously assisting in the development of  employee unions and collective bargaining organizations to protect employee  rights.  From an  international viewpoint, Affirmative Action is most often instituted in racial,  ethnic, religious, and gender quotas within public education and civil  services. The most distinctive  historically class-based societies, such as South Africa, China and India, have  imposed stringent measures to promote equal representation of minorities. India, with particularly deep rooted ethnic  barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all major  universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople, former  untouchables and - the latest addition - the &quot;Other Backward Classes.&quot;  (1) Although such measures have been met  with considerable opposition, the prevailing opinion is that they are necessary  to reverse centuries of discrimination, as well as to ensure a continued supply  of business talent within the country.    The success of public sector policies will later determine the need for  similar quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian  Muslim minority groups. Chinas quotas  for Non-Han in the National Assembly have been supplemented with a temporary  exclusion from the 1-child policy for the Non-Han ethnicities, which constitute  9% of the population. In its Employment  Equity Act of 1998, South Africa has taken progressive measures to repeal  discriminatory laws, promote private-sector diversity, and investigate the  causes and depth of Apartheid-driven inequality. (2) Similar quota policies have been exhibited in  Macedonia for their Albanian minority, and in Brazil for Native Brazilians, the  poor, and the disabled.        More specific policies are prevalent  throughout Europe, with Greeces  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealands University Admissions and scholarship  preferences for Maori/Polynesian minorities, the United Kingdoms 1998 Good  Friday Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force, and Malaysias  Bumiputra laws for the Malay Population.    The Affirmative Action policies of Indonesia, Germany, and Belgium, most  clearly mimic those of the United States, where despite having no specific  levels, minorities are often granted employment or university preference with  lesser qualifications.        In contrast, several nations have  actively discouraged and dismissed all racial preference policies. For example, in October 2005, Slovakia passed  legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional, following  several years of temporary balancing strategies to integrate the Slovak Roma  population. (3) In Japan, admission to  all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance exam score, which  excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.       Conclusion               Affirmative Action is as hard an  issue to define as it is to implement.    One must remember that Affirmative Action is an imperfect  solution to an underlying problem , a problem  that is usually not addressed by either side of the issue. In order for Affirmative Action programs to  be successful, racism and sexism must first be addressed. Furthermore, issues of who benefits from the  programs must be refined so as to ensure the proper candidates are being  aided. It would be politically  beneficial to support the use of Affirmative Action programs, while  acknowledging their flaws. A focus on  changes in public education and a balancing of the distribution of wealth is  necessary to address these flaws.

{"detail": [{"content": "Why is Affirmative Action such a Divisive Issue                                               Why is Affirmative Action  such a Divisive Issue?         Affirmative  action is one of the most controversial and divisive issues in America .  Those adverse to it argue that by definition, affirmative action programs are  wholly opposed to the American ideals of personal rights; while those in  support of it feel it is necessary for equality. In order to even begin to  understand the rationale behind affirmative action, it is important to first  define the program's intentions and the premise by which it was founded. Affirmative action proponents propose that  the purpose and logic behind affirmative action is not reverse discrimination  or compensation for years of slavery and oppression. Nor is it government  sanctioned racism, sexism or a rejection of American principles. Instead, it is  argued that the consideration of race or gender, particularly on college  campuses, as one of many deciding factors in admissions processes is an attempt  to create the optimal educational experience for everyone. The implementation  of affirmative action programs on college campuses is said to enhance the  learning environment for all students by allowing for an atmosphere of  diversity, in terms of background and point of view. Most importantly, policies that adjust  admissions processes for minorities attempt to compensate for deeply seeded and  complex social problems. While a system of meritocracy is ideal, it is simply  not practical. In America ,  all are not born on an equal playing field.        The  reasons for such an imbalanced landscape of opportunity are wide and  complicated, ranging from the environments in which many minorities grow up,  varying from family life to educational experience, to household income. The  complex backgrounds of different ethnic groups are integral to understanding why  some feel the need for affirmative action. Yet and still, those opposed to  affirmative action try to separate these ideas. It is dangerously nave and  shortsighted to demarcate race from socio-economic status because the two are  so often intertwined. To grow up white  is to be a part of a family that earns a median income of over $44,000 a year,  but to be born into either a black or Hispanic family means a median family  income of just over $24,000 and $33,000, respectively.  [1]    Furthermore, African American or Hispanic workers, making up 13.8 percent and  11.1 percent of the total labor force, are represented by only 6.5 percent, for  African Americans, and 5 percent, for Hispanics, in the upper management of  corporate America .  Similar statistics on whites show the 69.9 percent of the labor force made up  by Caucasians are represented by 84.5 percent at the executive level.         Another unfortunate statistic,  which highlights the painful racial divide in America , is the percentages of  children, under the age of 18, who live in poverty. According to one study,  10.5 percent of white children live in poverty, while 29 percent of Hispanic  kids and 33 percent of African American youths live below poverty lines.  [2]                 Minorities  fall considerably behind their white counterparts in many categories when it  comes to economic standings, but the implications of such financial disparities  are most evident in the access to superior education whites have compared to  minorities. Mean SAT scores reflect the most fundamental failings of the  public education systems attempt to address the rift between races with whites  and blacks earning marks of 1060 and 857, respectively, a full 200 point  difference.  [3]         In the employment context, not all employers are  required to implement an affirmative action program, generally government  entities and federal contractors.  [4]  In cases where the  employer is required to implement an affirmative action program in employment,  the organization must compare the incumbency of females and minorities performing  specific jobs to the availability of those groups in the recruitment area where  the employer finds its employees. Where the employment incumbency in that job  group is less than 80% of the availability of that group, the organization must  establish an affirmative action goal.  [5]  Thus, when there is a job  opening for that particular job group, the organization must take strides to  recruit qualified members of whatever group is underutilized, minorities or  females. However, once the applicants apply, in theory the organization is  required to select the most qualified candidate and cannot make employment  decisions based on race or sex even where there is an affirmative action goal.    [6]  Critics of corporate  affirmative action programs argue that it can be nearly impossible to determine  in the end whether race or gender was used as a final consideration for  employment resulting again in qualified applicants potentially being  discriminated against solely because of their race or gender.  [7]          Affirmative  action has arguably been more effective in its struggle for gender equality  than it has in ending race disparities; with women comprising more high ranking  positions in corporate settings such as that of business and politics than was  the case just 30 years ago. Yet affirmative action poses a great limitation in  that it fails to recognize the intersections of gender, race, and class. Hence,  while as a gender women have progressed dramatically since much earlier times,  closer analysis reveals that women of color (particularly Blacks and  Hispanics), do not comprise much of this progress. Black women especially are  often overlooked in analyses of the impact or effectiveness of affirmative  action and, even more importantly, in the development of policies and programs  that work against systemic social hierarchies.  [8]    This neglect poses a detriment to affirmative action as it prohibits our  culture from tackling the conflicting ways by which gender, race and class  structure our society.  [9]        Historical        //Also needs more balance with women?           Originally, civil rights programs were  constructed to help African Americans become full citizens of the United States .  This was first written in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 13th  Amendment makes slavery illegal, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection  under the law, and finally the 15th Amendment, &quot;forbids racial  discrimination in access to voting.  [10]    However, these amendments were not enough to actually ensure minorities  equality or the right to vote. The southern states  used a variety of techniques of discrimination including literacy tests,  intimidation, violence, and poll taxes.  [11]    In order to achieve equality in all areas of society more had to be done. In 1986, the Supreme Courts decision in Plessy  v. Ferguson upheld a &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that soon  proved to be anything but equal for minorities. However, in 1954, the Supreme  Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson in the court decision supporting Brown  v. Board of Education , which stated separate could not be equal. This led  to the first instances of Affirmative Action.  [12]     In March 1961, President John F  Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, which established the President  ' s  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Its purpose was to end  discrimination in employment by the government and its contractors. Every  federal contract was required to include the pledge that, &quot;The Contractor  will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because  of race, creed, color, or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative  action, to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated  during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national  origin.&quot;  [13]    This signified the first time the government called for Affirmative Action with  a mission for &quot;equal opportunity in employment.&quot;  [14]        The Civil Rights Act of 1964  restated and broadened the principle of Affirmative Action. Title VI declared  that &quot;No person in the United   States shall, on the ground of race, color  or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  federal financial assistance. However,  within one year President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1965 commencement address  argued that fairness required more than a commitment to impartial treatment. In  his speech he said, &quot;You do not take a person who, for years, has been  hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race  and then say you are free to compete with all the others, and still just  believe that you have been completely fair.&quot; This set the stage for the  contemporary use of affirmative action.  [15]  Several  months later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, requiring all  government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in order  to expand job opportunities for minorities  [16]  ,  and  ,  in   1967, H h e  amended it to include affirmative action for women.  [17]   President Johnsons order was stated in  language very similar to that of President Kennedys; however, Johnson  abolished Kennedys Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and transferred  responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor, authorizing the Secretary to  &quot;adopt such rules and regulation and issue such order as he deems  necessary and appropriate to achieve purposes thereof.&quot;  [18]          It is crucial  to  in   keep in mind that  a  A ffirmative action  is not solely benefiting race differences but gender as well. In preventing  gender discrimination and providing equal opportunities for all sexes, Title IX  has been put in place. Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits  sex discrimination in all education institutions that receive federal funding.  Title IX refers to both employment and admission of students. Violations of  this Title result in withdraw of federal funds or suits by private individuals.  Regulations under Title IX allow affirmative action in instances  cases  in which  members of one sex must be treated differently to overcome the specific effects  of past discrimination.  [19]      At this point in American  history, American law and policy was set against racial discrimination in  workplaces, schoolrooms and public accommodations, as well as in housing and  voting. In recent history, two landmark cases have been Grutter v. Bollinger   and Gratz v. Bollinger . In Grutter v. Bollinger the Supreme Court  under Justice OConnor supported the University of Michigan Law Schools  affirmative action program, specifically endorsing Justice Powells view in  1978s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student  body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in  University admissions.  [20]    The Supreme Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to Bakkes  value as binding precedent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger   upheld the value of student body diversity but decided the use of race in University of Michigan undergraduate schools  affirmative action program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the  universitys asserted interest in diversity. The undergraduate program used a  system that assigned points for certain factors such as geography,  legacy/alumni relationships, and race, while the law school took a more  holistic approach. However, in a  reaction to the Supreme Courts decision in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter  v. Bollinger , University of California Regent Ward Connerly announced his  intention to launch a white initiative to prohibit affirmative action in  education, employment and contracting, which resulted in ending the use of  affirmative action in higher education, public contracting and hiring in  California and Washington State.  [21]          Moral and  Empirical Claims        When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem, as compared their  intended outcomes?        The moral debate tends to center around two major  concepts. The first idea being that  Affirmative Action is reparation for past injustices incurred on American  minorities, and the extent to which reparations are appropriate or  beneficial. For example, the official  position of the American Civil Liberties Union is that affirmative action is a  valuable instrument for leveling what has long been an uneven playing field.  [22]   This The second dominant moral sentiment  argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination where the  inequality is shifted rather than combated, and consequentially violates the  principle of merit that has defined American democracy. The ACLU maintains that affirmative action  merely enables people who might otherwise be shut out, to get their foot in  the door  [23]    and denies that this adversely affects the majority-group applicants. Stanley  Clarke,  Dean of the College   of liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois   at Chicago  summed up  the opposition, when he suggested that  &quot;whites once set  themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges for themselves while  denying them to others. Now, on the  basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves  privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is  no.&quot;   [24]         Empirical claims about  a ffirmative  a ction  generally exist in response to two overarching questions: what is the  underlying cause of the inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action  policies, and what effect have these policies displayed in solving the core  problem. In terms of cause, it is  questioned whether the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of  some innate biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely  social construct. While there is  extensive empirical data, both supporting and refuting the notion of a  race-specific genetic advantage, the controversy that ensues over the  socio-political stigma embedded in the issue often clouds the credibility of  the science involved. The primary  example of such data is the 1994 book The  Bell Curve , which concluded that African Americans have inherently lower  IQs than their white counterparts, and that this discrepancy cannot be  attributed to societal factors. A more  recent study involving Ashkenazi Jews asserts that the  high IQ test  scores of Askenazim, along with their unusual pattern of abilities, are a  product of natural selection, stemming from their occupation of an unusual  social niche.  [25]   Both studies, and their research methods, have  been hotly refuted and defended, leaving them widely inconclusive. The converse  claim attributes the cause of the current racial inequality to prevailing  social policies, attitudes, and racism.    In his 1992 article &quot;Race  and the Schooling of Black Americ  ans,&quot;   Claude Steele makes the argument that the achievement of black students relies  heavily on societal encouragement, and suffers in the face of racism.        The reactionary response to  a ffirmative  action policies seek to measure their  social and economic  efficiency.  . For instance, have the affirmative action  policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the targeted  minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon? A study published in the International Labor Relations Review addressed these issues and  concluded that:         Affirmative Action increases the number of  recruitment and screening practices used by employers, raises employers'  willingness to hire stigmatized applicants, increases the number of minority or  female applicants as well as employees, and increases employers' tendencies to  provide training and formally evaluate employees. When Affirmative Action is  used in recruiting, it generally does not lead to lower credentials or  performance of women and minorities hired.      [26]               A similar 2005 study of affirmative action policies  at three elite universities concluded that  Eliminating affirmative action would significantly  reduce the number of African-Americans and Hispanics admitted to elite  universities, with little gain for White students.  [27]   An opposing study, however, found that  more black and minority police  officers increase crime rates, but this apparently arises because lower hiring  standards involved in recruiting more minority officers reduces the quality of  both new minority and new nonminority officers. The most adverse effects of  these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated areas.  [28]   While limited to racial inequality in a  specified line of work, this data seems conceptually dissents with the position  that Affirmative Action policies are generally beneficial.  When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem?        The moral debate tends to center around the ideas of  justice and entitlement. The first major  question regards whether Affirmative Action is simply reparation for past  injustices incurred on American minorities.    Encompassed within this idea is the supportive idea that such policies  correct for imbedded discrimination within institutions, and enables the  identification of a talented workforce among huge groups of people that have  been historically ignored. The converse  sentiment argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination,  which violates the principle of merit that has defined American democracy.         A more comprehensive moral argument claims that  Affirmative Action misclassifies the recipients of affirmative action in terms  of race, as opposed to a more relevant variable, such as socioeconomic  background. This argument also implies  that such policies fail to address the underlying racism/sexism at the root of  the social imbalance.        Empirical claims about Affirmative Action generally exist  in response to two overarching questions: what is the underlying cause of the  inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem. In terms of cause, it is questioned whether  the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of some innate  biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely social  construct. While various studies have  largely disproved the idea of biological predisposition, the unpopular theory  remains debated, especially with regards to a gender disparity in mathematical  and scientific ability.        Less conclusive studies have been instituted in attempt to  answer questions regarding the social and economic efficiency of affirmative  action policies. For instance, have the affirmative  action policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the  targeted minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon?               Public Opinion               The  issue of affirmative action has not ceased to remain a hot issue with the  public. Opinions vary widely based on  race, gender and economics, and there is no clear consensus on the topic. Overall support for affirmative action  remains slightly above 50% as being considered good for the country, with a  trend leading it from 54% in 1995 to 62% in 2000 and finally 58% in 2001.  [29]   While this support, particularly in 2000, is  not completely split, it does not lead to any decisive stance. Furthermore, different polls, such as one  done by The Washington Post , would show vast differences, such as  approximately 75% opposing affirmative action programs for both minorities and  women.  [30]         When  the issue is divided further there is also fluctuation in support. In 2001, 56% supported affirmative action  programs in regards to college admissions, while 58% supported programs for  minorities and women in regards to job hiring.  [31]   While, this is only a 2% difference, it must  be noted that there is a difference between the two. They are not the same to the public.       Furthermore,  support for programs for women is higher than that for racial minorities. In 2005, 59% were in favor of programs for  women, while only 50% favored those for racial minorities. This is preceded by similar differences in  2003 and 2001.  [32]   Affirmative Action programs for women also  held much higher support when first instituted.    In polls taken in 1995, support shows 85% in favor of having had  programs implemented, while only 49% said they were still needed. However, support has raised to 56% in favor  of programs being needed today when the same poll was administered in 2001.  [33]   This would leave the issue of affirmative  action for women as relatively supported overall; however, a different poll from  1995 showed two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men against programs for  women.  [34]         When  looking at where the different opinions are coming from, there is also a large  variation. Two-thirds of blacks (67%)  but only 36% of whites a 31 percentage-point gap feel that the government  should make every effort to help blacks and other minorities.  Gallup   finds blacks and whites' opinions diverge markedly on questions about policy  preferences and the government's role in addressing racial inequality.  [35]   There is an even greater difference when  looking at a CBS News/N.Y. Times poll, showing 94% of blacks believing  affirmative action programs should be continued, with only 47% of whites  favoring affirmative action. Furthermore,  only 3% of blacks believed programs should be abolished, while 42% of whites  supported abolishing affirmative action programs.  [36]         In  a specific example given of two equally qualified students (one black and one  white) who are applying to the same major university, 47% of Americans said the  students would have an equal chance of being admitted, while 29% said the white  student had a better chance and 20% said the black student. When broken down into what opinions came from  which persons, there is an even more remarkable difference. Fifty percent of non-Hispanic whites said  students have an equal chance, 24% said the black student would have a better  chance, and 21% were in favor of the white student. However, 64% of blacks said the white student  would have a better chance and only 4% said the black student would have a  better chance.  [37]   Regardless, there is a clear consensus that  diversity within colleges is important, 89% of blacks and 78% of whites  favoring it.  [38]         There  is certainly a belief that those who are receiving benefits from affirmative  action are not earning them. A slight  majority (47.6%) believe affirmative action programs are giving preferential  treatment to minorities in school admissions and job hirings even when those  minorities are less qualified than other applicants.  [39]   Preferences stigmatize [minorities] as less  able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they  need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch  away.  [40]   Therefore, while the special treatment may be  helping some, it is leaving a devastating stigma along with the benefits. According to Jeff Jacoby of The Boston  Globe when writing in regards to special awards for minorities only,  Blacks and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome...if only they could be  liberated from the condescending mind-set that thinks it's a compliment to tell  a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  [41]           Finally,  the nation is split into approximate thirds in both 1995 and 2001 when asked if  we should increase, keep the same, or decrease affirmative action programs,  leaving no obvious path for the future of affirmative action in public opinion.  [42]   In political terms, this then leaves a  position on this issue as potentially volatile.    According to David Bositis of the Joint Center   for Political and Economic Studies, Hispanics support affirmative action as  much as blacks do. Even in terms of  suburban whites, [politicians] have to worry...  [43]   Thus, there is a constant risk of alienating  conservatives voters in order to gain minority votes, and as can be seen by the  preceding polls, support varies greatly by both those polling and being polled.      International               Worldwide, policies regarding  race, ethnicity and gender equality in education and employment vary from  strict private-sector quotas that demand minority consideration, to  constitutional laws deeming the same considerations illegal. The most distinctive historically class-based  societies, such as South Africa ,   China and India , have imposed stringent  measures to jumpstart a movement toward equality of minorities.  India , with particularly deep  rooted ethnic barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all  major universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople,  former untouchables and - the latest addition - the Other Backward Classes.  [44]    Although such measures have been met with considerable opposition, the  prevailing opinion is that they are crucial both socially to compensate for  centuries of discrimination, and economically to ensure a continued supply of  business talent within the country. The  success of public sector policies will later dictate the need for similar  quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian Muslim  minority groups.  China s existing quotas for its  Non-Han ethnic minorities in the National Assembly have recently been  supplemented with a temporary exclusion from the 1-child policy for the  Non-Han, which constitute 9% of the population.    Similar quota policies have been exhibited in Macedonia   for their Albanian minority, in Malaysia s  Bumiputra quotas for the Malay Population,    and in Brazil   for Native Brazilians, the poor, and the disabled.         The opposite extreme is seen in  several nations that have actively discouraged or dismissed all racial  preference policies. For example, in  October 2005, Slovakia   passed legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional,  following several unsuccessful years of temporary balancing strategies to  integrate the Slovak Roma population.  [45]    In Japan ,  admission to all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance  exam score, which excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.        In much of the world, however, the national  programs for minority clearly resemble those of the United States . Specific or temporary policies are seen in  many countries, like Greece s  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealand s  University Admissions and scholarship preferences for Maori/Polynesian  minorities, and the United Kingdom s 1998 Good Friday  Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force. Interestingly, some of the most progressive  programs are seen in South   Africa , a country notorious for its history  of violent and convoluted discrimination.    In the Employment Equity Act of 1998  [46]  ,   South Africa   instituted measures to repeal discriminatory laws, promote private-sector  diversity, and investigate the causes and depth of Apartheid-driven and other  inequalities. The act acknowledges  women,  aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, and persons with  disabilities as disadvantaged minority groups, and encourages public and  private sector employers to create and implement realistic plans to increase  diversity over time, while simultaneously assisting in the development of  employee unions and collective bargaining organizations to protect employee  rights.  From an  international viewpoint, Affirmative Action is most often instituted in racial,  ethnic, religious, and gender quotas within public education and civil  services. The most distinctive  historically class-based societies, such as South Africa, China and India, have  imposed stringent measures to promote equal representation of minorities. India, with particularly deep rooted ethnic  barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all major  universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople, former  untouchables and - the latest addition - the &quot;Other Backward Classes.&quot;  (1) Although such measures have been met  with considerable opposition, the prevailing opinion is that they are necessary  to reverse centuries of discrimination, as well as to ensure a continued supply  of business talent within the country.    The success of public sector policies will later determine the need for  similar quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian  Muslim minority groups. Chinas quotas  for Non-Han in the National Assembly have been supplemented with a temporary  exclusion from the 1-child policy for the Non-Han ethnicities, which constitute  9% of the population. In its Employment  Equity Act of 1998, South Africa has taken progressive measures to repeal  discriminatory laws, promote private-sector diversity, and investigate the  causes and depth of Apartheid-driven inequality. (2) Similar quota policies have been exhibited in  Macedonia for their Albanian minority, and in Brazil for Native Brazilians, the  poor, and the disabled.        More specific policies are prevalent  throughout Europe, with Greeces  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealands University Admissions and scholarship  preferences for Maori/Polynesian minorities, the United Kingdoms 1998 Good  Friday Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force, and Malaysias  Bumiputra laws for the Malay Population.    The Affirmative Action policies of Indonesia, Germany, and Belgium, most  clearly mimic those of the United States, where despite having no specific  levels, minorities are often granted employment or university preference with  lesser qualifications.        In contrast, several nations have  actively discouraged and dismissed all racial preference policies. For example, in October 2005, Slovakia passed  legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional, following  several years of temporary balancing strategies to integrate the Slovak Roma  population. (3) In Japan, admission to  all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance exam score, which  excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.       Conclusion               Affirmative Action is as hard an  issue to define as it is to implement.    One must remember that Affirmative Action is an imperfect  solution to an underlying problem , a problem  that is usually not addressed by either side of the issue. In order for Affirmative Action programs to  be successful, racism and sexism must first be addressed. Furthermore, issues of who benefits from the  programs must be refined so as to ensure the proper candidates are being  aided. It would be politically  beneficial to support the use of Affirmative Action programs, while  acknowledging their flaws. A focus on  changes in public education and a balancing of the distribution of wealth is  necessary to address these flaws.

Current alumni are now working at MDRC, the Center on School Effectiveness and Inequality at MIT, Teach for America, the Research and Policy Support Group at the NYC Department of Education, and Graduate NYC!, a research foundation of CUNY.    Read more about some of our recent alumni:         Catherine Corbin       Graduation Date : 2011    Undergraduate Institution: University of California, Santa Barbara, Psychology, Minor: English    Current Job : Technical Analyst in K-12 Education, MDRC    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : While in college, I worked for two after-school programs. One was in a well-funded suburban district in CA, and one was in a low-income district. After college I worked as a special education instructional assistant for just under a year before entering EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? It is difficult to choose just one influential project. Capstone was a wonderful experience that pushed me both academically and personally. Our Capstone project allowed us to delve more deeply into an issue of our choosing while demanding high-level quantitative and analytic solutions and understanding. Working with Meryle Weinstein through this process was phenomenal. Meryle&rsquo;s wealth of relevant policy and methodological knowledge was an outstanding resource to have at our disposal. Working with professors such as Leanna Stiefel and Sean Corcoran also proved to be a challenging and inspirational experience. Both Stiefel and Corcoran come from an Economic background, providing a unique and thrilling lens through which to view and study US Education policy.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? My experience in the Education and Social Policy program was extremely fulfilling. It is hard to find a graduate program in which your voice (and face) will be a familiar one amongst professors directly involved in the program&rsquo;s development. The flexibility in the coursework is also something that I look back on as a wildly beneficial aspect of the program. There are so many frameworks through which you can study education and EDSP exposes you to several, the emphasis being on quantitative methods, and then leaves you the freedom of being able to choose three classes that you can effectively build a specialization with. For those looking for an education policy program built upon a strong foundation in quantitative methods, I highly recommend Education and Social Policy.          Annice Correia       Graduation Date : Summer 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Providence College, Social Science; Public and Community Service Studies minor    Current Job : Program Manager at MIT&rsquo;s School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative    First Job After Graduating the EDSP Program : Operations Analyst at NYC Department of Education    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Case Manager at the Empowerment Program in Denver, CO Voting Rights Coordinator at Colorado Common Cause in Denver, CO Substitute Teacher and Track &amp; Field Coach at Old Rochester Regional School District in Mattapoisett, MA Graduate Student Coordinator at NYU EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? While all of my classes were quite formative and valuable, the most influential courses were Multiple Regression with Leanna Stiefel and Large Data Sets in Education with Sean Corcoran. These rigorous classes introduced me to a new level of quantitative analysis, and I am discovering that such skills are vitally important now that I am working in the field.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I was drawn to the highly structured nature of the program. I also enjoyed the freedom in selecting electives from any NYU school. I took electives from Wagner, Steinhardt, and Silver, allowing me to explore a range of interests as they relate to education policy.          Matthew Harrington       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: Johnson &amp; Wales University, Hospitality Management    Current Job : The New American Academy Charter School, Director of Operations    Previous Work Experience : Project Manager/Business Analyst &ndash; Brooksby Village Retirement Community    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Of all my Professors and projects, Dr. Colleen Larson was the most influential. She was a masterful teacher and had a unique ability to inspire and educate her students. I found her approach so genuine and impactful and she made me truly appreciate qualitative inquiry. I found in graduate school that quantitative research takes top billing. Dr. Larson appreciates the quantitative approach, however, she stresses the importance of context and meaning making in research. She taught me that &ldquo;there is no there there&rdquo; and it is a lesson that I will cherish throughout my career.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP Program? My decision to attend the EDSP program was two-fold. First, the phone call I received from Dr. Corcoran made my decision much easier and made me confident in the idea that I would be joining a small, tight knit program that worked closely with students. I felt as if I was not just going to be a faceless student but rather, I cherished the opportunity to work intimately with my professors and other students.    Secondly, I found the opportunity to be in New York City a desirable one. Unlike other secluded college campuses, NYU, by its very nature, forces interaction and chance encounters due to the demographics of the city. I am a very big believer that success is often dictated by ones willingness to expose oneself to randomness. New York City offered this exposure.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Form bonds/relationships with other classmates early. NYU and the EDSP program can be overwhelming at times. Given that the program is so geared towards statistics, it is very beneficial to be able to call/email other classmates and discuss problems that you get stuck on. The EDSP program is challenging and it was wonderful to collaborate with other classmates and work on solving problems together.          Marissa Hiruma       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: New York University, Major in Economics, Minor in Sociology    Current Job : Program Manager of Education, Graduate Medical Education, NYU School of Medicine    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? My Qualitative Inquiry course was a surprise, and developed in me an incredible interest in qualitative data and analysis. The &ldquo;fieldwork&rdquo; experience was incredibly enlightening. The course provided me with a method by which I could more seamlessly bridge my policy coursework with my quantitative analysis coursework. Professor Bryfman was phenomenal, which of course helped!    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Get as much experience working with large data sets as possible. If I could go back, I definitely would have sought relevant internship experience concurrent to coursework. NYC is an incredible place to learn as a student and a citizen, so to enroll in EDSP and have the city and all of its resources available to you is an incredible and unique opportunity. Take advantage!          Dongmo Li       Graduation Date : May 2013    Undergraduate Institution: Heilongjiang University, Major in Editing and Publishing    Current Job : Sesame Workshop (Shanghai Office), Education Content Specialist    Description of Current Position : The specialist works in close association with the producers to ensure that writers develop scripts that cover a range of curricular areas. The specialist also graphs the content areas depicted so that there is a good record of the educational content presented on the series. In addition, the specialist supports the Director of ERO in other project areas related to administration or educational content, such as creating content guidelines, communicating with advisors, and communicating with Sesame Workshop New York.    Previous Work Experience : Part-time teacher, New Oriental Education and Technology Group Inc    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Professor Leanna Stiefel    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? To obtain both qualitative and quantitative research skills to apply to education issues.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Besides the mandatory courses, the optional course can be very helpful to your study and career too. It&rsquo;s important to know your research interest and to tailor your own study in a smart way.          Mengwei Luo       Graduation Date : May 2013    Undergraduate Institution: University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Major in Public Administration    Current Job : NYC Human Resource Administration, City Research Scientist II / Project Manager    Previous Work Experience : HR Consulting Intern at Shanghai All-Ways Business Consulting Co. Ltd.; Internships while I was in EDSP Program: &bull; Data Analyst at The Steinhardt Institute of Higher Education Policy. &bull; Policy Intern at Manhattan Borough President&rsquo;s Office. &bull; Labor Market Analyst Intern at Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. &bull; Adjunct Chinese Language Assistant at Department of East Asian Studies, NYU    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? I appreciated all professors that I have worked with. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Leanna Stiefel, Professor Sean Corcoran, Professor Meryle Weinstein, and Professor Jodi Paroff. They inspired me to explore different fields, helped me find my own interests and strengths, and encouraged me to surmount difficulties. I could not succeed without them.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? I chose EDSP because of its strong emphasis on quantitative analysis. The rigorous analytical courses, such as Econometrics and Applied Statistics, were very appealing to me.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I found courses at NYU very formative and valuable. Treat them seriously and learn as much as possible. Also, take advantage of the location. NYC offers a large number of opportunities for you to apply what you have learnt to the real world..          Nekisha Robertson       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Rutgers University, Major in English    Current Job : Director of Special Projects at Newark Legacy Charter School    First Job after Graduating EDSP Program : Director of Special Projects at Newark Legacy Charter School    Previous Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Office Manager at KIPP Academy Elementary School, Communications Coordinator at Phillips Van- Heusen          Corey Savage       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: University of Massachusetts, Major in Psychology/Biology    Current Job : Doctoral Student at Michigan State University    Description of Current Position : I am beginning a doctoral program in educational policy at MSU with a focus in economics of education. My research interests have to do with teacher labor markets, including recruiting, teacher education, retainment, incentives, evaluation, the role of standardized testing on such issues, and the impact these issues have on student achievement and career readiness.    Who was the most influential professor that you worked with? : Sean Corcoran was and still is a great mentor. Given our mutual research interests, we discussed many issues during the program, and he gave me a great deal of advice when considering doctoral programs.    Jennifer Hill is also a brilliant statistician, and she is very helpful outside the classroom. I seriously urge everyone to take any course she teaches.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? : I liked the heavy quantitative focus, and being in the heart of NYC is a great place to be for aspiring education policy professionals and academics.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? :Be sure to take Jennifer Hill's course (causal inference) and others if you have space in your schedule. Also, be sure to give a lot of thought to your elective courses. Finally, get as much exposure into different realms of education policy as possible during your program through internships (think tanks, policy institutes, charter networks, academia, etc.)          Lianna Wright                           Faculty, Staff, and Graduating Students, December 2012             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

The Center was founded in 2002 with support from the National Science Foundation, and continues to receive funding from various sources (mainly NSF) for continued research on children&rsquo;s developmental transitions in cultural context. The activities of the Center are organized around two large, complementary projects: studies on early childhood (from infancy through age 6 years) and studies on middle childhood and adolescence (from middle school through high school). These two projects are directed by leading scholars in developmental and community psychology, who provide expertise across contexts, developmental stages, and research methodologies. Dozens of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students have participted in the work of the CRCDE and have gone on to pursue further graduate training and recognized careers in psychology and related fields. Center members have published highly acclaimed work on infant and pre-schoolers&rsquo; learning, language, cognitive development, social competence, and emotion and self regulation; children and adolescents&rsquo; school performance, academic achievement, peer relations, and concepts of self; the roles of families, schools, peers, media, workplace, social policies, and culture on the developmental trajectories of young children and youth. This research and related outreach efforts are conducted in continued collaboration and partnerships with hospitals, school systems, and community agencies throughout New York City and beyond. Scientific Mission To accomplish this mission we seek to examine: trajectories of children&#39;s social, emotional, and cognitive development, particularly as children undergo major developmental and social transitions, such as the onset of language and literacy, starting of school, and entry into middle- and high-school children&#39;s experiences in home and school settings, and intersections among different experiences in the two settings the ways in which home and school settings jointly and interactively influence children&#39;s social, emotional, and cognitive development For each aim, we explore ethnic and gender differences in children&#39;s developmental trajectories, home and school experiences, and the intersections between these, with a focus on the ways in which beliefs and practices within cultural communities shape these processes.  Educational Mission      The educational mission of the Center is to      transmit research findings, through training and dissemination,      to three communities:       A new generation of scholars from diverse       backgrounds who are engaged in research on culture and its       role in child learning, engagement, and performance.

{"detail": [{"content": "Why is Affirmative Action such a Divisive Issue                                               Why is Affirmative Action  such a Divisive Issue?         Affirmative  action is one of the most controversial and divisive issues in America .  Those adverse to it argue that by definition, affirmative action programs are  wholly opposed to the American ideals of personal rights; while those in  support of it feel it is necessary for equality. In order to even begin to  understand the rationale behind affirmative action, it is important to first  define the program's intentions and the premise by which it was founded. Affirmative action proponents propose that  the purpose and logic behind affirmative action is not reverse discrimination  or compensation for years of slavery and oppression. Nor is it government  sanctioned racism, sexism or a rejection of American principles. Instead, it is  argued that the consideration of race or gender, particularly on college  campuses, as one of many deciding factors in admissions processes is an attempt  to create the optimal educational experience for everyone. The implementation  of affirmative action programs on college campuses is said to enhance the  learning environment for all students by allowing for an atmosphere of  diversity, in terms of background and point of view. Most importantly, policies that adjust  admissions processes for minorities attempt to compensate for deeply seeded and  complex social problems. While a system of meritocracy is ideal, it is simply  not practical. In America ,  all are not born on an equal playing field.        The  reasons for such an imbalanced landscape of opportunity are wide and  complicated, ranging from the environments in which many minorities grow up,  varying from family life to educational experience, to household income. The  complex backgrounds of different ethnic groups are integral to understanding why  some feel the need for affirmative action. Yet and still, those opposed to  affirmative action try to separate these ideas. It is dangerously nave and  shortsighted to demarcate race from socio-economic status because the two are  so often intertwined. To grow up white  is to be a part of a family that earns a median income of over $44,000 a year,  but to be born into either a black or Hispanic family means a median family  income of just over $24,000 and $33,000, respectively.  [1]    Furthermore, African American or Hispanic workers, making up 13.8 percent and  11.1 percent of the total labor force, are represented by only 6.5 percent, for  African Americans, and 5 percent, for Hispanics, in the upper management of  corporate America .  Similar statistics on whites show the 69.9 percent of the labor force made up  by Caucasians are represented by 84.5 percent at the executive level.         Another unfortunate statistic,  which highlights the painful racial divide in America , is the percentages of  children, under the age of 18, who live in poverty. According to one study,  10.5 percent of white children live in poverty, while 29 percent of Hispanic  kids and 33 percent of African American youths live below poverty lines.  [2]                 Minorities  fall considerably behind their white counterparts in many categories when it  comes to economic standings, but the implications of such financial disparities  are most evident in the access to superior education whites have compared to  minorities. Mean SAT scores reflect the most fundamental failings of the  public education systems attempt to address the rift between races with whites  and blacks earning marks of 1060 and 857, respectively, a full 200 point  difference.  [3]         In the employment context, not all employers are  required to implement an affirmative action program, generally government  entities and federal contractors.  [4]  In cases where the  employer is required to implement an affirmative action program in employment,  the organization must compare the incumbency of females and minorities performing  specific jobs to the availability of those groups in the recruitment area where  the employer finds its employees. Where the employment incumbency in that job  group is less than 80% of the availability of that group, the organization must  establish an affirmative action goal.  [5]  Thus, when there is a job  opening for that particular job group, the organization must take strides to  recruit qualified members of whatever group is underutilized, minorities or  females. However, once the applicants apply, in theory the organization is  required to select the most qualified candidate and cannot make employment  decisions based on race or sex even where there is an affirmative action goal.    [6]  Critics of corporate  affirmative action programs argue that it can be nearly impossible to determine  in the end whether race or gender was used as a final consideration for  employment resulting again in qualified applicants potentially being  discriminated against solely because of their race or gender.  [7]          Affirmative  action has arguably been more effective in its struggle for gender equality  than it has in ending race disparities; with women comprising more high ranking  positions in corporate settings such as that of business and politics than was  the case just 30 years ago. Yet affirmative action poses a great limitation in  that it fails to recognize the intersections of gender, race, and class. Hence,  while as a gender women have progressed dramatically since much earlier times,  closer analysis reveals that women of color (particularly Blacks and  Hispanics), do not comprise much of this progress. Black women especially are  often overlooked in analyses of the impact or effectiveness of affirmative  action and, even more importantly, in the development of policies and programs  that work against systemic social hierarchies.  [8]    This neglect poses a detriment to affirmative action as it prohibits our  culture from tackling the conflicting ways by which gender, race and class  structure our society.  [9]        Historical        //Also needs more balance with women?           Originally, civil rights programs were  constructed to help African Americans become full citizens of the United States .  This was first written in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. The 13th  Amendment makes slavery illegal, the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection  under the law, and finally the 15th Amendment, &quot;forbids racial  discrimination in access to voting.  [10]    However, these amendments were not enough to actually ensure minorities  equality or the right to vote. The southern states  used a variety of techniques of discrimination including literacy tests,  intimidation, violence, and poll taxes.  [11]    In order to achieve equality in all areas of society more had to be done. In 1986, the Supreme Courts decision in Plessy  v. Ferguson upheld a &quot;separate but equal&quot; doctrine that soon  proved to be anything but equal for minorities. However, in 1954, the Supreme  Court overturned Plessy v. Ferguson in the court decision supporting Brown  v. Board of Education , which stated separate could not be equal. This led  to the first instances of Affirmative Action.  [12]     In March 1961, President John F  Kennedy issued Executive Order 10925, which established the President  ' s  Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Its purpose was to end  discrimination in employment by the government and its contractors. Every  federal contract was required to include the pledge that, &quot;The Contractor  will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because  of race, creed, color, or national origin. The Contractor will take affirmative  action, to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated  during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national  origin.&quot;  [13]    This signified the first time the government called for Affirmative Action with  a mission for &quot;equal opportunity in employment.&quot;  [14]        The Civil Rights Act of 1964  restated and broadened the principle of Affirmative Action. Title VI declared  that &quot;No person in the United   States shall, on the ground of race, color  or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits  of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving  federal financial assistance. However,  within one year President Lyndon B. Johnson in his 1965 commencement address  argued that fairness required more than a commitment to impartial treatment. In  his speech he said, &quot;You do not take a person who, for years, has been  hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race  and then say you are free to compete with all the others, and still just  believe that you have been completely fair.&quot; This set the stage for the  contemporary use of affirmative action.  [15]  Several  months later, President Johnson issued Executive Order 11246, requiring all  government contractors and subcontractors to take affirmative action in order  to expand job opportunities for minorities  [16]  ,  and  ,  in   1967, H h e  amended it to include affirmative action for women.  [17]   President Johnsons order was stated in  language very similar to that of President Kennedys; however, Johnson  abolished Kennedys Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity and transferred  responsibilities to the Secretary of Labor, authorizing the Secretary to  &quot;adopt such rules and regulation and issue such order as he deems  necessary and appropriate to achieve purposes thereof.&quot;  [18]          It is crucial  to  in   keep in mind that  a  A ffirmative action  is not solely benefiting race differences but gender as well. In preventing  gender discrimination and providing equal opportunities for all sexes, Title IX  has been put in place. Title IX of the education amendments of 1972 prohibits  sex discrimination in all education institutions that receive federal funding.  Title IX refers to both employment and admission of students. Violations of  this Title result in withdraw of federal funds or suits by private individuals.  Regulations under Title IX allow affirmative action in instances  cases  in which  members of one sex must be treated differently to overcome the specific effects  of past discrimination.  [19]      At this point in American  history, American law and policy was set against racial discrimination in  workplaces, schoolrooms and public accommodations, as well as in housing and  voting. In recent history, two landmark cases have been Grutter v. Bollinger   and Gratz v. Bollinger . In Grutter v. Bollinger the Supreme Court  under Justice OConnor supported the University of Michigan Law Schools  affirmative action program, specifically endorsing Justice Powells view in  1978s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke that student  body diversity is a compelling state interest that can justify using race in  University admissions.  [20]    The Supreme Court thus resolved a split among the lower courts as to Bakkes  value as binding precedent. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gratz v. Bollinger   upheld the value of student body diversity but decided the use of race in University of Michigan undergraduate schools  affirmative action program was not narrowly tailored to achieve the  universitys asserted interest in diversity. The undergraduate program used a  system that assigned points for certain factors such as geography,  legacy/alumni relationships, and race, while the law school took a more  holistic approach. However, in a  reaction to the Supreme Courts decision in Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter  v. Bollinger , University of California Regent Ward Connerly announced his  intention to launch a white initiative to prohibit affirmative action in  education, employment and contracting, which resulted in ending the use of  affirmative action in higher education, public contracting and hiring in  California and Washington State.  [21]          Moral and  Empirical Claims        When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem, as compared their  intended outcomes?        The moral debate tends to center around two major  concepts. The first idea being that  Affirmative Action is reparation for past injustices incurred on American  minorities, and the extent to which reparations are appropriate or  beneficial. For example, the official  position of the American Civil Liberties Union is that affirmative action is a  valuable instrument for leveling what has long been an uneven playing field.  [22]   This The second dominant moral sentiment  argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination where the  inequality is shifted rather than combated, and consequentially violates the  principle of merit that has defined American democracy. The ACLU maintains that affirmative action  merely enables people who might otherwise be shut out, to get their foot in  the door  [23]    and denies that this adversely affects the majority-group applicants. Stanley  Clarke,  Dean of the College   of liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois   at Chicago  summed up  the opposition, when he suggested that  &quot;whites once set  themselves apart from blacks and claimed privileges for themselves while  denying them to others. Now, on the  basis of race, blacks are claiming special status and reserving for themselves  privileges they deny to others. Isn't one as bad as the other? The answer is  no.&quot;   [24]         Empirical claims about  a ffirmative  a ction  generally exist in response to two overarching questions: what is the  underlying cause of the inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action  policies, and what effect have these policies displayed in solving the core  problem. In terms of cause, it is  questioned whether the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of  some innate biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely  social construct. While there is  extensive empirical data, both supporting and refuting the notion of a  race-specific genetic advantage, the controversy that ensues over the  socio-political stigma embedded in the issue often clouds the credibility of  the science involved. The primary  example of such data is the 1994 book The  Bell Curve , which concluded that African Americans have inherently lower  IQs than their white counterparts, and that this discrepancy cannot be  attributed to societal factors. A more  recent study involving Ashkenazi Jews asserts that the  high IQ test  scores of Askenazim, along with their unusual pattern of abilities, are a  product of natural selection, stemming from their occupation of an unusual  social niche.  [25]   Both studies, and their research methods, have  been hotly refuted and defended, leaving them widely inconclusive. The converse  claim attributes the cause of the current racial inequality to prevailing  social policies, attitudes, and racism.    In his 1992 article &quot;Race  and the Schooling of Black Americ  ans,&quot;   Claude Steele makes the argument that the achievement of black students relies  heavily on societal encouragement, and suffers in the face of racism.        The reactionary response to  a ffirmative  action policies seek to measure their  social and economic  efficiency.  . For instance, have the affirmative action  policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the targeted  minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon? A study published in the International Labor Relations Review addressed these issues and  concluded that:         Affirmative Action increases the number of  recruitment and screening practices used by employers, raises employers'  willingness to hire stigmatized applicants, increases the number of minority or  female applicants as well as employees, and increases employers' tendencies to  provide training and formally evaluate employees. When Affirmative Action is  used in recruiting, it generally does not lead to lower credentials or  performance of women and minorities hired.      [26]               A similar 2005 study of affirmative action policies  at three elite universities concluded that  Eliminating affirmative action would significantly  reduce the number of African-Americans and Hispanics admitted to elite  universities, with little gain for White students.  [27]   An opposing study, however, found that  more black and minority police  officers increase crime rates, but this apparently arises because lower hiring  standards involved in recruiting more minority officers reduces the quality of  both new minority and new nonminority officers. The most adverse effects of  these hiring policies have occurred in the most heavily black populated areas.  [28]   While limited to racial inequality in a  specified line of work, this data seems conceptually dissents with the position  that Affirmative Action policies are generally beneficial.  When  analyzing the moral and empirical facets of the issue surrounding Affirmative  Action, questions of cause or effect tend to arise. For example, what is the underlying cause of  the inequality that is targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem?        The moral debate tends to center around the ideas of  justice and entitlement. The first major  question regards whether Affirmative Action is simply reparation for past  injustices incurred on American minorities.    Encompassed within this idea is the supportive idea that such policies  correct for imbedded discrimination within institutions, and enables the  identification of a talented workforce among huge groups of people that have  been historically ignored. The converse  sentiment argues that Affirmative Action is simply reverse discrimination,  which violates the principle of merit that has defined American democracy.         A more comprehensive moral argument claims that  Affirmative Action misclassifies the recipients of affirmative action in terms  of race, as opposed to a more relevant variable, such as socioeconomic  background. This argument also implies  that such policies fail to address the underlying racism/sexism at the root of  the social imbalance.        Empirical claims about Affirmative Action generally exist  in response to two overarching questions: what is the underlying cause of the  inequalities that are targeted by affirmative action policies, and what effect  have these policies displayed in solving the core problem. In terms of cause, it is questioned whether  the superiority of a race/gender/ethnicity is a result of some innate  biological advantage, or if the existing hierarchy is a purely social  construct. While various studies have  largely disproved the idea of biological predisposition, the unpopular theory  remains debated, especially with regards to a gender disparity in mathematical  and scientific ability.        Less conclusive studies have been instituted in attempt to  answer questions regarding the social and economic efficiency of affirmative  action policies. For instance, have the affirmative  action policies over the past 30 years showed proportional gains for the  targeted minorities in terms of education and employment? And is there a net benefit to the greater  economy by disrupting the meritocracy it was built upon?               Public Opinion               The  issue of affirmative action has not ceased to remain a hot issue with the  public. Opinions vary widely based on  race, gender and economics, and there is no clear consensus on the topic. Overall support for affirmative action  remains slightly above 50% as being considered good for the country, with a  trend leading it from 54% in 1995 to 62% in 2000 and finally 58% in 2001.  [29]   While this support, particularly in 2000, is  not completely split, it does not lead to any decisive stance. Furthermore, different polls, such as one  done by The Washington Post , would show vast differences, such as  approximately 75% opposing affirmative action programs for both minorities and  women.  [30]         When  the issue is divided further there is also fluctuation in support. In 2001, 56% supported affirmative action  programs in regards to college admissions, while 58% supported programs for  minorities and women in regards to job hiring.  [31]   While, this is only a 2% difference, it must  be noted that there is a difference between the two. They are not the same to the public.       Furthermore,  support for programs for women is higher than that for racial minorities. In 2005, 59% were in favor of programs for  women, while only 50% favored those for racial minorities. This is preceded by similar differences in  2003 and 2001.  [32]   Affirmative Action programs for women also  held much higher support when first instituted.    In polls taken in 1995, support shows 85% in favor of having had  programs implemented, while only 49% said they were still needed. However, support has raised to 56% in favor  of programs being needed today when the same poll was administered in 2001.  [33]   This would leave the issue of affirmative  action for women as relatively supported overall; however, a different poll from  1995 showed two-thirds of women and three-fourths of men against programs for  women.  [34]         When  looking at where the different opinions are coming from, there is also a large  variation. Two-thirds of blacks (67%)  but only 36% of whites a 31 percentage-point gap feel that the government  should make every effort to help blacks and other minorities.  Gallup   finds blacks and whites' opinions diverge markedly on questions about policy  preferences and the government's role in addressing racial inequality.  [35]   There is an even greater difference when  looking at a CBS News/N.Y. Times poll, showing 94% of blacks believing  affirmative action programs should be continued, with only 47% of whites  favoring affirmative action. Furthermore,  only 3% of blacks believed programs should be abolished, while 42% of whites  supported abolishing affirmative action programs.  [36]         In  a specific example given of two equally qualified students (one black and one  white) who are applying to the same major university, 47% of Americans said the  students would have an equal chance of being admitted, while 29% said the white  student had a better chance and 20% said the black student. When broken down into what opinions came from  which persons, there is an even more remarkable difference. Fifty percent of non-Hispanic whites said  students have an equal chance, 24% said the black student would have a better  chance, and 21% were in favor of the white student. However, 64% of blacks said the white student  would have a better chance and only 4% said the black student would have a  better chance.  [37]   Regardless, there is a clear consensus that  diversity within colleges is important, 89% of blacks and 78% of whites  favoring it.  [38]         There  is certainly a belief that those who are receiving benefits from affirmative  action are not earning them. A slight  majority (47.6%) believe affirmative action programs are giving preferential  treatment to minorities in school admissions and job hirings even when those  minorities are less qualified than other applicants.  [39]   Preferences stigmatize [minorities] as less  able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they  need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch  away.  [40]   Therefore, while the special treatment may be  helping some, it is leaving a devastating stigma along with the benefits. According to Jeff Jacoby of The Boston  Globe when writing in regards to special awards for minorities only,  Blacks and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome...if only they could be  liberated from the condescending mind-set that thinks it's a compliment to tell  a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  [41]           Finally,  the nation is split into approximate thirds in both 1995 and 2001 when asked if  we should increase, keep the same, or decrease affirmative action programs,  leaving no obvious path for the future of affirmative action in public opinion.  [42]   In political terms, this then leaves a  position on this issue as potentially volatile.    According to David Bositis of the Joint Center   for Political and Economic Studies, Hispanics support affirmative action as  much as blacks do. Even in terms of  suburban whites, [politicians] have to worry...  [43]   Thus, there is a constant risk of alienating  conservatives voters in order to gain minority votes, and as can be seen by the  preceding polls, support varies greatly by both those polling and being polled.      International               Worldwide, policies regarding  race, ethnicity and gender equality in education and employment vary from  strict private-sector quotas that demand minority consideration, to  constitutional laws deeming the same considerations illegal. The most distinctive historically class-based  societies, such as South Africa ,   China and India , have imposed stringent  measures to jumpstart a movement toward equality of minorities.  India , with particularly deep  rooted ethnic barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all  major universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople,  former untouchables and - the latest addition - the Other Backward Classes.  [44]    Although such measures have been met with considerable opposition, the  prevailing opinion is that they are crucial both socially to compensate for  centuries of discrimination, and economically to ensure a continued supply of  business talent within the country. The  success of public sector policies will later dictate the need for similar  quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian Muslim  minority groups.  China s existing quotas for its  Non-Han ethnic minorities in the National Assembly have recently been  supplemented with a temporary exclusion from the 1-child policy for the  Non-Han, which constitute 9% of the population.    Similar quota policies have been exhibited in Macedonia   for their Albanian minority, in Malaysia s  Bumiputra quotas for the Malay Population,    and in Brazil   for Native Brazilians, the poor, and the disabled.         The opposite extreme is seen in  several nations that have actively discouraged or dismissed all racial  preference policies. For example, in  October 2005, Slovakia   passed legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional,  following several unsuccessful years of temporary balancing strategies to  integrate the Slovak Roma population.  [45]    In Japan ,  admission to all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance  exam score, which excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.        In much of the world, however, the national  programs for minority clearly resemble those of the United States . Specific or temporary policies are seen in  many countries, like Greece s  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealand s  University Admissions and scholarship preferences for Maori/Polynesian  minorities, and the United Kingdom s 1998 Good Friday  Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force. Interestingly, some of the most progressive  programs are seen in South   Africa , a country notorious for its history  of violent and convoluted discrimination.    In the Employment Equity Act of 1998  [46]  ,   South Africa   instituted measures to repeal discriminatory laws, promote private-sector  diversity, and investigate the causes and depth of Apartheid-driven and other  inequalities. The act acknowledges  women,  aboriginal peoples, members of visible minorities, and persons with  disabilities as disadvantaged minority groups, and encourages public and  private sector employers to create and implement realistic plans to increase  diversity over time, while simultaneously assisting in the development of  employee unions and collective bargaining organizations to protect employee  rights.  From an  international viewpoint, Affirmative Action is most often instituted in racial,  ethnic, religious, and gender quotas within public education and civil  services. The most distinctive  historically class-based societies, such as South Africa, China and India, have  imposed stringent measures to promote equal representation of minorities. India, with particularly deep rooted ethnic  barriers, is in the midst of legislation that will require all major  universities to reserve their second seat for indigenous tribespeople, former  untouchables and - the latest addition - the &quot;Other Backward Classes.&quot;  (1) Although such measures have been met  with considerable opposition, the prevailing opinion is that they are necessary  to reverse centuries of discrimination, as well as to ensure a continued supply  of business talent within the country.    The success of public sector policies will later determine the need for  similar quotas in the private sector, which are already in the works for Indian  Muslim minority groups. Chinas quotas  for Non-Han in the National Assembly have been supplemented with a temporary  exclusion from the 1-child policy for the Non-Han ethnicities, which constitute  9% of the population. In its Employment  Equity Act of 1998, South Africa has taken progressive measures to repeal  discriminatory laws, promote private-sector diversity, and investigate the  causes and depth of Apartheid-driven inequality. (2) Similar quota policies have been exhibited in  Macedonia for their Albanian minority, and in Brazil for Native Brazilians, the  poor, and the disabled.        More specific policies are prevalent  throughout Europe, with Greeces  lowered election limits for female  candidates in government, New Zealands University Admissions and scholarship  preferences for Maori/Polynesian minorities, the United Kingdoms 1998 Good  Friday Agreement for religious equality in the Police Force, and Malaysias  Bumiputra laws for the Malay Population.    The Affirmative Action policies of Indonesia, Germany, and Belgium, most  clearly mimic those of the United States, where despite having no specific  levels, minorities are often granted employment or university preference with  lesser qualifications.        In contrast, several nations have  actively discouraged and dismissed all racial preference policies. For example, in October 2005, Slovakia passed  legislation deeming all Affirmative Action policies unconstitutional, following  several years of temporary balancing strategies to integrate the Slovak Roma  population. (3) In Japan, admission to  all University and Government positions is decided by an entrance exam score, which  excludes sex, race, and social background identifiers.       Conclusion               Affirmative Action is as hard an  issue to define as it is to implement.    One must remember that Affirmative Action is an imperfect  solution to an underlying problem , a problem  that is usually not addressed by either side of the issue. In order for Affirmative Action programs to  be successful, racism and sexism must first be addressed. Furthermore, issues of who benefits from the  programs must be refined so as to ensure the proper candidates are being  aided. It would be politically  beneficial to support the use of Affirmative Action programs, while  acknowledging their flaws. A focus on  changes in public education and a balancing of the distribution of wealth is  necessary to address these flaws.

Current alumni are now working at MDRC, the Center on School Effectiveness and Inequality at MIT, Teach for America, the Research and Policy Support Group at the NYC Department of Education, and Graduate NYC!, a research foundation of CUNY.    Read more about some of our recent alumni:         Catherine Corbin       Graduation Date : 2011    Undergraduate Institution: University of California, Santa Barbara, Psychology, Minor: English    Current Job : Technical Analyst in K-12 Education, MDRC    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : While in college, I worked for two after-school programs. One was in a well-funded suburban district in CA, and one was in a low-income district. After college I worked as a special education instructional assistant for just under a year before entering EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? It is difficult to choose just one influential project. Capstone was a wonderful experience that pushed me both academically and personally. Our Capstone project allowed us to delve more deeply into an issue of our choosing while demanding high-level quantitative and analytic solutions and understanding. Working with Meryle Weinstein through this process was phenomenal. Meryle&rsquo;s wealth of relevant policy and methodological knowledge was an outstanding resource to have at our disposal. Working with professors such as Leanna Stiefel and Sean Corcoran also proved to be a challenging and inspirational experience. Both Stiefel and Corcoran come from an Economic background, providing a unique and thrilling lens through which to view and study US Education policy.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? My experience in the Education and Social Policy program was extremely fulfilling. It is hard to find a graduate program in which your voice (and face) will be a familiar one amongst professors directly involved in the program&rsquo;s development. The flexibility in the coursework is also something that I look back on as a wildly beneficial aspect of the program. There are so many frameworks through which you can study education and EDSP exposes you to several, the emphasis being on quantitative methods, and then leaves you the freedom of being able to choose three classes that you can effectively build a specialization with. For those looking for an education policy program built upon a strong foundation in quantitative methods, I highly recommend Education and Social Policy.          Annice Correia       Graduation Date : Summer 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Providence College, Social Science; Public and Community Service Studies minor    Current Job : Program Manager at MIT&rsquo;s School Effectiveness and Inequality Initiative    First Job After Graduating the EDSP Program : Operations Analyst at NYC Department of Education    Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Case Manager at the Empowerment Program in Denver, CO Voting Rights Coordinator at Colorado Common Cause in Denver, CO Substitute Teacher and Track &amp; Field Coach at Old Rochester Regional School District in Mattapoisett, MA Graduate Student Coordinator at NYU EDSP    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? While all of my classes were quite formative and valuable, the most influential courses were Multiple Regression with Leanna Stiefel and Large Data Sets in Education with Sean Corcoran. These rigorous classes introduced me to a new level of quantitative analysis, and I am discovering that such skills are vitally important now that I am working in the field.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I was drawn to the highly structured nature of the program. I also enjoyed the freedom in selecting electives from any NYU school. I took electives from Wagner, Steinhardt, and Silver, allowing me to explore a range of interests as they relate to education policy.          Matthew Harrington       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: Johnson &amp; Wales University, Hospitality Management    Current Job : The New American Academy Charter School, Director of Operations    Previous Work Experience : Project Manager/Business Analyst &ndash; Brooksby Village Retirement Community    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Of all my Professors and projects, Dr. Colleen Larson was the most influential. She was a masterful teacher and had a unique ability to inspire and educate her students. I found her approach so genuine and impactful and she made me truly appreciate qualitative inquiry. I found in graduate school that quantitative research takes top billing. Dr. Larson appreciates the quantitative approach, however, she stresses the importance of context and meaning making in research. She taught me that &ldquo;there is no there there&rdquo; and it is a lesson that I will cherish throughout my career.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP Program? My decision to attend the EDSP program was two-fold. First, the phone call I received from Dr. Corcoran made my decision much easier and made me confident in the idea that I would be joining a small, tight knit program that worked closely with students. I felt as if I was not just going to be a faceless student but rather, I cherished the opportunity to work intimately with my professors and other students.    Secondly, I found the opportunity to be in New York City a desirable one. Unlike other secluded college campuses, NYU, by its very nature, forces interaction and chance encounters due to the demographics of the city. I am a very big believer that success is often dictated by ones willingness to expose oneself to randomness. New York City offered this exposure.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Form bonds/relationships with other classmates early. NYU and the EDSP program can be overwhelming at times. Given that the program is so geared towards statistics, it is very beneficial to be able to call/email other classmates and discuss problems that you get stuck on. The EDSP program is challenging and it was wonderful to collaborate with other classmates and work on solving problems together.          Marissa Hiruma       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: New York University, Major in Economics, Minor in Sociology    Current Job : Program Manager of Education, Graduate Medical Education, NYU School of Medicine    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? My Qualitative Inquiry course was a surprise, and developed in me an incredible interest in qualitative data and analysis. The &ldquo;fieldwork&rdquo; experience was incredibly enlightening. The course provided me with a method by which I could more seamlessly bridge my policy coursework with my quantitative analysis coursework. Professor Bryfman was phenomenal, which of course helped!    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Get as much experience working with large data sets as possible. If I could go back, I definitely would have sought relevant internship experience concurrent to coursework. NYC is an incredible place to learn as a student and a citizen, so to enroll in EDSP and have the city and all of its resources available to you is an incredible and unique opportunity. Take advantage!          Dongmo Li       Graduation Date : May 2013    Undergraduate Institution: Heilongjiang University, Major in Editing and Publishing    Current Job : Sesame Workshop (Shanghai Office), Education Content Specialist    Description of Current Position : The specialist works in close association with the producers to ensure that writers develop scripts that cover a range of curricular areas.

Previous Work Experience : Part-time teacher, New Oriental Education and Technology Group Inc    What was the most influential experience or project, OR who was the most influential professor that you worked with? Professor Leanna Stiefel    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? To obtain both qualitative and quantitative research skills to apply to education issues.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? Besides the mandatory courses, the optional course can be very helpful to your study and career too. It&rsquo;s important to know your research interest and to tailor your own study in a smart way.          Mengwei Luo       Graduation Date : May 2013    Undergraduate Institution: University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Major in Public Administration    Current Job : NYC Human Resource Administration, City Research Scientist II / Project Manager    Previous Work Experience : HR Consulting Intern at Shanghai All-Ways Business Consulting Co.

I appreciated all professors that I have worked with. In particular, I would like to thank Professor Leanna Stiefel, Professor Sean Corcoran, Professor Meryle Weinstein, and Professor Jodi Paroff. They inspired me to explore different fields, helped me find my own interests and strengths, and encouraged me to surmount difficulties. I could not succeed without them.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? I chose EDSP because of its strong emphasis on quantitative analysis. The rigorous analytical courses, such as Econometrics and Applied Statistics, were very appealing to me.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? I found courses at NYU very formative and valuable. Treat them seriously and learn as much as possible. Also, take advantage of the location. NYC offers a large number of opportunities for you to apply what you have learnt to the real world..          Nekisha Robertson       Graduation Date : January 2012    Undergraduate Institution: Rutgers University, Major in English    Current Job : Director of Special Projects at Newark Legacy Charter School    First Job after Graduating EDSP Program : Director of Special Projects at Newark Legacy Charter School    Previous Work Experience Before EDSP Program : Office Manager at KIPP Academy Elementary School, Communications Coordinator at Phillips Van- Heusen          Corey Savage       Graduation Date : January 2013    Undergraduate Institution: University of Massachusetts, Major in Psychology/Biology    Current Job : Doctoral Student at Michigan State University    Description of Current Position : I am beginning a doctoral program in educational policy at MSU with a focus in economics of education. My research interests have to do with teacher labor markets, including recruiting, teacher education, retainment, incentives, evaluation, the role of standardized testing on such issues, and the impact these issues have on student achievement and career readiness.    Who was the most influential professor that you worked with? : Sean Corcoran was and still is a great mentor. Given our mutual research interests, we discussed many issues during the program, and he gave me a great deal of advice when considering doctoral programs.    Jennifer Hill is also a brilliant statistician, and she is very helpful outside the classroom. I seriously urge everyone to take any course she teaches.    Why did you choose to attend the EDSP program? : I liked the heavy quantitative focus, and being in the heart of NYC is a great place to be for aspiring education policy professionals and academics.    Do you have any other thoughts you&rsquo;d like to share with prospective students about the program? :Be sure to take Jennifer Hill's course (causal inference) and others if you have space in your schedule. Also, be sure to give a lot of thought to your elective courses. Finally, get as much exposure into different realms of education policy as possible during your program through internships (think tanks, policy institutes, charter networks, academia, etc.)          Lianna Wright                           Faculty, Staff, and Graduating Students, December 2012             This site, and all its contents, are Copyright &copy;    by New York University.

The Center was founded in 2002 with support from the National Science Foundation, and continues to receive funding from various sources (mainly NSF) for continued research on children&rsquo;s developmental transitions in cultural context. The activities of the Center are organized around two large, complementary projects: studies on early childhood (from infancy through age 6 years) and studies on middle childhood and adolescence (from middle school through high school). These two projects are directed by leading scholars in developmental and community psychology, who provide expertise across contexts, developmental stages, and research methodologies. Dozens of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students have participted in the work of the CRCDE and have gone on to pursue further graduate training and recognized careers in psychology and related fields. Center members have published highly acclaimed work on infant and pre-schoolers&rsquo; learning, language, cognitive development, social competence, and emotion and self regulation; children and adolescents&rsquo; school performance, academic achievement, peer relations, and concepts of self; the roles of families, schools, peers, media, workplace, social policies, and culture on the developmental trajectories of young children and youth. This research and related outreach efforts are conducted in continued collaboration and partnerships with hospitals, school systems, and community agencies throughout New York City and beyond. Scientific Mission To accomplish this mission we seek to examine: trajectories of children&#39;s social, emotional, and cognitive development, particularly as children undergo major developmental and social transitions, such as the onset of language and literacy, starting of school, and entry into middle- and high-school children&#39;s experiences in home and school settings, and intersections among different experiences in the two settings the ways in which home and school settings jointly and interactively influence children&#39;s social, emotional, and cognitive development For each aim, we explore ethnic and gender differences in children&#39;s developmental trajectories, home and school experiences, and the intersections between these, with a focus on the ways in which beliefs and practices within cultural communities shape these processes.  Educational Mission      The educational mission of the Center is to      transmit research findings, through training and dissemination,      to three communities:       A new generation of scholars from diverse       backgrounds who are engaged in research on culture and its       role in child learning, engagement, and performance. The broader research community. Policy makers and practitioners in education      (including school administrators and teachers).
