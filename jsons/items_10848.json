Entering graduate students are required to take advisory exams in both areas prior to arrival; placements will be determined by interpreting the exam results in light of a student's educational background and the degree program for which she or he is enrolled. Remedial courses cannot be used to meet degree requirements within any of the graduate programs. It is the responsibility of the student to see that deficiencies are remedied swiftly so as not to impede their progress toward the degree.    About the Advisory Exams:    Who must take them? Advisory exams are required of all entering graduate students in music, including those enrolling directly in Ph.D or Advanced Certificate programs with the following exceptions:       Students who have completed a previous music degree (undergraduate or graduate) within our department in the last five years are exempt from both exams.    Music Business students are exempt from both exams.       When are they given? Students are generally required to take both exams prior to their first semester of study. Postponement of the history exam by one semester will be granted and is recommended for all international students who have not yet passed their English Proficiency Test. Other postponements may be granted in extraordinary circumstances by the Theory Director upon the recommendation of a student's Program Director. The theory and history exams are given throughout each summer and in the week prior to the beginning of the second semester (usually the second week of January). Information about the exact dates, times, and locations for each year may be found at the Graduate Theory and History Placement Exams upcoming test dates page.  What is the format and content of the exams? In music theory and aural skills, students must demonstrate mastery of fundamentals as well as proficiency in part writing, directed analysis of tonal music, and various kinds of dictation (melodic, rhythmic, harmonic). The exam lasts approximately two and a half hours. In music history, students must demonstrate knowledge of the major historical periods, styles, composers and genres throughout the history of Western art music as well as a familiarity with the broad spectrum of music in the twentieth (and twenty-first) century. It consists of a written part and a listening part, lasting in total approximately two and a half hours. The written part involves matching, multiple choice, and short answer. The listening part similarly involves simple identification (via multiple choice) of the periods and composers of prominent works.  How can students prepare for them?    Students can review successfully in a variety of ways. Students with good preparation in their undergraduate programs might review materials and texts from their undergraduate courses. Also recommended are any of the major comprehensive texts in either area. In particular, we recommend the sources below. For theory, either of the following:    Laitz, Steven and Christopher Bartlette. Graduate Review of Tonal Theory: A Recasting of Common Practice Harmony, Form and Counterpoint. (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010).    Aldwell, Edward and Carl Schachter. Harmony and Voice Leading, 3rd ed. (New York: Schirmer, 2002)    For music history, both of the following:    Burkholder, J. Peter, Grout, Donald J. and Claude Palisca. A History of Western Music, 8th ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 2010).    Burkholder, J. Peter, and Claude Palisca. Norton Anthology of Western Music , 6th ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 2010)    The students may also find helpful the following music history review aid:    Poultney, David. Studying Music History: Learning, Reasoning, and Writing about Music History and Literature , 2nd ed. (Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1995)    Do students need to sign up for the exams in advance? No.  May students take the exam more than once? No.  May students take remedial courses instead of the exam, or in preparation for them? No.    About the Remediation:    How is remediation handled? On the basis of the exam results, some students are exempted from all remedial requirements. Many students, however, may be required to take one or more courses in music theory, aural comprehension, and/or music history. The Directory of Music Theory will assign specific course requirements for those students in need of remediation. These requirements must be satisfied prior to graduation. May students write papers or do other independent projects instead of taking the required remedial courses? No.  Who might I speak with for further information?

Our strong and diverse group seeks provable answers to these questions. It focuses on problems and questions in the following areas: computational geometry, computational algebra, randomness (in algorithm design and average case analysis), computational biology, correctness of programs and hardware, and game theory.    Richard Cole has worked on a wide range of algorithmic topics. His current focus is the new area of algorithmic economics. One of the fundamental notions in economics is the concept of equilibrium: for example, prices that approximately balance supply and demand are expected to be the norm. From a computer science perspective, for an equilibrium to be attainable, it has to be computationally feasible to find equilibrium prices and, in addition, the market itself must be able to \"compute\" such prices. Prof. Cole, his collaborators, and students are studying the computational hardness of the pricing problem and specific pricing algorithms for different market and agent models.    Yevgeniy Dodis is primarily interested in cryptography. His current primary research directions are cryptography based on imperfect randomness, exposure-resilient cryptography, cryptography with biometrics and other noisy data, hash functions and random oracle model and information-theoretic cryptography. Recent achievements include design of special purpose randomness extractors for imperfect sources, formal model of cryptography based on noisy data, design and formalization of intrusion-resilient cryptosystems and new criteria and techniques for design of hash functions.    Subhash Khot is broadly interested in all aspects of algorithms and computational complexity. His specific interests include efficiently computing approximate solutions to NP-hard problems and negative results showing that for many problems, even computing approximate solutions is intractable. His recent works include negative results for semi-definite programming based algorithms, their connection to metric geometry and analysis, and negative results for some learning theory problems.    Bud Mishra has worked in many areas of Computer Science. His current focus is on applications of computer science and mathematical ideas to biological sciences. He has developed optical mapping technology, a successful approach to physical genome mapping. He aims to develop efficient practical algorithmic tools for genome mapping and sequencing. He leads a number of projects in bioinformatics, primarily in genomics and systems biology, including a novel technology aimed at making fast and cheap sequencing of the human genome broadly accessible, a cancer genome atlas, algebraic model checking for systems biology, large-scale models of pandemic flu and smallpox and many others.    Mehryar Mohri's primary research areas are machine learning, theory and algorithms, text and speech processing, and computational biology. This includes in particular the study of the theoretical aspects of machine learning, the design of general and accurate learning algorithms, and their applications to large-scale learning problems such as those found in bioinformatics and language processing.    Oded Regev's research is in mathematical aspects of theoretical computer science. He is particularly interested in advancing the area of lattice-based cryptography using concepts from quantum computation, analysis, and number theory.    Victor Shoup 's research areas are cryptography and computational number theory; he is especially interested in the interactions between these two areas. He designs and analyzes cryptographic primitives and protocols with security properties that can be proven based on clear and reasonable assumptions, and which are nevertheless practical enough to use in the real world. Most recently, he has been working on practical secure deniable protocols (i.e., participants in an exchange using this protocol can deny that it ever took place) based on novel and use of number-theoretic algorithms.    Alan Siegel is interested in the analysis of algorithms and related mathematics, which includes applications from probability, statistics, partial and ordinary differential equations and methods in asymptotic analysis. He works on analysis of probabilistic processes and geometric arrangements of lines. His current research focuses on hashing functions and their properties. He is also interested in K-12 mathematics education and new approaches to teaching algorithms at the college and graduate level.    Joel Spencer is interested in applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science. He worked on many topics including Ramsey theory (which studies the conditions under which order must appear in random systems), discrepancy theory (which deals with measuring irregularities of discrete distributions), random graphs and their connections to logic and randomized greedy methods. He is the author of a number of widely known books on probabilistic method.    Chee Yap works in the areas of computational geometry, algebraic computation and visualization. His current research focuses on two themes: exact arithmetic computation and large-scale visualization. Numerical nonrobustness has been called \"computer scientists' dirty secret\" --everyone knows that our numerical software can break, but we rarely talk about it. The most successful approach to solving the robustness problem in geometry is based on exact geometric computation. Chee Yap and his group are developing techniques for this type of computation based on algebraic zero bounds. Exact geometric computation provides considerable insight into the theory of real computation. The other direction of Chee Yap's work is large-scale visualization, dynamic visualization of geospatial data in particular.
