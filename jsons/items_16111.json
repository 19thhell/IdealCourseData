Diversity at NYU has historically been broadly defined, encompassing differences across categories of race and ethnicity, gender, age, ability, political belief, economic status, and sexual orientation. By supporting scholars\u2019 transitions into the professorate, New York University intends to increase the number of faculty who reflect expanding diversity in an increasingly global society. To that end, NYU has created the NYU Postdoctoral and Transition Program for Academic Diversity fellowship program to support promising scholars and educators from different backgrounds, races, ethnic groups, and other under-represented groups whose life experience, research experience, and employment background will contribute significantly to academic excellence at NYU. Fellowships are focused on strong model of mentorship in their participating departments, geared towards maximizing scholarly productivity and professional development.     Eligibility   The fellowship program is open to all areas of study at the University. Individuals who meet one of the following criteria are eligible to apply:     Individuals who have completed their dissertation within the last three years or who will have completed their dissertation by September 1, 2015; or     Professionals transitioning to academic careers (for those in field for which the doctorate is not the terminal degree);     Priority is given to candidates who do not currently hold postdoctoral fellowships or traineeships.       Awards   NYU will award up to five in-residence fellowships in 2015. Appointments are for two years and begin September 2015 and end August 2017. Fellows teach a maximum of one course per semester, participate in school and departmental activities, and have mentorship opportunities to prepare them for an academic career.     Compensation and Allowances   Fellows will be appointed as \u201cAssistant Professor/Faculty Fellow\u201d and will receive a $40,000 nine-month salary; an annual housing allowance ($20,000); a research allowance ($2,000); and reimbursement for one-time relocation fees (up to $3,000). Such compensation will be subject to appropriate taxation. The University also provides a benefits package, including medical and dental coverage.     Application Procedure   Required application materials include (1) a fellowship application; (2) a curriculum vitae; (3) a statement of research, fellowship goals, and identification of one or more programs or mentors that would represent a good fit for the proposed fellowship; (4) a personal statement detailing the reasons for applying for the fellowship; (5) three letters of reference from individuals familiar with your scholarly or creative work; and (6) one of the following: a dissertation abstract (postdoctoral applicants); or a statement of how your professional experience prepares you for a faculty position (professionals). Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.   Fellowship recipients must provide proof of authorization to work in the United States. NYU does not sponsor visa for this Fellowship.

Diversity at NYU has historically been broadly defined, encompassing differences across categories of race and ethnicity, gender, age, ability, political belief, economic status, and sexual orientation. By supporting scholars\u2019 transitions into the professorate, New York University intends to increase the number of faculty who reflect expanding diversity in an increasingly global society. To that end, NYU has created the NYU Postdoctoral and Transition Program for Academic Diversity fellowship program to support promising scholars and educators from different backgrounds, races, ethnic groups, and other under-represented groups whose life experience, research experience, and employment background will contribute significantly to academic excellence at NYU. Fellowships are focused on strong model of mentorship in their participating departments, geared towards maximizing scholarly productivity and professional development.     Eligibility   The fellowship program is open to all areas of study at the University. Individuals who meet one of the following criteria are eligible to apply:     Individuals who have completed their dissertation within the last three years or who will have completed their dissertation by September 1, 2015; or     Professionals transitioning to academic careers (for those in field for which the doctorate is not the terminal degree);     Priority is given to candidates who do not currently hold postdoctoral fellowships or traineeships.       Awards   NYU will award up to five in-residence fellowships in 2015. Appointments are for two years and begin September 2015 and end August 2017. Fellows teach a maximum of one course per semester, participate in school and departmental activities, and have mentorship opportunities to prepare them for an academic career.     Compensation and Allowances   Fellows will be appointed as \u201cAssistant Professor/Faculty Fellow\u201d and will receive a $40,000 nine-month salary; an annual housing allowance ($20,000); a research allowance ($2,000); and reimbursement for one-time relocation fees (up to $3,000). Such compensation will be subject to appropriate taxation. The University also provides a benefits package, including medical and dental coverage.     Application Procedure   Required application materials include (1) a fellowship application; (2) a curriculum vitae; (3) a statement of research, fellowship goals, and identification of one or more programs or mentors that would represent a good fit for the proposed fellowship; (4) a personal statement detailing the reasons for applying for the fellowship; (5) three letters of reference from individuals familiar with your scholarly or creative work; and (6) one of the following: a dissertation abstract (postdoctoral applicants); or a statement of how your professional experience prepares you for a faculty position (professionals). Incomplete submissions will not be accepted.   Fellowship recipients must provide proof of authorization to work in the United States. NYU does not sponsor visa for this Fellowship.
