The faculty at New York University is particularly strong in Economic Theory, Macroeconomics, International Economics, and Economic Growth and Development. Although Economics is a large Department, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also about how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write a research paper as an Honors Thesis under direct faculty supervision.    Academic Programs    The Department offers a major in Economics and joint majors in Economics and Mathematics and in Economics and Computer Science. The details are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin.    The Department's major can be taken in either one of two concentrations, a Theory concentration or, a Policy concentration. The former is for students who desire a more formal approach to economic analysis. The latter is for students who prefer an approach less formal and that emphasize the role of economic institutions and the interplay between policy and theory. Highly motivated students may wish to explore the possibilities of participation in the Department's honors programs, which gives students access to excellent professors in small classes and culminates in the writing of a senior thesis under faculty supervision. Students who plan to go on to advanced degrees in Economics or to law school are strongly encouraged to pursue the Theory concentration, but should consider taking Honors as well. Honors may also be taken in the Policy concentration and eligible students are urged to do so.    Activities and Awards    All students interested in Economics are welcome to join the student-run Undergraduate Economics Society. In the past, the Society has organized a series of guest speakers, visits to local economic institutions, and social activities. The Department also has chapters of two national academic honor societies, Omicron Delta Epsilon and the Honorary Economics Society. The Murray Altman Prize is given to a junior with an outstanding record in Economics and related fields. The Emanuel Stein Memorial Award in Economics goes to a senior for outstanding scholarship in economics.    Career Options    Students majoring in Economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in Economics, business management, or public administration. Pre-professional students will find that an Economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Studying Economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of the urban environment. Students often find internships and eventually career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings.    Admission and Financial Aid    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.

The New Economy: Myth or Reality?         In 1997, the debate on Productivity  Growth in the 1990s took a new twist as data for 1996 and 1997  appeared to show a significant increase in the rate of productivity growth.  For example the latest data for the third quarter of 1997 showed that productivity  was growing at a annualized rate of 4.0% in the business sector and a whopping  9.3% in the manufacturing sector (see the BLS  Web Site for the latest productivity report ). While the annualized  growth rate data might be distorted by a particular good quarter, the actual  quarter-on-quarter annual rates of growth showed similar large increases  of productivity growth: the actual productivity growth between the third  quarter of 1996 and the third quarter of 1997 was 2.4% for the business  sector and 4.6% for the manufacturing sector, well above the dismal rates  of 1.0% observed in the early 1990s. These new data led a number of authors  to argue that we had entered in a new era of sustained productivity growth;  one heard a lot of talk about a \"New Economy\" where a \"New Paradigm\"  of high growth and low inflation holds.              For a critique of the New Economy hypothesis see three  recent articles by Paul Krugman, one on Slate ,  one on Fortune  magazine and the last on the Harvard  Business Review .     The main arguments in favor of the New Economy hypothesis  can be found in an article by Shepard in Business  Week .      Another strong critique of the New Economy has been presented    an article by Alan Blinder ,   a profesor of economics at Princeton and former Fed Vice-Chairman.      The views of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on this debate  are presented in a a speech   he gave in September 1997 and another speech   in October 1997.      The views of another influental Fed Governor, Laurence  Meyer, are presented in a speech   he gave in September 1997. Meyer's views are the subject of a NYT  article .      For another skeptical view on the productivity boom, see  the arguments by Stephen Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley in three  different pieces on Nov  19, 1997 , Aug  1, 1997 , and Aug  5, 1997 and a recent long essay he wrote on    The Boom for  Whom: Revisiting America's Technology Paradox (this latter piece is  in PDF format).      A view   from Stanford economist Robert Hall.         The skeptics argue that the economy's recent good performance  can be explained by temporary factors. Specifically:      The increase in productivity growth in 1996-97 is too  recent to argue that it represents a new long-run trend in productivity;  for example, productivity growth was very modest between 1990 and 1995.  Two good years do not make a trend.      A sharp slowdown in health-care inflation to less than  3% has helped restrain overall inflation and boost corporate earnings.  But medical costs are likely to start rising again.      Worker anxiety has held down wage growth to barely 3%  annually, keeping up profits without raising prices. But tight labor  markets will soon ignite wage inflation.      The soaring dollar has made imports much cheaper since  1995, dampening inflation. But with the dollar stable against major currencies,  import prices may stop falling.      The drop in interest rates since 1990 has pumped up profits  even at inefficient companies. But with rates already low, more such  easy gains will be hard to come by."}]},
