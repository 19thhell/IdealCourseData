The Law and Society minor offers undergraduates a useful and meaningful cluster of courses in this area. Administered through the Department of Sociology, the minor is interdisciplinary in nature. It consists of five courses: one required \u201ccore\u201d course (Law and Society) and four electives. The electives can be taken from a list of approved courses across a range of disciplines. This allows the minor to be both substantial and coherent in its focus. The minor also provides students the opportunity to pursue advanced and specialized work through independent study projects as well as access to graduate classes (with permission of faculty). While prelaw students are welcome to take these classes, the minor is not aimed specifically at them. A list of courses that count toward the Law and Society minor is available every semester through the Sociology Department. Contact Jamie Lloyd ( jamie.lloyd@nyu.edu ) or Professor Lynne Haney ( lynne.haney@nyu.edu ) for a copy of this list or with questions about the minor. To declare a Law &amp; Society minor complete the Declaration of Minor Form .This   form should be mailed or dropped off to Jamie Lloyd at the NYU Department of   Sociology, Puck Building, 295 Lafayette Street, room 4168.
