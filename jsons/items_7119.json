20th Century Thought    Bianchi    19 th and 20 th century continental philosophy,  from German idealism and romanticism, through Marxism, phenomenology,  psychoanalysis, deconstruction, and feminism, has received, retrieved, deployed  and reread the ancient Greeks in a myriad of ways and to a myriad of ends. In this class we will undertake close  readings of ancient texts in their own right, and explore their various  dispersals and appearances in a selection of 19 th and 20 th   century Western philosophical contexts. In so doing we will address methodological issues of retrieval and  reception. What fantasies, aspirations,  and anxieties are at work when modern authors engage classical antiquity? What do ancient references contribute to  modern arguments and to canon formation? How do these encounters help to illuminate the ancient text itself on  the one hand, and the contemporary projects \u2013 whether philosophical, national,  literary, or political \u2013 to which they are put on the other? Themes to be explored include German  nationalism\u2019s romance with ancient Greece; the role of antiquity in Hegelian  and Marxist dialectics; and materialisms ancient and modern. In particular, we will investigate the  impulse to return to the \u201cbirths\u201d of metaphysics, or tragedy, or the question  of Being, or patriarchy, as the \u201clateness\u201d or \u201ccompletion\u201d of modernity is  heralded. We will thereby trace continuities, displacements, breakages and  articulations that have occurred within and between these textual  traditions. Our study of ancient texts  will fall into five broad sections: Presocratics, tragedy (with particular focus on Sophocles\u2019 Antigone),  Plato, Aristotle, and ancient atomism. Modern authors will include Hegel, Marx, H\u00f6lderlin, Nietzsche,  Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida, Ira Gray, Althusser, Sch\u00fcrmann, and Butler.   Literature, History and Politics: Reading the Global South: Uneven Development, Critical Geography, &amp; Anti-Imperial Thinking    Dopico    This course seeks to create a  comparative ground for cultural politics typically separated by language,  imperial histories, and neo-colonial maps. It takes up the cultural, political, historical and theoretical  consequences and critiques of uneven development as an enduring truth of the  global order. It engages the politics  and economies of imperialism and the history and theory of  anti-imperialism. We will consider the  idea of the Global South as a topography of uneven development and uneven  temporalities, where notions of modernity and periphery are affirmed and  contested and where the names and practices of resistance, rebellion, and  critique continue to engage not only metropolitan centers but the force of the  state. The course looks beyond \u201carea  studies\u201d definitions and seeks a  materialist and critical geography, turning toward a hemispheric Southern  critique that challenged empire, globalization,  democratization, neoliberalism and permanent warfare long before the current  political moment. We will trace the  political and critical genealogies, the disciplinary canonizations, and the popular life of an indispensable contestatory  archive\u2014an archive whose long history helps to contextualize and demystify the  geopolitics of the present, as well as the politics of the academy. The course is in part designed to comparatists  and students of varied fields an interdisciplinary and historical knowledge of  texts whose messy political engagements and materialist foundations have lately  been rather marginalized by a reaffirmation of theoretical universals. We will consider how old ideological  mappings like third world,  underdevelopment, revolution survive and how old imperial and cold wars haunt  new politics and geopolitical destinies. The course traces themes and variations of a global anti-imperialism,  its constituencies, and its critical strategies; it stresses how these  contestatory narratives have irrevocably altered the cultural politics and  cultural markets of international metropoli and international policy. It seeks also to distinguish \u201csouthern\u201d  contexts for struggles around feminism, race and labor, and to follow the  trajectory of these struggles into a theoretical \u201cmainstream\u201d. Readings  establish connections between nationalist struggles, critiques of hegemony, and  resistant narratives, looking back over almost a century of foundational texts from Luxemburg to Gramsci,  to Mari\u00e1tegui, to Fanon and Memmi  and connecting them to the work of  writers as varied as Said, Chatterjee, Garc\u00eda Canclini, Pratt, Spivak, Jameson  and Appadurai. The course will proceed  thematically as a wide survey of history, criticism, and theory but always  considering forms of cultural production that often precede and exceed  theorization. Thematics include :   Reading the Present   Crisis Theory: Economy, Imperialism, Geography   Ideological Mapping: The South Hegemony, Politics   Decolonization, Violence, Revolution     Critical  Geographies and Underdevelopment     World  Systems, Spaces of Capital, Cultural Economies Genealogies  of Post-Colonialism: Methodologies of  the Contact Zone Critiques  of Nationalism Time  and Power: Modernity, Postmodernity, Belatedness Third World Productions: Magical Realism, National Allegory and Pastiche The  Ascent of the Postcolonial and the Politics of Disciplines Gendered  Revolutions/Feminist Territories Treacherous  Intellectuals and the Politics of Presence Permanent  Warfare, the End of Utopia and the Long Half-Life of the Cold War Readings: Readings  will be online or in the form of copy packets available at Advanced Copy   on LaGuardia Place. Where appropriate  whole texts will be on order at the NYU Bookstore Requirements : Occasional  weekly response paragraphs. One  Class Presentation: An oral and written pr\u00e9cis of a text or weekly thematic Two  shorter papers (including one based on the presentation), or, One  Final Paper to be due at the end of the semester in the second week of May. Requirements are  flexible and will be worked out with the class Reading List : Please note that this list is extensive and  provisional. It is meant as a syllabus  with an extended critical bibliography. We will not be reading everything on this list, but it is offered as a  pedagogical and research tool.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America    Garcia    This seminar examines the transnational  turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the  relationship between American Studies, Comparative Literature and other areas  of inquiry. We explore transnational and multi-lingual narratives that present  alternative aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical  junctures. We\u2019ll  devote special attention to invocations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that re-conceptualize the  U.S. domestic scene, effectively creating new objects of analysis, at turns  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We\u2019ll examine  longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of  the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of  the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual  cultures. Beyond literary and cultural theory, readings will  include works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella  Larsen, Jean Toomer, and Joseph O\u2019Neill.        Comparative Poetics: Lyric and Abjection: Early Modernity    Lezra    Close readings of poems in the Petrarchan tradition, with a view to showing that early modern lyric provides ways of thinking counter- or non-humanistic, even non-human, subjectivities. (I'm calling these, provisionally, \"abject,\" but the term won't stick). Poems from Petrarch's Rime sparse; the Pleaide group; Garcilaso, Quevedo, Gongora, Sor Juana; Wyatt, Surrey, Shakespeare, and Milton. Though the focus will be on the poems-on reading them attentively, for their arguments as well as their aesthetic enactments of or divergences from these-we'll be placing these readings in a conceptual map: theory of lyric; the theory of ideology; history and historiography (the secularization debate), and psychoanalysis (masochism, abjection, narcissism, object-relations). We'll be thinking through essays by Althusser, Deleuze, de Man, Blumenberg, Freud, Heidegger, Klein, Kohut, Kristeva, Lacan, Maravall, Sacher-Masoch, Schmitt, and Winnicott. (Some subset of these.)        Literature, History and Politics: Fiction, Historiography and the Event    Ross    In this seminar we will examine the construction,  disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and  theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of  fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of  collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability;  the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel,  Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.         Seminar in Literature: Research Methods &amp; Techniques: Literature &amp; the Law    Sanders    Can literature be thought as sharing its conditions of possibility with law? Concentrating on testimony broadly as a form of autobiographical self-fashioning, our seminar will explore this and related questions through a reading of key theoretical texts by Freud, Lacan, Klein, Derrida, and others, as well as fictional and non-fictional narrative by Daniel Paul Schreber, Joseph Conrad, Harriet Jacobs, Antjie Krog and others.

20th Century Thought    Bianchi    19 th and 20 th century continental philosophy,  from German idealism and romanticism, through Marxism, phenomenology,  psychoanalysis, deconstruction, and feminism, has received, retrieved, deployed  and reread the ancient Greeks in a myriad of ways and to a myriad of ends. In this class we will undertake close  readings of ancient texts in their own right, and explore their various  dispersals and appearances in a selection of 19 th and 20 th   century Western philosophical contexts. In so doing we will address methodological issues of retrieval and  reception. What fantasies, aspirations,  and anxieties are at work when modern authors engage classical antiquity? What do ancient references contribute to  modern arguments and to canon formation? How do these encounters help to illuminate the ancient text itself on  the one hand, and the contemporary projects \u2013 whether philosophical, national,  literary, or political \u2013 to which they are put on the other? Themes to be explored include German  nationalism\u2019s romance with ancient Greece; the role of antiquity in Hegelian  and Marxist dialectics; and materialisms ancient and modern. In particular, we will investigate the  impulse to return to the \u201cbirths\u201d of metaphysics, or tragedy, or the question  of Being, or patriarchy, as the \u201clateness\u201d or \u201ccompletion\u201d of modernity is  heralded. We will thereby trace continuities, displacements, breakages and  articulations that have occurred within and between these textual  traditions. Our study of ancient texts  will fall into five broad sections: Presocratics, tragedy (with particular focus on Sophocles\u2019 Antigone),  Plato, Aristotle, and ancient atomism. Modern authors will include Hegel, Marx, H\u00f6lderlin, Nietzsche,  Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida, Ira Gray, Althusser, Sch\u00fcrmann, and Butler.   Literature, History and Politics: Reading the Global South: Uneven Development, Critical Geography, &amp; Anti-Imperial Thinking    Dopico    This course seeks to create a  comparative ground for cultural politics typically separated by language,  imperial histories, and neo-colonial maps. It takes up the cultural, political, historical and theoretical  consequences and critiques of uneven development as an enduring truth of the  global order. It engages the politics  and economies of imperialism and the history and theory of  anti-imperialism. We will consider the  idea of the Global South as a topography of uneven development and uneven  temporalities, where notions of modernity and periphery are affirmed and  contested and where the names and practices of resistance, rebellion, and  critique continue to engage not only metropolitan centers but the force of the  state. The course looks beyond \u201carea  studies\u201d definitions and seeks a  materialist and critical geography, turning toward a hemispheric Southern  critique that challenged empire, globalization,  democratization, neoliberalism and permanent warfare long before the current  political moment. We will trace the  political and critical genealogies, the disciplinary canonizations, and the popular life of an indispensable contestatory  archive\u2014an archive whose long history helps to contextualize and demystify the  geopolitics of the present, as well as the politics of the academy. The course is in part designed to comparatists  and students of varied fields an interdisciplinary and historical knowledge of  texts whose messy political engagements and materialist foundations have lately  been rather marginalized by a reaffirmation of theoretical universals. We will consider how old ideological  mappings like third world,  underdevelopment, revolution survive and how old imperial and cold wars haunt  new politics and geopolitical destinies. The course traces themes and variations of a global anti-imperialism,  its constituencies, and its critical strategies; it stresses how these  contestatory narratives have irrevocably altered the cultural politics and  cultural markets of international metropoli and international policy. It seeks also to distinguish \u201csouthern\u201d  contexts for struggles around feminism, race and labor, and to follow the  trajectory of these struggles into a theoretical \u201cmainstream\u201d. Readings  establish connections between nationalist struggles, critiques of hegemony, and  resistant narratives, looking back over almost a century of foundational texts from Luxemburg to Gramsci,  to Mari\u00e1tegui, to Fanon and Memmi  and connecting them to the work of  writers as varied as Said, Chatterjee, Garc\u00eda Canclini, Pratt, Spivak, Jameson  and Appadurai. The course will proceed  thematically as a wide survey of history, criticism, and theory but always  considering forms of cultural production that often precede and exceed  theorization. Thematics include :   Reading the Present   Crisis Theory: Economy, Imperialism, Geography   Ideological Mapping: The South Hegemony, Politics   Decolonization, Violence, Revolution     Critical  Geographies and Underdevelopment     World  Systems, Spaces of Capital, Cultural Economies Genealogies  of Post-Colonialism: Methodologies of  the Contact Zone Critiques  of Nationalism Time  and Power: Modernity, Postmodernity, Belatedness Third World Productions: Magical Realism, National Allegory and Pastiche The  Ascent of the Postcolonial and the Politics of Disciplines Gendered  Revolutions/Feminist Territories Treacherous  Intellectuals and the Politics of Presence Permanent  Warfare, the End of Utopia and the Long Half-Life of the Cold War Readings: Readings  will be online or in the form of copy packets available at Advanced Copy   on LaGuardia Place. Where appropriate  whole texts will be on order at the NYU Bookstore Requirements : Occasional  weekly response paragraphs. One  Class Presentation: An oral and written pr\u00e9cis of a text or weekly thematic Two  shorter papers (including one based on the presentation), or, One  Final Paper to be due at the end of the semester in the second week of May. Requirements are  flexible and will be worked out with the class Reading List : Please note that this list is extensive and  provisional. It is meant as a syllabus  with an extended critical bibliography. We will not be reading everything on this list, but it is offered as a  pedagogical and research tool.      Culture and Critique: Transnational America    Garcia    This seminar examines the transnational  turn in U.S. literary studies and the resulting reconfiguration of the  relationship between American Studies, Comparative Literature and other areas  of inquiry. We explore transnational and multi-lingual narratives that present  alternative aesthetic accounts of \u201cAmerica\u201d during different historical  junctures. We\u2019ll  devote special attention to invocations of \u201cAmerica\u201d that re-conceptualize the  U.S. domestic scene, effectively creating new objects of analysis, at turns  smaller and larger than the nation-form. If \u201ctrans\u201d is from the Latin for  \u201cover, across or beyond,\u201d we ask what it means to think about American  literature as \u201cover,\u201d \u201cacross,\u201d or \u201cbeyond\u201d the nation form. We\u2019ll examine  longstanding varieties of comparative cultural studies, including theories of  the Black Atlantic, and more recent efforts to globally re-map American  literary cultures and theorize American literature through concepts of  the planetary. Among our recurrent themes will be the anti-colonial imagination nurtured by transnational intellectual  cultures. Beyond literary and cultural theory, readings will  include works by such writers as Henry James, Claude McKay, Sherwood Anderson, Nella  Larsen, Jean Toomer, and Joseph O\u2019Neill.        Comparative Poetics: Lyric and Abjection: Early Modernity    Lezra    Close readings of poems in the Petrarchan tradition, with a view to showing that early modern lyric provides ways of thinking counter- or non-humanistic, even non-human, subjectivities. (I'm calling these, provisionally, \"abject,\" but the term won't stick). Poems from Petrarch's Rime sparse; the Pleaide group; Garcilaso, Quevedo, Gongora, Sor Juana; Wyatt, Surrey, Shakespeare, and Milton. Though the focus will be on the poems-on reading them attentively, for their arguments as well as their aesthetic enactments of or divergences from these-we'll be placing these readings in a conceptual map: theory of lyric; the theory of ideology; history and historiography (the secularization debate), and psychoanalysis (masochism, abjection, narcissism, object-relations). We'll be thinking through essays by Althusser, Deleuze, de Man, Blumenberg, Freud, Heidegger, Klein, Kohut, Kristeva, Lacan, Maravall, Sacher-Masoch, Schmitt, and Winnicott. (Some subset of these.)        Literature, History and Politics: Fiction, Historiography and the Event    Ross    In this seminar we will examine the construction,  disappearance, and persistence of \u201ceventfulness\u201din fiction, historiography, and  theory. We will consider narrative theory as it pertains to the writing of  fictional and historical texts; the historical novel genre; the problem of  collective memory; subjectivity and historical agency; historical time and regimes of figurability;  the question of \u201cthe recent past.\u201d Case Study: the Paris Commune. Readings to include Lukacs, Ricoeur, Braudel,  Bakhtin, Badiou, Ranci\u00e8re, and Trouillot.         Seminar in Literature: Research Methods &amp; Techniques: Literature &amp; the Law    Sanders    Can literature be thought as sharing its conditions of possibility with law? Concentrating on testimony broadly as a form of autobiographical self-fashioning, our seminar will explore this and related questions through a reading of key theoretical texts by Freud, Lacan, Klein, Derrida, and others, as well as fictional and non-fictional narrative by Daniel Paul Schreber, Joseph Conrad, Harriet Jacobs, Antjie Krog and others.

The chronological extent of the course reaches from the late eighteenth century to the late twentieth century. In general, the course will not discuss the history of the Russian empire or the Soviet Union, though some issues will inevitably be relevant to Eastern Europe. The course will consider the entire region of Eastern Europe, but issues from Polish, Czech, and South Slavic history will be particularly prominent.               HIST-GA.1126 Rulers and Ruled in Imperial Rome and Byzantium     With an astonishingly long life span, extending from Antiquity to the end of the Middle Ages in the Byzantine East, the Roman Empire left a legacy of political and legal organization that has shaped the modern world. This seminar explores, on the one hand, the representation and exercise of imperial power and, on the other, the way the emperor\u2019s subjects perceived their position within the system and experienced authority, official or not. We will investigate imperial legitimacy building, political discourse, consensus and opposition, negotiation and concessions to the powerful, local government and justice, corruption, oppression and patronage, as well as the social groupings and networks that afforded some leverage to the less powerful.               HIST-GA.1196 European Fascisms in Comparative Perspective     Fascism, so one recent history has argued, posed the greatest challenge to liberal democracy during the 20th century. Fascism offered new answers to the problems arising from mass politics, industrialization, technology, and imperialism, and in doing so it sought to remake society, the continent of Europe, and the world. Our goal will be to develop a critical understanding of fascism as a product of the problems arising from modernity, and to understand how and why much of Europe took a violent path that ended in world war and genocide.          This course will study the development of fascism in interwar Europe in a comparative perspective, looking at it as an ideology, as a series of social movements, and eventually as a set of regimes that governed people\u2019s lives. The primary focus will lie on National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy, but several weeks will be devoted both to Eastern European movements and the Spanish Civil War. Beginning with the intellectual origins of fascism in 19th century bourgeois Europe and World War I, we will move on to examine why fascist movements seized power in certain states but not others. We will then study how fascist regimes, once in power, cultivated popular support and legitimacy; how they developed their own systems of economics, aesthetics, science, and race; how these regimes shaped the everyday lives of their subjects; and how they radicalized with the onset of war. We will conclude by trying to understand how these illiberal regimes can best be interpreted\u2014totalitarian, fascist, racist, or as unique phenomena\u2014 and how they have been remembered. By the end of this course you will produce a substantial final paper.               HIST-GA.1200 Literature of the Field: Modern Latin America     Surveys major literature and historiographical issues in the modern Latin American field.               HIST-GA.1417 History of Modern Ireland II     This two-part survey course seeks to analyze modern Irish history before and after the Act of Union of 1800. The first semester seeks to understand the conditions of possibility for the Union itself: conquest and colonization, resistance and rebellion; the formation of the Protestant Ascendancy and the imperial context of the British state; the discursive development of Irish nationalism; the demographic and societal shifts occasioned by economic development, agricultural change, and emigration; and the Irish contexts of the Enlightenment and the Atlantic revolutions. The second semester examines the impact of the Union and the stages of its dissolution on Irish life, considering the role of Ireland in the British empire; the nature of civil society in Ireland, and the cultural and political dimensions of nationalism and unionism before and after independence; the role of the Irish diaspora on developments in Ireland; and the particular nature of the Irish experience of urbanization, modernization, and globalization.            HIST-GA.1552 Renaissance Italy    The principal goal of the course is to provide students with a working knowledge of the historiography of Renaissance Italy. The course is organized around some of the major themes and conceptual problems in the literature, including the social structure and political systems of Italian City-States; the Papacy and its role in Italian politics and culture; the intellectual and social role of the humanists; art and art patronage. Since complete coverage would be impossible, the course strives to provide a mix of classic texts and more recent scholarship in an effort to familiarize the students with the methods, objectives, and research techniques employed by historians of the Italian Renaissance. In so doing, the course will prepare students to apply these methods and insights to their own work.            HIST-GA.1563 Black Internationalisms     Black Internationalisms is an exploration of those examples and moments in modern/post-modern history in which manifested important transnational cooperative ventures between and among African-descended populations and/or representatives of those populations. The idea is to examine conditions conducive to and reasons for collaboration, together with forces and factors militating against it, with a view toward engaging with its intellectual and cultural productivity. Such investigation provides enormous insights into the complexity of diaspora, and how it has been variously interpreted and re-imagined over time and across cultures.            HIST-GA.1610 Literature of the Field: 19th Century US History     A reading course covering the later period of American history that introduces students to the major themes, interpretations, and methods of inquiry. It is intended to provide a broad command of the field.            HIST-GA.1620 Twentieth Century France     This course will explore central issues in the history of France from the late nineteenth century to the current era. We begin with an examination of the Dreyfus Affair, an extraordinary national convulsion over anti-Semitism and a miscarriage of justice that left a powerful legacy for the rest of the twentieth century. We then turn to the First World War, giving special attention to its effects on the economy, government, social classes, and the relationship between men and women, and between colonial peoples and the French empire. Our focus then shifts to the 1930s, when the country was shaken by the Great Depression, the rise of political extremism, and the struggle to forge a \u201cpopular front\u201d against fascism. We then spend several weeks exploring the Second World War, its anticipation, the French defeat of 1940, the Occupation, Resistance, Liberation, and postwar reconstruction amid the early years of the Cold War. The Second World War also had an enormous impact on the empire. We turn our attention to the wars over decolonization after 1945, especially in Algeria. The course concludes with a focus on Gaullism, the rebellion of May 1968, postcolonial immigration, the rise of the anti-immigrant National Front, and controversies over gender, sexuality, religion, and globalization in the final decade of the twentieth century. Although the course is organized around a chronological examination of the political history of France, we will stress social, cultural, and economic history as well. After all, the century of total wars also brought France its period of most rapid social and economic change. We will investigate issues that call for crossing the usual boundaries between these several kinds of history. We will also repeatedly consider French developments within three wider international contexts: Europe, the French empire, and trans-Atlantic relations.            HIST-GA.1757 Approaches to Public History     Public historians build bridges between the work of academic historians and the interests of audiences who reach far beyond college classrooms. Through readings, media, visits by working public historians, and project work, this course explores the intellectual and pragmatic issues public historians face as they build those bridges in a variety of settings from the brick-and-mortar precincts of museums and public sites to the vast digital reaches of the internet.            HIST-GA.1784 African History Seminar     This course is a research seminar. It is mainly intended for students who have completed the Literature of the Field: Africa course and developed a research proposal as a final project. Other students who have had equivalent preparation and have a research project ready to go may also take this course with permission of the instructor.            HIST-GA.1985 Italy in World War II     This course covers Italy from 1940 to 1945, with a focus on cultural and political responses to war and on how the war has been represented in memory. The course is thematic rather than chronological in nature; our sources include reportage, novels, archival documents, memoirs, and non-fiction and feature film as our sources. Ongoing themes will include the meanings of resistance and collaboration; the problematics of testimony, witnessing, and memory; the impact of war on gender roles and identities; and the representation of violence.            HIST-GA.2001 Literature of the Field: Atlantic History     Introduces students to the major themes, scholarly approaches, and sources for Atlantic history.            HIST-GA.2002 The Atlantic Economy in the Early Modern World     This colloquium looks at the wide range of factors (i.e., historical circumstances, personal initiative, resources allocation, slave labor, technological innovation, market formation, etc.) that created and sustained the early modern Atlantic economy (1350-1800). The course will trace the evolution of the Atlantic economy from the dislocations of the fourteenth century through the reconfiguration of the Atlantic trading environment that followed the American Revolution. Students will examine Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French, British (English, Scottish, and Irish), and African contributions, as well as those of diasporic communities such as the Sephardic Jews and French Huguenots. A close study of early-modern commercial life will reveal much about the economic, social, and political arrangements that defined the commercial environment of the Atlantic World.            HIST-GA.2011 Internship Seminar     Seminar setting in which students consider a variety of issues and topics relating to their fieldwork sites and internship venues. Topics include public policy, historic site interpretation, digital humanities, current archival and museological theory, and leadership in cultural institutions. Students complete a 120-hour internship/ practicum at a cooperating archives or public history site, arranged through the program director.            HIST-GA.2016 Institutional Archives &amp; Electronic Records     This course focuses on the concepts, practices, and concerns related to the management of institutional archives, that is, those records documenting an institution itself. Examines the organizational leadership role of the archivist; the records and information needs of businesses, nonprofits, universities, and governments; records management theory and practice; the legal and ethical frameworks for records and archives; and the administration of electronic records programs.            HIST-GA.2034 Research Seminar     Capstone seminar in which students create final projects in the program with a substantial research and writing component. Projects may take the form of historical theses, exhibition designs, historical editing projects, Web-based resources, or historic site interpretations. Class meetings allow students to focus on and discuss research issues.            HIST-GA.2163 Economy and the State in Europe: Debates in Historical Political Economy     This course explores the interrelationship between political and economic structures in Europe, and in the empires controlled by European states, from the seventeenth century to the twentieth. Without any pretentions to comprehensive coverage, the course offers an overview of some major topics and debates in the history of European and global political economy. Among the key questions to be addressed are the following: Why did empire fail to increase the wealth of Spain in the long run while it propelled the Dutch and the English to leading economic and political roles in Europe and globally? Why did parts of Europe pull ahead of the rest of the world in economic development and per capita income, and when did this process begin? How did warfare and revolution create the conditions for the emergence of modern public finance, and how did this financial revolution in turn transform the military capacities and the constitutional configurations of the European states that enacted it? What were the causes of the Industrial Revolution in Britain? Why did this shift not occur at the same time in competing European economies or in world regions with similar endowments? What were the economics of empire in the nineteenth century, and what political economic factors helped produce decolonization? How was European political economy transformed by the two world wars and the depression, and what forms did postwar reconstruction take? What was the political economy of communism in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, and why did this political and social system collapse? Readings include both classic scholarship and recent work in this field. No background in economics or economic history is assumed, nor will such a background be necessary to participate fully in the course.            HIST-GA.2294 Writing Gender Histories     The focus of this course is the research and writing of gender history. Not only will we discuss the overlap and tensions between the fields of women\u2019s history and gender history, we shall also consider histories of sexuality and the body. Class meetings and readings will emphasize methodologies and practices of gender historical research and writing, including: the definition and delineation of sources (primary, secondary, or hybrid); the challenges of narration; and the process of learning to read our own texts both critically and with attention to internal contradictions and/or silences. Course readings shall cover a range of geographical fields and time periods.          HIST-GA.2555 African Slavery and the Atlantic Slave Trade     This colloquium is designed around a number of provocative readings, including core texts, novels, films, and presentations by Professor Hull and enrolled students. We explore the various dimensions of master-servant relationships in pre-colonial African societies and how they were transformed into more classical forms of human bondage and exploitation. Issues to be examined are slavery and male/ female relationships, slavery and empowerment, and the commoditization of humanity in Africa. We will also consider origins and expansion of the Atlantic slave trade itself and plantation agriculture. We will assess the financing and actual conduct of the slave trade from point of capture, to embarkation, overseas voyage, and finally to the plantations in the Americas. Students will explore how and why this trade began, who financed and operated it, and who in society were its beneficiaries and its victims. We will consider the impact of the slave trades on Africa, the Americas, the Middle East, and on European countries that were directly involved. Finally, students will analyze the motivations and outcomes of efforts in Europe, Africa, and the Americas, to illegalize and ultimately to abolish the slave trade. We will also explore why slavery and the slave trade persisted in Africa and the Middle East until well into the 20th century and why it is re-emerging in many parts of the world today.        This graduate course is open to advanced undergraduate students with permission of Professor Hull.              HIST-GA.2561 Theorizing Race and Slavery      This   colloquium explores racial slavery both as histories and as groundings   for more contemporary studies of race, culture, economies, and power. We   will consider various theoretical models for thinking both about the   problems of race and slavery and about how histories of slavery provide   theoretical models for considerations across the disciplines. The   readings will draw from history, economics, literature, and cultural   studies. The object here is to consider how the subject of slavery is   situated in relation to broader considerations of power, violence, and   identity. My intent is to lay the groundwork for an interdisciplinary   understanding of the black Atlantic. To consider the consequences of   slavery and the slave trade, both historically and contemporarily, on   modern intellectual formations and institutions.          HIST-GA.2606 Human Rights and Humanitarian Perspective     This course will explore the web of good intentions and contradictions surrounding the issue of human rights and \"humanitarian\" interventions. We will begin with selected metanarratives about the history of human rights. We will then read some of the founding documents on which human rights theory rests. Next, we will spend three weeks examining the problems of enforcing human rights by looking closely at the issues of crimes of war, torture, economic and women's rights. We will then turn our attention to the question of genocide and recent efforts both to define and act against it. Here the central cases are Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. We shall conclude the class by posing the dilemmas facing liberal interventionism in defense of human rights.            HIST-GA.2707 Social History in Questions: Practices, Proposals and Debates, 1900-2013     Social history has been under attack on many sides for the last three decades. There is a risk here to forget the crucial role it has plaid in the renewal of historical knowledge, thinking, and methods throughout the last century. The course intends to offer a critical approach to some major points of the historiographical debate from the beginning of the 20th century to the present. It offers as well a substantial amount of optional, interdisciplinary readings which will be presented and discussed in class.            HIST-GA.2790 Comparative Social Movements     This course examines a variety of global social movements of the 20th century, including those in South Africa, Argentina, Palestine and the US (civil rights, the Ku Klux Klan, and women's liberation), along with theoretical reading about social movements. It is a research seminar designed to support students in producing a paper related to social movements in their own field of specialization, so the syllabus may change to reflect students' interests.        Social movements have been theorized primarily by social scientists: a typical sociological definition is, episodes of collective behavior and action that aim to create social change and command significant grassroots participation. We will consider these theories but also asking questions of the sorts historians (and thoughtful activists) must ask, such as: what contexts and local histories have engendered social movements? how have social movements constructed identities? have there been entirely apolitical social movements? have there been elite social movements? when and why have social movements become violent? have social movements been inevitably vulnerable to demagoguery and authoritarianism?             HIST-GA.2800 Historical Consciousness in Latin America     This course is an exploration of what can loosely be termed \u201chistorical consciousness\u201d or \u201chistorical imagination,\u201d that is, a broad field of images, sensibilities, conceptions, interpretations, and explanations of history. Aspects of collective memory and representations of the past play a central role in the course, of course, but we will also want to consider broader notions of time, historical process and periodization, and the future as a projection of history. Among the questions at the core of our inquiry will be: why history matters in Latin American culture and politics, and how interpretations of history reflect concerns in the present. Much of the course will look at intellectual and cultural production as well as political ideology in the twentieth century in Latin America. It will address elite as well as popular cultures, and do so from a range of disciplinary perspectives (history, anthropology, cultural studies, sociology, literature).            HIST-GA.2901 Golieb Research Colloquium     The Golieb Research Colloquium is successor to the Legal History Colloquium and continues its unique mission--the training of young scholars rather than the testing of ideas of senior professors. The core of the Golieb Research Colloquium consists of the Samuel I. Golieb Fellows , a group of two or three fledgling academics each year from schools around the United States. Golieb Fellows, who either have completed or are currently completing their graduate work in legal history, have come to NYU from doctoral programs at Cambridge, Columbia, Duke, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Michigan, Princeton, Rice, Stanford, Virginia, Yale, and other universities. Other participants in the Colloquium have included J.D. students and graduate students at NYU, Fulbright Scholars from Europe, and faculty from NYU Law School and other law schools in the metropolitan region.

HIST-GA.3213 Eastern Europe Workshop     This 2-credit course involves discussion of selected readings concerning Eastern Europe, discussion of graduate student papers and current research concerning Eastern Europe, attendance at guest lectures concerning Eastern Europe, and independent research on Eastern Europe guided by the instructor.            HIST-GA.3613 Approaches to Historical Research and Writing II     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the basic methodological and interpretive issues involved in historical research. Based around a core set of readings, the course covers important books and articles that explicitly deal with questions of method, as well as examples of certain methodologies or schools of historiography in action. The goal of this course is to help the student produce a research paper that is of potentially publishable quality and to reveal that the student is capable of doing graduate level research and writing.            HIST-GA.3803 Atlantic History Workshop     Introduces students to the major themes and scholarly approaches of Atlantic history. Readings will include works on cultural interactions, trade and commodities, Atlantic diasporas, comparative imperial histories, legal encounters and trends, labor regimes, and rebellion and revolution. Students will be responsible for extensive weekly readings and short papers, as well as a longer paper on the historiography of a particular problem in Atlantic history.              HIST-GA.3902 \"A Modern Mediterranean Region: Myth or Reality\"     Examines major political, cultural, and social trends of the region during the past two centuries, focusing on whether it is correct to locate these developments as particularly \u201cMediterranean\u201d or not.
