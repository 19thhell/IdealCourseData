The degree program in Medieval and Renaissance Studies is specifically designed for students wishing to work in more than one field of specialization. The twenty to twenty-five College of Arts and Sciences courses which MARC sponsors and cross-lists every semester enable undergraduates to study and do research in a variety of departments, and at libraries, museums, and collections throughout the New York area. Courses meeting the requirements for the MARS major and minor can also be taken at many sites abroad administered by NYU. These include both summer and year-long programs in London, Paris, Madrid, Athens, and Florence. Individual advising enables students in MARS to develop a coherent interdisciplinary course of study that suits their needs and interests. Fields from which students may draw to develop their course of study presently include: language and literature; fine arts; history; music; philosophy and religion. A special Honors track within the College enables qualified majors to undertake research projects and prepare a thesis. Students may also take advantage of the College's accelerated B.A./M.A. program. Also available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo Travel Award, granted each year to allow an outstanding major or minor to travel abroad.
