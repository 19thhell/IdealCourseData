Description:  There are many cognitive tasks that people can do easily and almost unconsciously but that have proven extremely difficult to program on a computer. Artificial intelligence is the problem of developing computer systems that can carry out these tasks.  We will focus on three central areas in AI: natural language processing,  representation and reasoning, and learning.     Requirements     Problem sets and programming assignments (40% of the grade)  Midterm (25% of the grade).  Final Exam (35% of the grade)     Topics     Natural Language Processing (Chap 22,23)  Search (Chap 3).  Game Playing (Chap. 5)   Logic and Automated Reasoning (Chap 7,8)  Reasoning with Uncertainty (Probabilistic reasoning) (Chap 13,14)  Machine Learning (Chap 18)     Assignments  All assignments should be uploaded onto the NYU Classes site. Problem sets should be in either plain text, PDF, or Word.    Problem sets and programming assignments are due at the beginning of class  on the due date. Problem sets will be accepted up to a week late with a penalty of 1 point out of 10. Programming assignments will be accepted up to two weeks late with a penalty of 1 point  out of 10 the first week and 2 points the second week.     Problem set 1 due Feb 4.

Topics on Final Exam    Cheating  You may discuss any of the assignments with your classmates (or anyone else) but all work for all assignments must be  entirely your own. Any sharing or copying of assignments will be considered cheating. By the rules of the College of Arts and Science, I am required to report any incidents of cheating to the department. My policy is that the first incident of cheating will result in the student getting a grade of F for the course. The second incident, by CAS rules, will result in a semester suspension from the College.    In general you may not use material found on the web in assignments. If in some particular case, you think it is legitimate to use material found on the web, consult with me personally. If you think it is legitimate and for whatever  reason are unable to consult with me, then include a specific citation of where it comes from; that way, it is clear that you had no dishonest  intention in mind. (Your grade may be docked, because you did not do the assignment yourself, but it will not be treated as cheating.) If it is determined that you got material from the web, and you did not include a citation, then that constitutes dishonest concealment of sources, and will be considered cheating.
