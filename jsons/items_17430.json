Algorithms increasingly shape our news, economic options, and educational trajectories. The centrality and concerns about algorithmic decision making have only increased since we hosted the Governing Algorithms conference in May 2013. This event built upon that conversation to address legal, policy and ethical challenges related to algorithmic power in three specific contexts: media production and consumption, commerce, and education.   Date, Location, Organization   The Algorithms and Accountability conference took place on Saturday, February 28th, 2015, at New York University, Lipton Hall, NYC. Organized by the Information Law Institute, NYU School of Law, it was cosponsored by NYU Steinhardt Department of Media, Culture and Communications, the Intel Science &amp; Technology Center for Social Computing and Microsoft. The organizing committee consists of Joris van Hoboken, Helen Nissenbaum and Elana Zeide.
