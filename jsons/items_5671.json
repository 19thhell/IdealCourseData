The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

Admission to the Dental Hygiene Programs is highly competitive and applicants are accepted on the basis of their predicted success in the program. In addition, an individual must meet the Health and Technical Standards for Pre-Matriculation for Dental Hygiene Programs in order to be eligible for admission to, progression in, and graduation from the Dental Hygiene Programs at the NYUCD.   Minimum Academic Requirements for Admission   The minimum requirements for consideration are as follows:     Grade point average of 80% or higher (high school applicants)   SAT or ACT test scores (high school applicants)   A grade point average of 3.0 from 12 credits of college study (transfer applicants)   Biology and chemistry courses successfully completed at the high school or college level with a grade of B or better, within a 10-year period before the student\u2019s matriculation at the College of Dentistry.     Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. If you have not completed the biology or chemistry prerequisite courses, you can complete them at the College of Dentistry. Click here to see the prerequisite course offerings for the upcoming semester. If you would like to take the courses before submitting an application for admission to the Dental Hygiene programs, you may use our online application to apply as a non-degree student.   If you wish to submit a application for full admission to the Dental Hygiene program knowing that you will need to complete the prerequisites, you may use the online application to apply as a pre-requisite student. Non-degree and pre-requisite students DO NOT qualify for financial aid.   Admissions Policies                                                  Writing Placement Exam                               All admitted students must take a Writing Placement Exam through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University prior to the first day of mandatory orientation. Pending the results of your mandatory writing placement exam, you may be required to take individual writing courses listed below before registering for Writing Workshop I.     Effective Reading and Writing for College (non-credit course)   Grammar Strategies (non-credit course)   Intensive Writing (optional non-credit or 2 credit course)     Exam scores are usually forwarded to the Dental Hygiene Office two weeks after the exam date. You may contact our office at that time to receive your results. Students are required to meet with their faculty advisor to discuss registration for the individual writing courses in order to review their academic plan.   This exam may be waived, by review, for students entering the program intending to transfer two courses, with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better, of College-level English Composition.                                                              Transfer Credit Policy                               The transferring of credits process is done after official college transcript(s) or translated course-by-course evaluated documents have been received. The courses are reviewed for similar content and level. Science courses are transferred at a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better. Liberal arts courses are transferred at a grade of &quot;C&quot; of better. All students who transfer courses must still meet the competency requirements found within the course in order for the transfer to be completed. No transfer credit is granted for workshops and continuing education classes.   Official transcripts from all previously attended institutions must be submitted and students must be registered for credits to post on academic records.   Once a student is matriculated and enrolled in the Dental Hygiene Programs, core science or writing courses will not be transferred. Only Psychology, Sociology, Oral Communications and extra liberal arts credits can be transferred from another accredited institution as a matriculated student. Only under limited circumstances may the Dean of Allied Health Programs grant permission to approve any other course(s).   Note: Credits are not transferred for courses taken more than ten (10) years ago.   Note: The prerequisite chemistry course does not transfer in place of the Chemistry for Allied Health core Dental Hygiene course.   STUDENTS WITH FOREIGN TRANSCRIPTS: The Dental Hygiene Programs will only consider evaluations from ECE for transfer credits. Course transfers may be limited, subject to intense review of course content through the student providing course descriptions and may require the student to take a proficiency exam to consider core course(s) for transfer.                                                              Transfer of Specific Courses                                 Writing Courses  Students entering the program may be reviewed for satisfying the writing requirement by transferring two courses, at the time of admission, with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better, of College level writing-intensive English composition courses from an accredited College or University if they have previously completed at least fifteen (15) college credits with a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or better. Students must also meet the following criteria:   Official transcript(s) must be submitted.   Students may be asked to submit graded coursework and or course descriptions relating to the desired courses to be transferred.   Two+ courses must be transferred. One course will not be transferred.           Anatomy &amp; Physiology I and Anatomy &amp; Physiology II  At NYUCD, the Dental Hygiene Programs teaches the standard course content of Anatomy &amp; Physiology I under the course title Anatomy &amp; Physiology II. Course content of Anatomy &amp; Physiology II is taught under the course title Anatomy &amp; Physiology I.     For example, if a student took A&amp;P I at another college and received a grade of B or better, that course would be considered for transfer in place of the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Programs\u2019 A&amp;P II course.       Microbiology  If a single Microbiology course was taken at an outside institution, the credits will be transferred to meet the Microbiology I requirement at the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Programs, regardless of the number of credits earned.                                                                  Transfer of Other Dental Hygiene Courses                               Students may receive credit for dental hygiene courses taken at an accredited dental hygiene program or school. Such courses must have a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better and be comparable in content to courses required for the AAS or BS Dental Hygiene Programs NYUCD.                                                              Transfer Residence Requirement (Bachelor\u2019s Degree Only)                               The Dental Hygiene Programs' residency requirement is 32 credits. To be eligible for a degree, a transfer student must complete a minimum of 32 credits with an average of 2.0 or higher in courses held in the Dental Hygiene Programs during two or more terms. All course requirements must be completed within six years from the date of matriculation. Continuous maintenance of matriculation is required. Students should check with the Office of the University Registrar regarding the policy governing excess credits earned toward the associate and baccalaureate degree. A student is not permitted to be matriculated for more than one degree at a time.                                                              American Language Institute                               Some students are accepted into the Dental Hygiene Programs contingent upon the results of testing through this institute or may be recommended to take intensive English courses through this department upon the results of the University\u2019s mandatory Writing Placement Exam (once accepted into the program).   The American Language Institute of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language. It also offers the University Preparatory Workshop program in English for students with English proficiency insufficient to undertake a full academic program but sufficient for a part-time academic program in combination with part-time English study. This combination may constitute a full-time program of study.                                                                               application process Read More                      frequently asked questions Read More               LEARN MORE:     Prerequisite Courses   Student Registration Help   Academic Calendar   Health and Technical Standards   Join Our Mailing List                                                                              Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}]},

The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

Admission to the Dental Hygiene Programs is highly competitive and applicants are accepted on the basis of their predicted success in the program. In addition, an individual must meet the Health and Technical Standards for Pre-Matriculation for Dental Hygiene Programs in order to be eligible for admission to, progression in, and graduation from the Dental Hygiene Programs at the NYUCD.   Minimum Academic Requirements for Admission   The minimum requirements for consideration are as follows:     Grade point average of 80% or higher (high school applicants)   SAT or ACT test scores (high school applicants)   A grade point average of 3.0 from 12 credits of college study (transfer applicants)   Biology and chemistry courses successfully completed at the high school or college level with a grade of B or better, within a 10-year period before the student\u2019s matriculation at the College of Dentistry.     Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. If you have not completed the biology or chemistry prerequisite courses, you can complete them at the College of Dentistry. Click here to see the prerequisite course offerings for the upcoming semester. If you would like to take the courses before submitting an application for admission to the Dental Hygiene programs, you may use our online application to apply as a non-degree student.   If you wish to submit a application for full admission to the Dental Hygiene program knowing that you will need to complete the prerequisites, you may use the online application to apply as a pre-requisite student. Non-degree and pre-requisite students DO NOT qualify for financial aid.   Admissions Policies                                                  Writing Placement Exam                               All admitted students must take a Writing Placement Exam through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University prior to the first day of mandatory orientation. Pending the results of your mandatory writing placement exam, you may be required to take individual writing courses listed below before registering for Writing Workshop I.     Effective Reading and Writing for College (non-credit course)   Grammar Strategies (non-credit course)   Intensive Writing (optional non-credit or 2 credit course)     Exam scores are usually forwarded to the Dental Hygiene Office two weeks after the exam date. You may contact our office at that time to receive your results. Students are required to meet with their faculty advisor to discuss registration for the individual writing courses in order to review their academic plan.   This exam may be waived, by review, for students entering the program intending to transfer two courses, with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better, of College-level English Composition.                                                              Transfer Credit Policy                               The transferring of credits process is done after official college transcript(s) or translated course-by-course evaluated documents have been received. The courses are reviewed for similar content and level. Science courses are transferred at a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better. Liberal arts courses are transferred at a grade of &quot;C&quot; of better. All students who transfer courses must still meet the competency requirements found within the course in order for the transfer to be completed. No transfer credit is granted for workshops and continuing education classes.   Official transcripts from all previously attended institutions must be submitted and students must be registered for credits to post on academic records.   Once a student is matriculated and enrolled in the Dental Hygiene Programs, core science or writing courses will not be transferred. Only Psychology, Sociology, Oral Communications and extra liberal arts credits can be transferred from another accredited institution as a matriculated student. Only under limited circumstances may the Dean of Allied Health Programs grant permission to approve any other course(s).   Note: Credits are not transferred for courses taken more than ten (10) years ago.   Note: The prerequisite chemistry course does not transfer in place of the Chemistry for Allied Health core Dental Hygiene course.   STUDENTS WITH FOREIGN TRANSCRIPTS: The Dental Hygiene Programs will only consider evaluations from ECE for transfer credits. Course transfers may be limited, subject to intense review of course content through the student providing course descriptions and may require the student to take a proficiency exam to consider core course(s) for transfer.                                                              Transfer of Specific Courses                                 Writing Courses  Students entering the program may be reviewed for satisfying the writing requirement by transferring two courses, at the time of admission, with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better, of College level writing-intensive English composition courses from an accredited College or University if they have previously completed at least fifteen (15) college credits with a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or better. Students must also meet the following criteria:   Official transcript(s) must be submitted.   Students may be asked to submit graded coursework and or course descriptions relating to the desired courses to be transferred.   Two+ courses must be transferred. One course will not be transferred.           Anatomy &amp; Physiology I and Anatomy &amp; Physiology II  At NYUCD, the Dental Hygiene Programs teaches the standard course content of Anatomy &amp; Physiology I under the course title Anatomy &amp; Physiology II. Course content of Anatomy &amp; Physiology II is taught under the course title Anatomy &amp; Physiology I.     For example, if a student took A&amp;P I at another college and received a grade of B or better, that course would be considered for transfer in place of the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Programs\u2019 A&amp;P II course.       Microbiology  If a single Microbiology course was taken at an outside institution, the credits will be transferred to meet the Microbiology I requirement at the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Programs, regardless of the number of credits earned.                                                                  Transfer of Other Dental Hygiene Courses                               Students may receive credit for dental hygiene courses taken at an accredited dental hygiene program or school. Such courses must have a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better and be comparable in content to courses required for the AAS or BS Dental Hygiene Programs NYUCD.                                                              Transfer Residence Requirement (Bachelor\u2019s Degree Only)                               The Dental Hygiene Programs' residency requirement is 32 credits. To be eligible for a degree, a transfer student must complete a minimum of 32 credits with an average of 2.0 or higher in courses held in the Dental Hygiene Programs during two or more terms. All course requirements must be completed within six years from the date of matriculation. Continuous maintenance of matriculation is required. Students should check with the Office of the University Registrar regarding the policy governing excess credits earned toward the associate and baccalaureate degree. A student is not permitted to be matriculated for more than one degree at a time.                                                              American Language Institute                               Some students are accepted into the Dental Hygiene Programs contingent upon the results of testing through this institute or may be recommended to take intensive English courses through this department upon the results of the University\u2019s mandatory Writing Placement Exam (once accepted into the program).   The American Language Institute of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language. It also offers the University Preparatory Workshop program in English for students with English proficiency insufficient to undertake a full academic program but sufficient for a part-time academic program in combination with part-time English study. This combination may constitute a full-time program of study.                                                                               application process Read More                      frequently asked questions Read More               LEARN MORE:     Prerequisite Courses   Student Registration Help   Academic Calendar   Health and Technical Standards   Join Our Mailing List                                                                              Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}]},

The Dental Hygiene programs at NYU College of Dentistry provide extraordinary clinical and academic opportunities for students interested in preventive oral healthcare and the promotion of good health. A key member of the healthcare team, the dental hygienist works together with the dentist to meet the oral health needs of patients and thereby improve patients' quality of life.   The Office of Allied Health Programs houses two degree programs, both of which prepare students for careers in dental hygiene: Bachelor of Science (BS) in Dental Hygiene and Associate in Applied Science (AAS) in Dental Hygiene .   EDUCATIONAL GOALS AND MISSION   The mission of the New York University Dental Hygiene Programs is to partner with students to achieve academic excellence; promote scholarly activity, health promotion, disease prevention and research; to participate in community service; and to offer comprehensive client care, utilizing critical thinking and evidence-based decision making. As goals, the program will prepare a competent dental hygienist, maintain a contemporary dental hygiene program that reflects relevant and current dental hygiene practice, and provide an interdisciplinary integrated curriculum.   The NYU Advantage   Attending the only dental hygiene program housed within a dental college in the state of New York, Dental Hygiene students at the NYU College of Dentistry have the unique opportunity to work in integrated clinical settings alongside DDS students as well as faculty members from dental hygiene, dentistry and specialty areas -- gaining invaluable experiences as they learn the practice of dental hygiene while treating a highly diverse patient population. Academic excellence and clinical expertise are further supported by rotations through specialty areas (orthodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics, implant dentistry, and pediatric dentistry), preparing students through a comprehensive and challenging education.

Admission to the Dental Hygiene Programs is highly competitive and applicants are accepted on the basis of their predicted success in the program. In addition, an individual must meet the Health and Technical Standards for Pre-Matriculation for Dental Hygiene Programs in order to be eligible for admission to, progression in, and graduation from the Dental Hygiene Programs at the NYUCD.   Minimum Academic Requirements for Admission   The minimum requirements for consideration are as follows:     Grade point average of 80% or higher (high school applicants)   SAT or ACT test scores (high school applicants)   A grade point average of 3.0 from 12 credits of college study (transfer applicants)   Biology and chemistry courses successfully completed at the high school or college level with a grade of B or better, within a 10-year period before the student\u2019s matriculation at the College of Dentistry.     Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. If you have not completed the biology or chemistry prerequisite courses, you can complete them at the College of Dentistry. Click here to see the prerequisite course offerings for the upcoming semester. If you would like to take the courses before submitting an application for admission to the Dental Hygiene programs, you may use our online application to apply as a non-degree student.   If you wish to submit a application for full admission to the Dental Hygiene program knowing that you will need to complete the prerequisites, you may use the online application to apply as a pre-requisite student. Non-degree and pre-requisite students DO NOT qualify for financial aid.   Admissions Policies                                                  Writing Placement Exam                               All admitted students must take a Writing Placement Exam through the School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University prior to the first day of mandatory orientation. Pending the results of your mandatory writing placement exam, you may be required to take individual writing courses listed below before registering for Writing Workshop I.     Effective Reading and Writing for College (non-credit course)   Grammar Strategies (non-credit course)   Intensive Writing (optional non-credit or 2 credit course)     Exam scores are usually forwarded to the Dental Hygiene Office two weeks after the exam date. You may contact our office at that time to receive your results. Students are required to meet with their faculty advisor to discuss registration for the individual writing courses in order to review their academic plan.   This exam may be waived, by review, for students entering the program intending to transfer two courses, with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better, of College-level English Composition.                                                              Transfer Credit Policy                               The transferring of credits process is done after official college transcript(s) or translated course-by-course evaluated documents have been received. The courses are reviewed for similar content and level. Science courses are transferred at a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better. Liberal arts courses are transferred at a grade of &quot;C&quot; of better. All students who transfer courses must still meet the competency requirements found within the course in order for the transfer to be completed. No transfer credit is granted for workshops and continuing education classes.   Official transcripts from all previously attended institutions must be submitted and students must be registered for credits to post on academic records.   Once a student is matriculated and enrolled in the Dental Hygiene Programs, core science or writing courses will not be transferred. Only Psychology, Sociology, Oral Communications and extra liberal arts credits can be transferred from another accredited institution as a matriculated student. Only under limited circumstances may the Dean of Allied Health Programs grant permission to approve any other course(s).   Note: Credits are not transferred for courses taken more than ten (10) years ago.   Note: The prerequisite chemistry course does not transfer in place of the Chemistry for Allied Health core Dental Hygiene course.   STUDENTS WITH FOREIGN TRANSCRIPTS: The Dental Hygiene Programs will only consider evaluations from ECE for transfer credits. Course transfers may be limited, subject to intense review of course content through the student providing course descriptions and may require the student to take a proficiency exam to consider core course(s) for transfer.                                                              Transfer of Specific Courses                                 Writing Courses  Students entering the program may be reviewed for satisfying the writing requirement by transferring two courses, at the time of admission, with a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better, of College level writing-intensive English composition courses from an accredited College or University if they have previously completed at least fifteen (15) college credits with a cumulative GPA of 2.8 or better. Students must also meet the following criteria:   Official transcript(s) must be submitted.   Students may be asked to submit graded coursework and or course descriptions relating to the desired courses to be transferred.   Two+ courses must be transferred. One course will not be transferred.           Anatomy &amp; Physiology I and Anatomy &amp; Physiology II  At NYUCD, the Dental Hygiene Programs teaches the standard course content of Anatomy &amp; Physiology I under the course title Anatomy &amp; Physiology II. Course content of Anatomy &amp; Physiology II is taught under the course title Anatomy &amp; Physiology I.     For example, if a student took A&amp;P I at another college and received a grade of B or better, that course would be considered for transfer in place of the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Programs\u2019 A&amp;P II course.       Microbiology  If a single Microbiology course was taken at an outside institution, the credits will be transferred to meet the Microbiology I requirement at the NYUCD Dental Hygiene Programs, regardless of the number of credits earned.                                                                  Transfer of Other Dental Hygiene Courses                               Students may receive credit for dental hygiene courses taken at an accredited dental hygiene program or school. Such courses must have a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better and be comparable in content to courses required for the AAS or BS Dental Hygiene Programs NYUCD.                                                              Transfer Residence Requirement (Bachelor\u2019s Degree Only)                               The Dental Hygiene Programs' residency requirement is 32 credits. To be eligible for a degree, a transfer student must complete a minimum of 32 credits with an average of 2.0 or higher in courses held in the Dental Hygiene Programs during two or more terms. All course requirements must be completed within six years from the date of matriculation. Continuous maintenance of matriculation is required. Students should check with the Office of the University Registrar regarding the policy governing excess credits earned toward the associate and baccalaureate degree. A student is not permitted to be matriculated for more than one degree at a time.                                                              American Language Institute                               Some students are accepted into the Dental Hygiene Programs contingent upon the results of testing through this institute or may be recommended to take intensive English courses through this department upon the results of the University\u2019s mandatory Writing Placement Exam (once accepted into the program).   The American Language Institute of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language. It also offers the University Preparatory Workshop program in English for students with English proficiency insufficient to undertake a full academic program but sufficient for a part-time academic program in combination with part-time English study. This combination may constitute a full-time program of study.                                                                               application process Read More                      frequently asked questions Read More               LEARN MORE:     Prerequisite Courses   Student Registration Help   Academic Calendar   Health and Technical Standards   Join Our Mailing List                                                                              Academic Programs                                                 DDS Program                                                   Dental Hygiene Programs                                                   Advanced Education Programs                                                   Master's Degree Programs                                                   Certificate Program in Clinical Research                                                   Programs for International Dentists                                                                                                        Linhart Continuing Dental Education Program (CDE)                                                     Research                                                 Research at NYUCD                                                   Bluestone Center for Clinical Research                                                   HIV/AIDS Research Program (HARP)                                                   Consortium for Translational Orthodontic Research (CTOR)                                                   NYU Center for Skeletal and Craniofacial Biology (CSCB)                                                     Patient Care                                                 Become a Patient at NYUCD                                                   Emergency Services / Urgent Care                                                   General Dentistry                                                   Pediatric Dentistry                                                   Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery                                                   Orthodontics                                                   Implant Dentistry                                                   Endodontics                                                   Periodontics                                                   Prosthodontics                                                   Special Needs Program                                                   Patient Advocate                                                   Linhart CDE Program                                                   NYU Dental Faculty Practices                                                   NYU Oral Cancer Center                                                   NYU Nursing Faculty Practice                                                     Quick Links                                                 About Us                                                   Admissions Information                                                   Academy of Distinguished Educators                                                   Interprofessional Education                                                   Current Students                                                   Intranet                                                   Departments/Faculty                                                   Global Reach                                                   News, Publications and Facts                                                   Working at NYUCD                                                   Contact Us                                                   Directions                                                    Connect                  NYU College of Dentistry  345 E. 24th Street  (corner of First Avenue)  New York, NY, 10010                            (212) 998-9800                            NYUCD Facebook Page       NYUCD Twitter Page       NYUCD YouTube Page       NYUCD LinkedIn Page                 MAKE A GIFT                                                    Copyright &copy; New York University College of Dentistry          Feedback"}]}]
