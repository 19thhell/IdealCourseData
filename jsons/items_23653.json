Haugen, Ph.D.   Peter.Haugen@nyumc.org   Number of Externs: 3   The Externship Track in Trauma Psychology provides training on the assessment and psychosocial treatment of trauma, focusing on clinical work with survivors of torture, war, and terrorism. Each extern will be placed in either the World Trade Center Health Program New York University Clinical Center of Excellence at Bellevue Hospital Center (NYU CCE) or the Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture (PSOT. Specifically,\u00a0 two externs \u00a0will be placed with PSOT and\u00a0 one extern\u00a0 with NYU CCE. All Trauma Track externs will participate in a weekly didactic series.   World Trade Center Health Program New York University Clinical Center of Excellence at Bellevue Hospital Center   The World Trade Center Health Program New York University Clinical Center of Excellence at Bellevue Hospital Center (NYU CCE;\u00a0 http://www.cdc.gov/wtc/ ) provides ongoing medical and psychiatric monitoring and treatment to eligible first responders \u2013 law enforcement personnel, construction/iron workers, emergency medical personnel \u2013 who were involved in rescue, recovery, and restoration activities following the attacks of 9/11/01 on the WTC.   This placement provides externs with a variety of experiences in the monitoring, assessment, and treatment of psychological conditions associated with occupational exposure to the events of 9/11/01. Externs will gain experience with psychological, social, cognitive, and medical sequelae of occupational exposure to potentially traumagenic stressors, including PTSD and other anxiety disorders, depression, and/or substance/alcohol-use disorders. Mental health assessment and treatment is provided as part of an interdisciplinary treatment team, comprised of psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and physicians with specialties in the areas of occupational and pulmonary medicine.   Externs on this rotation will perform weekly, trauma-focused individual psychotherapy. Possibilities for psychological assessments, couples, and group psychotherapy also exist. All externs will participate in once-weekly, individual supervision. In addition, each extern will attend and participate in weekly, 90 minute lab meetings with the NYU CCE mental health treatment team. Topics include training in evidence-based trauma treatments, trainings on specific instruments and assessment protocols, presentation of patient-data, and journal club. Finally, there will be at least 30 minutes each week allotted to the management of clinical data from the externs\u2019 psychotherapy patients (see below).   The NYU CCE has an active, clinical research program, studying processes and outcomes of psychotherapy with 9/11 first responders. Externs have the unique opportunity to use multiple assessment methods, including video recording and both patient and clinician-report measures of psychotherapy process, to focus closely on each session. These processes are examined in relation to patient outcome variables (e.g., PTSD symptoms) to promote improved treatment outcomes and the development of externs\u2019 clinical skills. The ideal extern for this placement is interested in a) learning to be not just a sophisticated consumer, but producer, of clinical research which can inform treatment b) examining his/her clinical work in detail, and c) thoughtfully integrating active ingredients and common elements from a range of orientations/modalities.   Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture (PSOT)   The Bellevue/NYU Program for Survivors of Torture provides comprehensive medical and mental health care, as well as social and legal services to survivors of torture and war traumas and their family members. In the past year alone we provided these multidisciplinary services to more than 700 people from 70 countries.   Since its inception in 1995, the Program has developed an international reputation for excellence in our clinical, educational and research activities. Our mission is to assist individuals and families subjected to torture and war trauma to re-build health, self-sufficient lives and to contribute knowledge and testimony to global efforts to end torture.   Bellevue/NYU PSOT is dedicated to providing high-level training in the treatment of trauma to qualified doctoral students. The Program\u2019s multidisciplinary staff provides training and supervision in assessing and treating severely traumatized patients, addressing issues of refugee and war trauma, and providing care that is culturally relevant and appropriate. In terms of psychological services, the PSOT provides individual and group therapy for patients of all ages.   Each extern will carry individual psychotherapy cases, which may require an interpreter to be used in session. Individual therapy modalities available at the program include psychodynamic, supportive, and trauma focused cognitive-behavioral treatment. Many patients in the program are in the process of applying for political asylum, so externs often have an opportunity to write a report in support of this application and testify in immigration court. Externs receive an hour of supervision for their individual cases, and extra supervision on an as-needed basis. Externs present a case twice during the year at the externship\u2019s and the trauma-track\u2019s didactics.   Group therapy opportunities are also available for externs, depending on scheduling and patient needs. Two types of groups are offered at PSOT: short-term, psycho-educational groups and long-term, supportive groups for survivors of torture. Some groups currently running at the Program are two Tibetan survivors groups, a French-speaking African survivors group, a group for English-speaking African male survivors, a group for survivors persecuted due to their sexual orientation, and a more general ongoing group for English speaking survivors.   Finally, externs will conduct weekly intake evaluations with patients who are first presenting to the program. Intake evaluations involve a comprehensive interview, including a trauma history and mental status exam. After the interview, the extern formulates a diagnosis and a set of recommendations for the case. This information is presented to a multidisciplinary team at one of our weekly intake conferences to determine if the patient will be admitted into the program or referred to another agency.   Time Commitment   Sixteen hours per week are required with mandatory Friday attendance.   If you are particularly interested in working in the NYU CCE, you must also be available on Thursdays.   Applicant Qualifications   Open to graduate students enrolled in Ph.D. or Psy.D. programs in Clinical, Clinical-School, or Counseling Psychology who are in their third year or beyond. Prior externship experience is required, with preference given to applicants who have had experience in conducting psychotherapy, as well as conducting outpatient intake interviews and Mental Status Exams, and working with traumatized patients. Bilingual English/French and English/Spanish-speaking candidates are strongly encouraged to apply, as are other applicants with foreign language fluency.   Additional Required Application Materials:   PLEASE NOTE: \u00a0Each applicant may apply to only one placement site (NYU CCE or PSOT)   Please indicate your preferred placement in your cover letter.\u00a0 Applications without this information will not be considered.
