The interview will ultimately determine whether or not you will be offered employment. There are countless occasions where applicants with extremely impressive resumes are rejected in favor of applicants with run-of-the-mill resumes, simply because of their interview performance.        Interview Basics     Research the organization   Think critically about the skills and experiences you can contribute to the role   Practice your interviewing skills during a mock interview with a career coach   Dress professionally   Bring copies of your resume and a list of professional references     Tools to Practice Interviewing     Acing the Interview Seminar   Mock interviews with a career coach   BigInterview*   InterviewStream*     *Accessible on NYU CareerNet in the Resources tab.        Networking   Networking is a process through which we develop and maintain relationships with professionals in order to solicit information, advice and referrals that will facilitate the job search. It will be one of your most valuable job search tools. Maintain a list of people with whom you are in contact, including peers, relatives, professors, and past employers. This may open up many avenues for information that can lead to job openings.
