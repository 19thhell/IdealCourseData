The majority of entering freshmen are in the top 10% of their class.                  Diversity (Undergraduate)      Our undergraduate student body continues to be increasingly diverse. At NYU, the student body has no ethnic majority. In 2002, international students made up 4% of the total, and in 2012, that grew to 12% . The 2013 freshman class is 18% international from a record-breaking 87 countries .      All 50 states are represented in the undergraduate student body.      In 2012, African American and Latino/a students made up 19% of the freshman class, up from 11% in 2002.      In 2013, 17% of the freshman class are first-generation college students.                                                              Financial Aid (Institutional Aid)      Institutional aid for undergraduates has increased by almost 138% between 2002 and 2012 (from $78,138,160 to $185,828,888), while aid for all students (undergraduate, graduate and PhD students) increased by 134% between 2002 and 2012.                      In 2002, the average aid award for new freshmen was $8,960, which covered 34% of tuition . In 2012, the average aid award for new freshmen was $23,721 and covered 55% of tuition . The difference comes from increases in financial aid and investing financial aid in a way that awards aid to students who need it most.                  Financial Aid (Pell Grants)      Pell grants, in dollar terms, increased by 142% between 2002 and 2011 (from $8,648,286 to $20,896,467 ). Pell is an important metric of economic diversity. The freshman Pell Grant population at Yale is 13%, at Johns Hopkins, 12%, at Princeton, 11%, and at Tufts, 10%. The Pell Grant population among all students at NYU is 22%.                      Percentage of NYU Students Who Receive Pell Grants Compared to Other Institutions                               According to the Institute of International Education\u2019s annual Open Doors Survey, NYU sends more students abroad than any other university, ranking number one for the last ten years. (The IIE survey counts all study-abroad experiences, including those that are shorter than a full semester.)               Study Abroad (Undergraduate)      The number of undergraduates studying abroad for a semester or more has almost doubled from 2002 to 2013.                      In 2002 we had 5 Global Academic Centers. Today we have 13 NYU locations away from New York, including our degree-granting campuses in Abu Dhabi and Shanghai.                  Class Size      65% of classes have less than 20 students . This percentage has been stable for 10 years even with an increasing student body. The number of sections with 50 or more students has declined from 10 to 9 percent .                  Areas of Study      Over 40 areas of study have been added at the Undergraduate level.

The vast majority were either renovations of existing space or newly acquired space that replaced leased space. University capital investments over the past 10 years have been funded from a combination of university borrowing, philanthropy and working capital funds generated from operations .           Academic Investments      There was $905 million invested in academic capital improvements across nine schools between 2002 and 2011.
