The literature thus makes visible what political rhetoric and canonical political thought typically make invisible - the centrality of race and gender in the formation of nationhood and operation of politics, but also the deep narrative forms structuring the culture as well as ideas of &quot;America.&quot; Our goal, then, is to compare prevailing forms of political speech, theories of politics, and American literary art: How do literary artists narrate nationhood? How do they retell the stories that Americans tell themselves about themselves? What is the difference between a fiction that dramatizes a world, and a treatise that makes an argument about it? What can literary art do that theory cannot? How does that art re-orient people toward the assumptions, practices, and tropes that rule their world? To pursue these questions we read Herman Melville\u2019s Moby Dick and Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved, while surrounding each text with typical political speech and canonical political theory.

Description       The premise of this course is that there is no great political philosophy in the American tradition\u2014the Federalist Papers do not rival Plato or Marx\u2014but that profound thinking about politics does occur\u2014in the literary art of Melville, Faulkner, Ellison, Mailer, and Morrison among others. Moreover, formally &quot;political\u201d writers, like Madison and Hamilton, present a world that seems antithetical to the world presented by, say, Melville and Morrison: one depicts rational bargaining and self-interested contracts among men in markets and legislatures, whereas the other depicts racial and sexual violence, rape and slavery, in claustrophobic domestic spaces or in nature on frontiers. One depicts rationality and progress, the other madness and tragedy. The literature thus makes visible what is made invisible by prevailing forms of political science and American political thought, not only the constitutive power of race, gender, and sex, but also the deep narrative forms structuring the culture. We therefore ask several basic questions. First, what accounts for this difference and how shall we understand it? Second, what can we learn about (American) political life if we read literature as a form of political theory? But third, do we lose what is precious about literary art if we reduce it to an argument about politics? Or is the literary/aesthetic character of a work\u2014the ways it uses language and narrative to create both ambiguity and meaning\u2014an important part of what it can teach us about politics and political theorizing? To pursue these questions we focus on Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s\u00a0 Democracy in America \u00a0, Herman Melville\u2019s\u00a0 Moby Dick \u00a0, and Toni Morrison\u2019s\u00a0 Playing in the Dark \u00a0and\u00a0 Beloved \u00a0.
