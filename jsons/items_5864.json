They have written a clear, concise guide to scientific proposal writing that captures the essence of the scientific enterprise.\u201d (Essential reading for all beginning PhD students, March 9, 2000)    Reviewer: Andrew Richardson from New Haven, CT  Writing a PhD prospectus can be pretty intimidating. Where do you start? What do you include? What do you not include? This little book has the answers, and it has been an enormous help to me as I write my own proposal. Friedland and Folt's book is very clear and well-written, and full of practical information on how to write a clear, concise, and exciting proposal. Exercises along the way help to guide you step-by-step through the whole thought process. With this book in hand, writing a prospectus almost seems easy! This book should be sent to all first-year students, along with their registration materials.

A good scientific writer can explain his data more clearly and effectively, and make it easier for the readers to appreciate the importance of his findings. What are the tricks? Here is a reading list containing several books and websites that deal with effective scientific writing.     A. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Books:     The Elements of Style   by William Strunk, Jr and E.B.  Publisher: Longman; 4th edition (1999)  Avg Customer Rating: 4.5 (out of 5; 350 reviews)  Price: ~$10 (new).     Editorial Reviews:  White is a marvelous little book that you must have. Now in its fourth edition, this small book has become a classic. Postive reveiws include: \u201cA masterpiece in the art of clear and concise writing.\u201d ( Amazon.com Review ). &quot;No book in shorter space, with fewer words, will help any writer more than this persistent little volume.&quot; ( The Boston Globe ). &quot;Buy it, study it, enjoy it. It's as timeless as a book can be in our age of volubility.&quot; ( The New York Times ). &quot;Should be the daily companion of anyone who writes for a living, and for that matter, anyone who writes at all.&quot; ( Greensboro, N.C., Daily News ). Readers\u2019 comments include, \u201cI read it again whenever I am about to begin a large writing project.\u201d \u201cMany professional writers advise reading this book cover-to-cover once a year.\u201d \u201cThe book begins with eleven &quot;Elementary Rules of Usage,&quot; and then continues with eleven more &quot;Elementary Rules of Composition,&quot; and eleven &quot;Matters of Form.&quot; Each is presented as a brief statement followed by another sentence or two of explanation and a few clarifying examples. This amazing compilation fills only thirty-eight pages, yet covers ninety percent of good writing fundamentals. My favorite section is Chapter IV, a twenty-seven-page, alphabetical listing of commonly misused words and expressions. Here's a trade secret: when my manuscript is &quot;done,&quot; I then turn to this chapter and use my word processor's Find function to study every instance of all these problematic words and phrases. I never fail to find errors this way. Many great writers are so only because they've learned to make use of the best available tools. The end of the book contains an essay on &quot;An Approach to Style&quot; with a list of twenty-one &quot;Reminders.&quot; Those who fight the apparently-natural tendency to go against these recommendations succeed as writers. Those who don't, fail. It's that simple.\u201d Personally I think this little book covers some exceeding important and effective rules, that are unfortunately ignored too often in scientific writing, such as \u201cAs a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence\u201d (rule no. 9); \u201cA participal phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject\u201d (rule no. 7); or \u201cuse the active voice\u201d (rule no. 11). Although this book is available free in its entirety online , I strongly encourage you to purchase a hardcopy from Amazon.com or other sources.

Of special note: The book contains a full-length paper for readers to evaluate and revise in accordance with the book; book's principles and guidelines.      Sample Readers\u2019 comments  \u201cThis is an exceptional book. It walks the reader through all stages of writing a biomedical paper, and exemplifies the saying that &quot;clear writing means clear thinking&quot;. Even after having written or co-written perhaps 40 biomedical papers and grants, I found this book an eye-opener. I've worked with some excellent writers and re-writers on biomed papers, but Zeiger's book lays out for all of us what some top writers may do by instinct. She starts with word choice, sentence structure, then alternative paragraph structures. She practically shows you the nature of language and thought. She goes through the right way to produce biomed papers - if you ever thought the great, efficient writers had a rule book -you- never got, THIS is the rule book. If you ever had an introduction that sounded like the abstract, or a results sections that was unwieldy, or a discussion section that seemed to repeat the introduction - Zeiger lays out the hidden rules that most people would want to follow. Following her rules, from sentence to paragraph to section, creates a paper that invokes an instinctive sense of clarity in the reader. Many times I had the &quot;Aha!&quot; feeling. The book should be very useful for all kinds of clear writing, including research grants. I never took one of those &quot;scientific writing&quot; classes because I felt smart and fluent and the classes seemed pedestrian. If those classes had used this book, I would have been way ahead to have discovered this information twenty years ago.\u201d  Click here for a preview of the book.

Matthews and Janice R. Matthews  Spiral-bound: 256 pages  Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 3 edition (November 5, 2007)  Avg. Customer Rating: 4.5 (out of 5; 9 reviews)  Price: $33 (new)     Editorial Review  'This book is beyond reproach and should be regarded as compulsory reading for all biomedical and science undergraduate and postgraduate students and all others likely to have to write or edit scientific reports.' Times Higher Education Supplement\u2028\u2028'... very well organized and easy to scan for useful tips ... will soon become one of the more well-thumbed volumes on our laboratory bookshelf.' Trends in Neuroscience\u2028\u2028'... pragmatic, well-written and comprehensive ... each stage - from marshalling ideas through bashing out a first draft, revising it, honing it for publication and correcting it in proof - is demystified with exercises and examples.' New Scientist\u2028\u2028'...does not disappoint. It is everything a 'How to' book needs to be, stuffed with plain common sense and sprinkled with useful tips.' The Biologist\u2028         Product Description  The detailed, practical, step-by-step advice in this user-friendly guide will help students and researchers to communicate their work more effectively through the written word. Covering all aspects of the writing process, this concise, accessible resource is critically acclaimed, well-structured, comprehensive, and entertaining. Self-help exercises and abundant examples from actual typescripts draw on the authors' extensive experience working both as researchers and with them. Whilst retaining the user-friendly and pragmatic style of earlier editions, this third edition has been updated and broadened to incorporate such timely topics as guidelines for successful international publication, ethical and legal issues including plagiarism and falsified data, electronic publication, and text-based talks and poster presentations. With advice applicable to many writing contexts in the majority of scientific disciplines, this book is a powerful tool for improving individual skills and an eminently suitable text for classroom courses or seminars.         Sample Reader Comments  \u201cThis is a funny, well-written, thorough, and authoritative book that goes through every step in the process of creating a journal article, including some topics unique to this process, like how to deal with multi-author editing, peer review, and lit searches. Lots of great advice about how to overcome writer's block. Although the book is written with biomedical science in mind, the advice on grammar, style, structure, and process management is useful to all technical writers. No scientist should be without it.\u201d    \u201cIn my view, the crux of the book appears in chapters 5, 6 and 7 in which extraordinarily lucid and practical instructions and exercises are presented for improving one's ability to write scientifically.\u201d    \u201cThe exercises provided would be great student assignments. Additionally the exercises are fun and enhance points made in the text. Matthews, et al have given us a guide that is appropriate for advanced writers as well. Virtually every page has gems of wisdom or insights that will enhance the end result of scientific communication. This book may be especially helpful for those that are &quot;stuck&quot; in trying to get started writing or have complete &quot;writers block&quot;.\u201d    Click here for a preview, and check Amazon.com for additional Readers\u2019 Comments before you make a purchase decision.
