It trained at Celtic Park,      a nine acre athletic field on the Long Island City/Woodside border      in Queens. The Club was active until the First World War when Celtic      Park was sold to a developer for apartments.      Many IAAC members were champions or record-holders of the period.      Martin Sheridan (b. Bohola, Co. Mayo, 1881-d. New York City, 1918),      for example, won five Olympic, twelve national and more than thirty      Canadian and Metropolitan championships, setting sixteen world records      in a variety of field sports, including free and Greek style discus      throw, pole vault, standing broad and high jumps, and javelin throw.
