The Fellowship recognizes the strong commitment to public service that Fellows have demonstrated and strengthens this commitment by providing professional development and networking opportunities to help Fellows think intentionally and strategically about their own leadership and careers.   FELPS is one of the first programs that actively guides and engages emerging leaders in a process that encourages self-directed career development. This process encourages Fellows to explore the facets of public service most appealing to them while simultaneously presenting them with the exciting and challenging options that a modern-day public service career offers. The Fellowship is part of a broader commitment by the NYU Leadership Initiative and NYU Wagner to educate and prepare the next generation of public service leaders.   FELPS anchors next generation public service leaders by:   Inspiring Fellows to reconnect with their initial excitement and commitment to public service in their daily work and use that motivation as they advance their careers.   Engaging Fellows in a series of dynamic conversations and explorations that strengthen this commitment while challenging them to ask, \"What's next?\"   Connecting Fellows with leaders in public service, to make them aware of career paths they can take and to provide networking opportunities.   Providing Fellows with opportunities to reflect upon the experience as they shape their career development in an action-orientated manner.

Fellows will come together for a series of workshops two to three times each month on evenings and weekends to:   Hear from senior experts in the public service field about their own career trajectories and the leadership lessons they have learned along the way;   Gain a clear assessment of their own assets, knowledge base and skill set and evaluate how they can apply these in their current roles;   Develop a career plan based on personal assessments and professional goals; and\u00a0   Build a network of peers and mentors who can offer insight and guidance over the course of their careers.

Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Women have engaged and been represented in public service in America through their fearless Women's Suffrage movement to gain the right to vote, which officially began in the 19 th century, in 1848, during the Seneca Falls Convention , where the first women's rights convention, was held and was triumphantly realized in the early 20 th century After a hard-fought series of votes in the U.S. Congress and in state legislatures, when the Nineteenth Amendment became part of the U.S. Constitution on August 20, 1920. To date, however, it is recognized, the road to elected and appointed office for women leaders is not equitable for those seeking to serve in public office. Although women make up the majority of our American population, women are the majority of registered voters and women graduate college at higher rates than men from post secondary education institutions; women are only a fraction of our elected and appointed officials. Statistics, big data analytics tell the sobering story. This course will teach offerings which underscore \"Leadership, Women and Public Service in American Cities\" charting the course and exploring the experience of women and girls in public service leadership. We will examine the context of equity for women in the structural realities and gender attitudes within the American political and civic systems. Our students will connect with women leaders and advocates for women leaders; we will teach women\u2019s historic and contemporary participation in public service. Utilizing political and Intersection theory we will focus on trends, implications and impact of ethnicity, race, class, gender &amp; religion on women in politics and public service. Through coursework, guest speakers and hands-on activities students will learn how they can be a participant in and influence the public agenda through public service, politics and impacting public policy. The coursework will review leadership skills-set, career paths and analyze barriers that have traditionally kept women from achieving their political and leadership potential.
