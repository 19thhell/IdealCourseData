If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

Applicants cannot request an interview or an invitation to a Candidate Weekend/Day.   Application Review   If anything is missing from your application file, we will offer you a limited window in which to provide the outstanding information.

Applicants to NYU's New York Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU New York should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (for new freshmen and continuing students, to be considered for federal financial aid).   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE (to be considered for institutional [non-government] financial aid). The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is required for new undergraduate domestic students applying for the 2015-2016 academic year who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. It is not required for transfer applicants, returning undergraduate students, graduate students, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies.     The New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) grant application, for New York State residents only.   Students seeking financial aid for summer courses must also complete a NYU Summer Aid Application (available from February through July, see the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right).     Admission to NYU New York is need-blind for domestic applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the FAFSA, PROFILE and TAP applications.   International Students : NYU offers limited financial support in the form of institutional grants/scholarships to international freshmen admitted to our New York campus beginning with the Fall 2013 term. Grants/scholarships will be based upon a combination of financial need and academic merit. Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for institutional financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU New York campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU New York is need-aware for international applicants; New York University will consider a family's financial need as reported on the PROFILE when evaluating the student's application for admission.   New York Undocumented Students : Individuals applying for admission as an undocumented undergraduate student may be eligible for NYU scholarship funds. To be considered, please submit:     The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   The Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (available beginning in October, see the Applications and Forms menu at right).     Please read more information about New York Undocumented Students .   Applicants to NYU's Abu Dhabi Campus   Domestic and International students : All students, regardless of citizenship status (except Emirati nationals), who are applying for admission ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi (that is, they do not wish to be considered for any other NYU campus) need to complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. (The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.) International students cannot apply for financial support after they are admitted. Admission to NYU Abu Dhabi is need-blind for all applicants, and financial support will be tailored for each individual family based upon the results of the PROFILE. Students applying ONLY to NYU Abu Dhabi are not required to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).   For more information please see NYU Abu Dhabi Financial Support .   Applicants to NYU's Shanghai Campus   Domestic Students : Students who are U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to NYU Shanghai should complete:     The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) (to be considered for federal financial aid).

International Students and Chinese Nationals : Students who are not U.S. citizens or eligible non-citizens and who wish to be considered for financial aid when applying for admission to the NYU Shanghai campus should complete ONLY the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE to be considered for institutional financial aid funds. The PROFILE is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test.

For more information please see Financial Aid at NYU Shanghai .              FAFSA, CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE and TAP     1. Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)   Students must submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for any federal financial aid funds. The FAFSA is a confidential fiinancial statement detailing information about your family\u2019s financial circumstances. When you have completed the form, you submit it directly to the U.S. Department of Education. Using a formula mandated by Congress, the U.S. Department of Education makes an evaluation of your family\u2019s financial strength and estimates the amount your family can contribute annually toward your educational expenses. The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.

If you are participating in a dual-enrollment program, you should apply as a freshman even if you will have earned enough college credits for an associate's degree upon completion of your program. If you have left high school early and are attending a college or university as a full-time student, you must apply as a transfer student.     All applicants must apply by submitting a Common Application online, which includes a Writing Supplement.          Key Dates and Deadlines  Application Type Application Deadline Financial Aid Deadline Notification Date   Early Decision I  November 1 November 15 December 15  Early Decision II  January 1 January 15 February 15  Regular Decision  January 1 February 15 April 1      Applicants to Tisch School of the Arts or Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development :   We recommend submitting the Common Application one month in advance for any program that requires an artistic review . This will allow you more time to prepare your portfolio or schedule an audition by the application deadline.              Applying for Early Decision at NYU   Philosophy and Process     NYU's Early Decision programs are binding agreements: if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer \u2013 roughly within 2-3 weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from filing any new applications as well. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is to provide an &quot;early&quot; decision, and as a result, we either admit or deny Early Decision candidates. Please note that Early Decision students who are denied admission may not re-apply as Regular Decision applicants.   Students applying for Early Decision admission must follow the same procedures and submit all of the same materials outlined on the instructions page of our website, including meeting any Additional Program Requirements for the student\u2019s school or college of interest.   Early Decision and Financial Aid   NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission.   For Early Decision candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS Profile application, administered by the College Board, to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package with their admissions decision. Students who are admitted during ED I must follow up by submitting the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be provided with their official financial aid award in late April.   Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.   Advantages and Disadvantages of Applying Early Decision   The biggest advantage to applying Early Decision is that if you are offered admission, your search process can be completed early and thus, reduce anxiety over the admission process. Our Early Decision programs are only binding if we are able to admit you to your primary school, college, program or campus of interest. If offered admission, you will have 25 days to respond to your offer of admission. You may not apply Early Decision for one campus and request to be considered under our Regular Decision for another campus. You will be considered for any and all campuses when you initially apply for admission.   Many students want to know if it is \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted through our Early Decision process. The reality is that no, it is not \u201ceasier\u201d to be admitted Early Decision, as the quantifiable criteria we use to evaluate candidates for admission \u2013 GPA and class rank (if available), test scores, etc. \u2013 is the same during both the Early and Regular Decision processes. That said, given the relatively small size of our Early Decision applicant pool, we are sometimes able to admit a larger percentage of our applicants during Early Decision. For our New York campus, however, our most recent admit rate was roughly 32% - both Early Decision and Regular Decision.

The Department of Education then sends your family\u2019s financial information and its estimate of family contribution to each college you designate to receive the information. (NOTE TO DENTAL STUDENTS: College of Dentistry students seeking certain federal education loans for the health professions (e.g. the Health Professions Student Loan [HPSL] and Loans for Disadvantaged Students [LDS]) must include parents financial data on the FAFSA even if they are financially independent of their parents.)   The FAFSA is available each year beginning January 1, and should be completed as soon as possible, but not later than February 15 (midnight EST) for new freshmen , and not later than May 1 (midnight EDT) for most other students (see Financial Aid Application Priority Deadlines at column upper right for details). Students who miss the FAFSA priority deadline are still encouraged to apply and will be considered for federal student aid, if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited.   Graduate students should refer to their school or department for specific program deadlines.     Click here to begin and submit the FAFSA . Alternatively, you can complete the paper version, which may be found in your high school or college or by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, and adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU Shanghai.     NOT REQUIRED for international students at NYU New York campus.   NOT REQUIRED for students at NYU Abu Dhabi.   NOT REQUIRED for international students and Chinese nationals at NYU Shanghai.   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our federal school code number 002785 when completing your FAFSA.     Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the FAFSA. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the FAFSA. You can make corrections later on the FAFSA website.     YOUR FAFSA PIN:  Students and parents of dependent students may use a PIN (Personal Identification Number) to sign the FAFSA electronically and avoid the need to print and mail a signature page. The PIN can be used each year to apply for federal student aid and to review your record online at the U.S. Department of Education. Get your Federal Student Aid PIN at www.pin.ed.gov .   FAFSA priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early and Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        FAFSA priority deadlines for Transfer applicants:         Fall/Summer Admission: April 1 (midnight EDT)    Spring Admission: November 1 (midnight EDT)           2. College Scholarship Service Financial Aid PROFILE   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application is administered by the College Scholarship Service (the financial aid division of The College Board) and collects information used by many private universities to award institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE can be submitted in the fall as early as October 1 , but not later than February 15 (midnight EST).       Click here to begin and submit the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE .   REQUIRED the first year for new undergraduate U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens applying to NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   NOT REQUIRED for U.S. citizen and eligible non-citizen returning undergraduate students, transfer students, and graduate students at NYU New York campus, or adult students applying to The Paul McGhee Division at the NYU School of Continuing and Professional Studies, New York campus.   REQUIRED every year for international students at NYU New York campus who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds.   REQUIRED every year for all students at NYU Abu Dhabi who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Emirati nationals, who will be automatically evaluated for Exceptional Emirati Scholarship upon acceptance.)   REQUIRED every year for international (not US, not Chinese nationals) students at NYU Shanghai who wish to be considered for institutional (non-government) financial aid funds. (NOTE: it is not required for Chinese nationals who complete the Gaokao college entrance examination instead of the SAT college admission test).   You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our CSS school code number 2785 when completing your CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE.   Do not wait until your taxes are done before submitting the PROFILE. Although it is better to do your taxes early, it is acceptable to use estimates of your income when you initially file the PROFILE.   NYU does not participate in the CSS IDOC program.   CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE Help: telephone 305-829-9793.     CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:         Early Decision I: November 15 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 15 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 15 (midnight EST)        College Scholarship Service Noncustodial PROFILE     The CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is also required, if applicable;     Students who have families with separated, divorced, or single parents must also complete the Non-Custodial Parent form, which complements the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE. NYU requires noncustodial parents to report their income, assets and other information as part of the financial aid application process to assess an applicant\u2019s eligibility for scholarship or other types of aid.   Providing such information does not necessarily mean that the student\u2019s noncustodial parent will be expected or required to contribute to educational costs.   Under certain circumstances NYU will consider waiving the requirement for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE in the event the information cannot be obtained. Please see the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE Waiver Request form available (October to February) on the Applications and Forms menu in the column at right.   If the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE is required but not submitted, and NYU does not grant the applicant a waiver of this requirement, the student will not be considered for need-based NYU scholarship or grant funds. Please note that this is important because the amount of scholarship a student receives in their first year at NYU is typically the amount they will continue to receive each year if they remain otherwise eligible. Thus, if a student does not receive any NYU grant or scholarship in their freshman year they will likely not receive any in subsequent years. Failing to submit the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE (or the waiver request) for the first year can therefore affect eligibility in future years.     CSS Noncustodial PROFILE priority deadlines for Freshmen applicants:           Early Decision I: November 20 (midnight EST)    Early Decision II: January 20 (midnight EST)    Regular Decision: February 20 (midnight EST)        Please note that the deadlines for the CSS Noncustodial PROFILE application occur 5 days after the corresponding deadlines for the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE application to allow additional time to provide the information required.             3. NYS Tuition Assistance Program (TAP)   In addition to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), New York State residents must also submit an application for the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP). TAP grants are available to qualified students attending New York University.    Start the TAP application process by completing the FAFSA at http://www.fafsa.gov/ . New York State will use your FAFSA information as part of your application for TAP; you can link to the online TAP application directly from the FAFSA on the Web confirmation page.    You will be asked to establish a PIN (Personal Identification Number) for TAP. The TAP PIN will allow you complete your application online, keep track of your application information, or make changes later. Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-filled on your TAP on the Web application. Follow the instructions provided.       You must list &quot;New York University&quot; as a recipient and include our state school code number 0555 when completing your TAP application.     If you choose not to apply online, an Express TAP Application (ETA) will be mailed to you by the New York State Higher Education Services Corporation (HESC). Information from your FAFSA and your family's calculated NYS net taxable income will be pre-printed on your ETA. Review this information, change any incorrect items, complete any missing items, then SIGN AND MAIL THE FORM USING THE RETURN ENVELOPE.    If you provide an e-mail address on your FAFSA, HESC will use that address to contact you about your TAP application, give you processing updates, or award information. Please respond to any requests or instructions sent by HESC. If you have submitted applications, you can check the status of your TAP at any time.    If you have already received TAP, you must renew your grant each year by returning to TAP on the Web (via the online FAFSA process) to review and confirm your HESC data. You must submit the FAFSA for each academic year to continue your TAP eligibility. Based upon the data reported on your FAFSA, you will receive confirmation from HESC about your grant eligibility and award. Be sure to verify that all information is accurate, and submit any necessary corrections immediately.                                                         Priority Dates and Deadlines   All students should apply for financial aid every year. Students who miss a financial aid priority deadline are still encouraged to file the FAFSA and will be considered for federal student aid if eligible, but funds become increasingly limited. If you have not applied, do so immediately . Remember, to meet the specified deadline your application, with all necessary signatures, must be received and validated by the processor and released to NYU by the date shown below for priority consideration.   Freshman Applicants: In order to be considered for NYU scholarship, you must complete all required applications by our deadlines . Please review the Applications and Forms section of this website to find out which applications are relevant to you. Late CSS Profile applications will not be accepted for scholarship consideration.
