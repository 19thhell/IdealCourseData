U.S. visa policy can be found at http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/visit.html . Information about applying for a visa is available at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where the visa application will be made ( http://usembassy.state.gov/ ). Applications will need to show that the visit to the U.S. is temporary, that there are adequate finances to cover the trip, and that they intend to return to their home country (proof of ties such as job, family, property or other commitments).   You might need to send supporting evidence for your guest:     A letter of invitation from you in English to your guest. Include the guest\u2019s name, your relationship to the visitor, the length and dates of the visit, and the purpose, e.g. to attend Commencement. In some countries or if your guest has a common name, including the person\u2019s birth date and passport number may help the embassy verify that the letter is for your guest. If your guests are staying with you and will not need a hotel, state this in your letter to help demonstrate financial support for the trip.   A letter from the Office of the University Registrar verifying your graduation status and Commencement date. You must have applied to graduate prior to requesting the letter. Complete a request form at the Office of the University Registrar, Student Services Center, 25 West 4th Street, 1st floor, or send a written request to Graduation Services, P.O. Box 910, New York, NY 10276-0910, fax 212-995-4558. (Students from Law, Dentistry, Medicine or Stern Graduate, please contact your individual school\u2019s Registrar\u2019s Office .) The request must include your name, ID number, email address, phone number, school, anticipated degree, and number of copies requested (we recommend 1 copy for each international guest). The letter will be available for you to pick up from the Student Services Center within 5 business days of receipt of the request.   If you are an international student, evidence of your visa status may be helpful.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.

U.S. visa policy can be found at http://travel.state.gov/content/visas/english/visit.html . Information about applying for a visa is available at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate where the visa application will be made ( http://usembassy.state.gov/ ). Applications will need to show that the visit to the U.S. is temporary, that there are adequate finances to cover the trip, and that they intend to return to their home country (proof of ties such as job, family, property or other commitments).   You might need to send supporting evidence for your guest:     A letter of invitation from you in English to your guest. Include the guest\u2019s name, your relationship to the visitor, the length and dates of the visit, and the purpose, e.g. to attend Commencement.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.
