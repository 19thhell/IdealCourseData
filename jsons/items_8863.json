Seminar on Greek and Roman Art and Architecture                 The Seminar on Greek and Roman Art and Architecture invites scholars to share their current research with the research community on Ancient Art and Archaeology at the Institute of Fine Arts and in the metropolitan area, and to meet and talk with IFA graduate students. The study of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture is at a critical stage in its development. In recent years, this field has been characterized by an ever-increasing range of approaches, under the influence of various disciplines such as Sociology, Semiotics, Gender Theory, Anthropology, Reception Theory, and Hermeneutics.

Points of Contact: New Approaches in Islamic Art                 Over the past decades, the study of Islamic material culture has been marked by increased scholarly attention to transcultural dimensions of art, architecture and archaeology. This interest coincides with an interest in histories of mobility generated by contemporary discourses of the global. It has taken a variety of forms, from attention to the modalities and effects of circulation - the result of diplomatic exchange and gifting, long-distance trade, or looting and reuse, for example - to research on media and regions that lie on the margins of the Islamic world, or outside the traditional boundaries of the canon. Points of Contact introduces some of the exciting new scholarship generated by these developments.           Click here for more information.

In recent years, this field has been characterized by an ever-increasing range of approaches, under the influence of various disciplines such as Sociology, Semiotics, Gender Theory, Anthropology, Reception Theory, and Hermeneutics. The scope of this Seminar is to explore key aspects of Greek and Roman Art and Architecture, and to assess the current state of the discipline by reviewing and subjecting its current larger theoretical implications, methodologies, and directions of research to critical scrutiny.

Points of Contact: New Approaches in Islamic Art                 Over the past decades, the study of Islamic material culture has been marked by increased scholarly attention to transcultural dimensions of art, architecture and archaeology. This interest coincides with an interest in histories of mobility generated by contemporary discourses of the global. It has taken a variety of forms, from attention to the modalities and effects of circulation - the result of diplomatic exchange and gifting, long-distance trade, or looting and reuse, for example - to research on media and regions that lie on the margins of the Islamic world, or outside the traditional boundaries of the canon. Points of Contact introduces some of the exciting new scholarship generated by these developments.           Click here for more information.
