Students learn how to create 3D interactive content using Maya and Virtools . The class allows students to experiment with the optics of the eye, the acoustics of spaces, and screen displays in order to create original content and installations. Students will explore and create virtual spaces using hybrid media including video, 3D sculptures, light, particles, music, text, graphics, animation and interactivity. Students learn how to create interactions between viewers and virtual spaces. The virtual spaces created in this class allow    - to be immersed inside the four dimensions of a virtual space    - to play with behavioral engines controlling several media: visuals, music, voice, animation, MIDI and live video processing behaviors using Max MSP and Jitter    - to communicate with other groups of people located in remote places through telepresence    Other topics covered in class include: virtual simulations of physical spaces using light, sound and physics; alternative storytelling: involving the non-linear approach; emerging topics in virtual reality including artificial intelligence and autonomous characters. Students will prepare weekly assignments and a final project where individuals can enter, immerse themselves, play and work in a virtual space.
