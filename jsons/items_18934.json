The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

The arts curriculum includes more than 20 different workshops each semester in music, dance, theater, the visual arts, architecture and design. Outside of the classroom, students may intern in arts agencies and performance companies and study at various private studios in New York City. Annually, the arts program sponsors the Gallatin Arts Festival , a weeklong, community-wide celebration of the artistry of students at the Gallatin School. Located at Gallatin, the Gallatin Galleries provide a yearlong venue for the exhibition of art work by students, faculty and working artists. The Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts is a small, black box theater showcasing student performances and other productions during the academic year. Gallatin also houses a rehearsal room for dance and other performance and an arts studio for painting, drawing, and architectural design.

Students in New York and Buenos Aires meet simultaneously via video conference and work from the same syllabus. Before spring break Prof. Velasco will lead the Washington Square section in New York, and Prof. Malbran the Buenos Aires section in Argentina. After spring break, the instructors will switch locations, so students in both sites will have personal contact with Profs. Velasco and Malbran. No prior GIS experience is necessary. Students will receive training on mapping software and portable mapping devices, which will be provided. Due to enrollment limits, only students who intend to stay in the class are asked to register. Please direct any questions to Alejandro Velasco (av48@nyu.edu) before registration.

                                                Our Vision   To establish a world class cyber security center by partnering with key local universities, industry and government agencies in order to facilitate cyber security research, education and practice in the UAE and more generally in the GCC region. The center will act as a catalyst to improve cyber security in the UAE and enhance its regional and global competitiveness in this field.                                                              UAE Cyber Security Day - 2015                                                    The UAE has one of the most advanced ICT infrastructures in the region, as well as a high number of high-tech organizations and enterprises.   However, advanced ICT infrastructures are the most vulnerable to threats and to the continuously changing advances in cyber-crime and cyber-warfare. The need for UAE original research in information and cyber-security is therefore increasingly recognized.   The 2nd UAE Cyber Security Day will put together top researchers and institutions working in the Cyber Security research area from across the country. It is hosted by KUSTAR Center for Cyber Security Research (CCSR), and organized in collaboration with NYUAD.                                 Goals   In accordance with its vision CRISSP-AD has identified a number of goals in three main areas:   Research     CRISSP-AD will build the capacity needed for high impact research programs in cyber security and execute multidisciplinary research in security and privacy that has both scholarly merit, and practical applications that will be commercialized. Collaborative research will be conducted by NYU and partner university faculty, and a core group of on-site researchers in Abu Dhabi, including research professors, postdocs and graduate students, in partnership with industry and government agencies.     Education     CRISSP-AD will help partner institutions and agencies establish cyber security educational and training programs to address the region\u2019s shortage of trained cyber security professionals. In carrying out its outreach activities, the center will organize conferences, workshops and awareness programs. The center will also create mechanisms to share educational offerings and knowledge resources among its partners.     Outreach and Broader Engagement     CRISSP-AD will serve as a regional hub that endeavors to engage with the broader community and become the source of cyber security expertise for government and local industry. It will also develop partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions around the world to facilitate, promote, and coordinate joint education and research programs that have global impact.
