How can reading literary and scientific texts alongside one   another shape our understanding of the boundaries between humanistic and   scientific inquiry? This course will consider major renaissance epics   and romances as worldmaking documents. Text with include Dante's   Inferno, Ariosto's Orlando Gurioso, Spenser's Faerie Queene and Milton's   Paradis Lost. We will read these words in light of Renaissance thinking   about space and spatiality including selections from Plato, Ortelius,   Copernicus, and Kepler. Junior Theory Seminar: What do we mean by Subjectivity? Basterra      We like to  think of ourselves as free: freedom would seem to be a horizon toward we are  intimately oriented. We like to consider  ourselves autonomous subjects with initiative and the ability to act in the  world. But isn\u2019t subjectivity  constituted in relationship to what is other?    The subject of vision in painting, the one who sees, emerges in relation  to the object being seen; the voice speaking in a poem and calling itself \u2018I\u2019  becomes a subject in the act of addressing a \u2018you\u2019; the self-conscious subject  reflects on itself by taking itself for another; the ethical subject is chosen  and called. It is perhaps surprising,  however, to think of the very freedom which (we hope) defines our sameness as  something other. This seminar explores  the counterintuitive relationship of subjectivity to freedom, and of freedom to  action, establishing a conversation between philosophical texts by Kant, Hegel,  Deleuze, Nancy and Levinas, and a range of literary and artistic works.  Topics in 18th Century Literature: Comparative Melancholies Gadberry      Twentieth- and  twenty-first-century thinkers looked back to the seventeenth and eighteenth  centuries as they theorized the black dog dogging modernity: melancholy. Our  course will return to these earlier texts, putting early modern, Enlightenment,  and Romantic literatures in conversation with modern and post-modern  psychoanalytic, philosophical, and political-theoretical works. Our course will  be both formal and historical. We will ask how our primary texts understand  (and create) structures of melancholy and how these texts communicate the  losses we cannot avow. And we\u2019ll also examine how varying forms of melancholy  have shaped our subjectivities and societies as we study a history of  melancholy coinciding with and subtending modernity\u2019s origins \u2013 a history that  includes the emergence of the modern nation-state, of the colony, and of capital.      Our seventeenth- and  eighteenth-century texts will include: Shakespeare, Hamlet; Burton, The Anatomy  of Melancholy (selections); Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Charles Brockden Brown,  Wieland; Claire de Durfort Duras, Ourika; Goethe, The Sorrows of Young Werther;  and poems by Coleridge, Blair, Young, Keats, and others. Among our modern  readings will be works by Freud, Lacan, Benjamin, Butler, Fanon, Brown, Klein,  Kristeva, and others.      Topics: Transnational America Garcia Beginning with Randolph Bourne's \"Trans-National America\" (1916), this course examines different transnational and globalized conceptions of \"America\" across literature and criticism from both the twentieth century and twenty-first century. We consider transnational American literatures not only for the different meanings they attach to \"America,\" but also for the divergent moments of literary, cultural and intellectual history they reveal. Much of the course is devoted to the interventions of critics such as Bourne, W.E.B. Du Bois, Alain Locke, whose writings we examine in terms of literary-theoretical resonances with works by Jean Toomer, Willa Cather, Henry James, Nella Larsen, Teju Cole and Joseph O'Neill, among others.  Readings in Comtemporary Literary Theory: Image Iampolski      The course is designed to introduce students to the  theoretical framework of modern thinking about images. Images mediate our  relations with the world and are responsible for the primordial elaboration of  meaning from the surrounding chaotic complexity. We will start with biological  evolution and the emergence of vision and the unparalleled variety of striking  appearances in living beings that emerged around the famous Cambrian explosion.  We will use the data provided by cognitive sciences to understand the  anthropological role of images, the use of images in cults and rituals. Special  attention will be paid to the emergence of art and to its modern developments  in photography and contemporary media. We will discuss the role of images in  the rise and transformations of modern subjectivity. The social role of images  in modern society will be surveyed. The readings will include among others many  influential thinkers and scholars such as Jakob von Uexk\u00fcll, Heidegger,  Merleau-Ponty, Kracauer, Benjamin, Foucault, Panofsky, Gombrich, Marion,  Didi-Huberman etc. Topics in 20th Century Literature: Literature &amp; the Figure of the Disappeared in Spain and the Southern Cone Matos-Martin     In the twentieth century, Spain  and many countries in Latin America have shared the common experience of  dictatorship. In this course, we will explore representations of the traumatic  dictatorial histories in Spain and the countries of the Southern Cone, focusing  primarily on the figure of the \u201cdesaparecido\u201d in Spanish Civil War and the  early years of the Franco regime, Argentina\u2019s \u201cdirty war\u201d and Pinochet\u2019s  dictatorship in Chile. Taking a comparative approach, we will study literary  and visual sources such as short stories, novels, poems, painting, fiction  films or documentaries, and we will examine topics such as the politics of  memory, fascism, political disappearance, war, resistance or violence. Some  authors and filmmakers whose works we might engage include Alberto M\u00e9ndez,  Luisa Valenzuela, Andr\u00e9s Wood, Marco Bechis, Guillermo del Toro, Agust\u00edn  Villaronga, Pablo Picasso, Pablo Neruda, Rafael Alberti, Jorge Sempr\u00fan,  Patricio Guzm\u00e1n, Juan Gelman, Roberto Bola\u00f1o and Gast\u00f3n Birab\u00e9n. Primary  materials will be paired with texts by leading cultural and political thinkers  working on questions of memory, fascism, terror and violence. Intro to Comp Lit: Classic Screw-Ups and Epic Fails: From Faust To Kathy Acker &amp; Dennis Cooper Ronell      The course aims to introduce some  thrilling aspects of reading and thinking in the void of achievement. We will  explore the way literature exemplarily treats and exposes snags, flaws,  addictive roller coaster itineraries, sexual confusion, rhetorical static,  material abuse and gender trouble, permanent identity crises, the intrusive  disruption of life\u2019s narrative, forms of destructive pleasure, failing health  and other disturbances that inflect the way we write and think and truck.  Staying close to the texts in question, we will locate philosophical  predicaments, cover-ups and inflations with which literature regularly  contends, if according to covert maneuvers. All the while learning how to  deconstruct, we will consider the way Stupidity insinuates itself into themes  of knowing, evades our cognitive scanners and becomes the uncanny double of mastery  or intelligence. Promised: By the end of the class, you will have been able to  comprehend this course description. Prepare to be reset! Topics in Film &amp; Literatue: Documents, Documentary, Fiction Vatulescu      What do we mean by document,  documentary, and fiction? How have these concepts and their relationships  changed through time? This course starts by considering the beginnings of  documentary in literature, film, and the visual arts, from the controversial  coining of the term in 1926. We will explore representative works from  foundational moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel,  Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression era documentary books, the  cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary  films. How has the emergence of this new term and its development affected our  other key concepts\u2014document and fiction? What is the relationship between  documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography,  cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist,  indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in  the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other  uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics  are 1) word/image relations and 2) the archive. Theoretical forays around and  into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in the Tamiment  archive or in an archive of your choice.    Senior Seminar in Comparative Literature: Honors Thesis Vatulescu This seminar, limited to senior Comparative Literature majors engaged in writing a senior honors thesis, is designed to be a writing workshop. Students will articulate and research a thesis topic, identify an appropriate critical approach and methodology, and write at least one chapter of their thesis. Periodical writing installments give the students the opportunity to receive feed-back from their peers and instructor as well as to learn to critique others' work-in-progress. Permission of the DUGS is required to enroll in the course. Students must also have a 3.65 or better GPA, both overall and in the major.

COLIT-UA 998         Course Descriptions  Readings in Contemporary Lit: The form of Planetary Criticism/Death Drive/Aesthetics of Catastrophe Apter This   course will examine theories of the death drive in the aesthetics of   catastrophism drawing on classic texts by Freud, Italo Svevo, Melanie   Klein, Lacan, Georges Bataille and Marguerite Duras, as well as recent   work on worlds as places of catastrophe, dystopia, planetary dysphoria   (depression), and earthly extinction (Ray Brassier\u2019s \u201cnihil unbound,\u201d   Eugene Thacker\u2019s \u201cdark pantheism\u201d). The aim will be to emphasize   psychical processes in diagnoses of planetarity, while trying to avoid a   heavy-handed reliance on allegories of World System or the Planet or   Capital that impute subjective personalities to political entities and   geographic phantasms. We will experiment with an \u201cecology\u201d of what   Melanie Klein called \u201cthe depressive position,\u201d as it suffuses every   aspect of everyday life.   Readings in Contemporary Lit: Feminist Theory and Philosophy  Bianchi In   this course we will address key texts and debates in feminist and   gender theory. We will consider various theoretical foundations -   Marxism, psychoanalysis, structuralism \u2013 that have informed feminist   politics and thought, and focus on conflicts within feminism emerging   along lines of class, race, and sexual and gender identity. The course   will examine feminist approaches to knowledge and power, in particular   feminist/queer approaches to pornography, sexuality and sex work in a   global frame, and feminist critiques of science.  Junior Theory Seminar: Black Atlantic Writers  Garcia What kind of designation is the \u201cBlack Atlantic\u201d and which writers belong within its reach? This seminar explores European, Caribbean and American texts alongside theories of the Black Atlantic and other accounts of modern racial formation. Writers include Frederick Douglass, Alain Locke, Edouard Glissant, Nella Larsen, W. E. B. Du Bois, Fernando Ortiz, C. L. R. James and Stuart Hall. Topics include modernism in African American literary culture, the reading of \u201crace\u201d in British cultural studies, and the history of Afro-Cuban modernity.  Comparative Imperialisms: Anglophone Middle Eastern Literature   Halim Although literature by Middle Easterners, particularly Arabs, in English not a new phenomenon, it has boomed in recent decades. In addressing Anglophone Middle Eastern literatures, this course covers the output of both writers resident in their country of origin and ones living in the diaspora, across a range of genres, including poetry, fiction, essay, and memoir (especially cookbook memoirs). Focusing on the increasing racialization of Arabs and Muslims in the USA after 9/11 and the War on Iraq, we will pay special attention to Anglophone literature by Arab-Americans and the riposte to stereotypes it represents. Drawing on postcolonial theory and transnational studies, the course will pose, among others, the following questions: How do we parse the legacy of Orientalism in the way religion and gender inflect the perceptions of Middle Easterners, for example in the image of the veil in relation to the trope of the harem? Are there certain genres that have been privileged over others by \u00e9migr\u00e9s from the Middle East, and if so, how would we explain this? What risks of complicity may come with identities hyphenated across warring sides? What are the uses and perils at stake in deploying \u201cexile\u201d as a metaphor? Just to what extent are the terms available to describe these \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 \u201cArab-American\u201d; \u201cIranian-American\u201d; \u201cAmerican Muslim\u201d; \u201cMiddle Easterner\u201d \u2013 adequate or incisive? In what way has the Arab Spring affected perceptions of Middle Easterners in Norh America? Readings by, among others: Diana Abu-Jaber; Carol Bardenstein; Hamid Dabashi; Suheir Hammad; Mohja Kahf; Hisham Matar; Nadine Naber; Azar Nafisi; Edward W. Said; Ahdaf Soueif.  Intro to Comp Lit: ECSTASY  Lezra Ec-stasy , to be drawn out of one\u2019s place, out of oneself; to be moved, enraptured, captivated. A religious experience, an erotic one, an aesthetic one; the fruit of alcohol or psychotropics, of reading or thinking, of a transcendent vision, of a sublime experience, of the touch of flesh on flesh. Also a hint of the dangerous: to lose oneself, or to lose the self\u2014with the threat that one will be unable to return to what one was, or that one will be destroyed. A fringe-concept and a fringe-experience. Literature\u2014itself a sort of border-concept, attached to different forms of expression: philosophy, theology, mythology, visual art, film, music\u2014has an old, peculiar relation to ecstasy. That relation is the subject of our class. This course serves as an Introduction to Comparative Literature through ecstasy. We will read, watch, view and listen to philosophical works by Plato (the \u201cSymposium\u201d and the \u201cPhaedrus\u201d), Kant ( Critique of Judgment ), Bataille, Adorno, Irigaray, Williams, Foucault, Deleuze, Berlant and others; fiction by Woolf ( To the Lighthouse ), Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, and Lispector; religious/autobiographical works by Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross; poetry by Ovid, Petrarch, Donne, Ronsard, Shakespeare, Quevedo, Shelley, Hopkins, and Moore; films by Bu\u00f1uel ( Belle de jour ), Almod\u00f3var ( Matador ), Hitchcock ( Rope ); Mozart/da Ponte\u2019s opera Don Giovanni ); selections from Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio , and albums by Patti Smith, the Velvet Underground, the Doors, and Nirvana; and sexological treatises by Sacher-Masoch. (Not all of these, but many of them.)  The Spanish Civil War: Fascism, Violence and Memory  Matos-Martin Widely acknowledged as a precursor to World War II, the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) \u201crevealed what war on European soil could mean, presaging the purificatory, genocidal, and retributive conflicts of those many other civil wars waged across the continent between 1939 and the end of the 1940s,\u201d as historian Helen Graham argues. As the earliest example of battleground against fascism, those conflict years fascinated and attracted individuals from across the world, including George Orwell and Ernest Hemingway, and have continued to be the object of numerous books and other cultural products. Not so well known and studied, however, is the long-lasted and violent fascist regime established once the democratic Spanish Republic was eventually defeated. The purpose of this course is to examine the war and the fascist dictatorship that followed and perpetuated the logic of war through its politics of death and repression, with a special focus on fictional and cultural representations. Literary texts, films, and documentaries will be analyzed in comparison with other artistic and cultural forms of expression (photography, painting), and accompanied by readings in history and theory. Topics to be discussed might include political and ideological dynamics of war and fascism (comparing the Spanish case with other fascist regimes such as the Nazis through such theoretical lenses as biopolitics, for example), representations of violence, memory and history, and justice. Writers, directors and artists whose works we might examine include: Dulce Chac\u00f3n, Alberto M\u00e9ndez, Max Aub, Guillermo del Toro, Ken Loach, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, Rafael Alberti, Pablo Neruda, Isaac Rosa, David Trueba, Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuerda, Pablo Picasso, and Isaac Rosa.  Text and Ideas: Paranoia  Sanders It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about the structure of narrative\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers,\u201d its drive for explanation of origins\u2014that is paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key autobiographical and fictional works, such as Daniel Paul Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen Eighty-Four , Bessie Head\u2019s A Question of Power , J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter, Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .  Topics in 20th Century Literature: Documents, Documentary, Fiction  Vatulescu This course will explore representative works from key moments in the evolution of documentary\u2014the beginnings of the newsreel, literatura fakta, Soviet and Nazi propaganda, American depression documentary books, the cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 movement, and the rise of autobiographical/personal documentary films. What accounts for the waxing and waning of the documentary through time, as evident in its recent popularity in American culture? What is the relationship between documentary modes and particular media and technologies\u2014print, photography, cinema, video, and digital? Other topics include the role of the artist, indexicality and representation, literature as historical document, \u201cfiction in the archives,\u201d false documents and forgery, collage, illustration, and other uses of the document in twentieth century art. This semester\u2019s special topics are 1) the archive, 2)word/image relations, and 3) fiction vs. document. Theoretical forays around and into the archive will be complemented by hands-on research in an archive of your choice.
