The first concerns the way in which the perceived lack of  fit between stereotypes of women and perceptions of the requirements for jobs  considered to be male in gender type leads to negative performance  expectations, and resulting gender bias in judgments. \u00a0 We have shown, for example, that women, as  compared to men, are less likely to be selected for male gender-typed  positions, are more likely to have their performance in such positions  devalued, and are given fewer opportunities for career advancement. \u00a0 More recently, we have focused on the  tenacity of stereotype-based expectations and their resistance to  disconfirming information. \u00a0 For  example, we have demonstrated a process we call \u201c attributional   rationalization\u201d, in which a woman member of a successful team is unlikely to  get as much credit for a team\u2019s success as her male counterpart, and she is  seen as having been less influential in bringing about the successful outcome. \u00a0 We are currently investigating other ways  in which positive performance information about women is distorted so as to  maintain gender stereotypes, and are examining the ways in which perceptions  of femininity, such as being a mother or being attractive, can exacerbate  stereotyped-based bias. \u00a0      The second research interest concerns the unintended  negative effects of preferential selection on those who have been targeted to  benefit from it. \u00a0 On the one hand we  are interested in the reactions of others to those who are believed to have  been preferentially selected through diversity or affirmative action programs. \u00a0 On the other hand, we are interested in how  those people who believe they have been preferentially selected for important  positions feel about themselves and their work, and how they perform on the  job as a consequence. \u00a0\u00a0 To date, we  have demonstrated that a stigma of incompetence is attached to those  perceived to have obtained their positions through a preferential selection  procedure. \u00a0 We also have demonstrated  that preferential selection as compared to merit-based selection can result  in a more negative view of self and performance, a greater desire to  relinquish a leadership role, a greater incidence of mistreatment of similar  others, and an increased choice of undemanding and routine tasks. \u00a0 Current work focuses on the cues people use  to infer that preferential selection has in fact occurred.      The third research interest involves gender stereotypic  norms, which dictate the ways in which women should behave, and the  disapproval and approbation women experience for violating these \u201c shoulds \u201d. \u00a0 We have looked  at reactions to actual violations of prescribed behaviors, demonstrating that  women who choose not to help others are reacted to far more negatively than  males who behave similarly, and are given less credit when they do help. \u00a0 Moreover, we have looked at inferred  violations of gender norms, and shown that women are penalized for being  successful in domains that are considered to be male, and are disliked and  interpersonally derogated as a consequence. \u00a0  We have further probed the dynamics underlying this process, and have  considered why women join men in penalizing women for their success, whether  men also are subjected to penalties when they are successful in gender  inconsistent domains, and the ways in which a woman\u2019s perceived femininity  can intensify or ameliorate these effects. \u00a0  \u00a0 In addition, we currently are  addressing the question of whether women\u2019s anticipation of being penalized  for gender norm violation leads to self-censorship of self advocating  behaviors in an effort to stave off negative reactions.   back to the top        Biography   Education:   Ph.D. 1972 (social psychology), Columbia ;   B.S. 1967 (child development and family relations), Cornell.

The first concerns the way in which the perceived lack of  fit between stereotypes of women and perceptions of the requirements for jobs  considered to be male in gender type leads to negative performance  expectations, and resulting gender bias in judgments. \u00a0 We have shown, for example, that women, as  compared to men, are less likely to be selected for male gender-typed  positions, are more likely to have their performance in such positions  devalued, and are given fewer opportunities for career advancement. \u00a0 More recently, we have focused on the  tenacity of stereotype-based expectations and their resistance to  disconfirming information. \u00a0 For  example, we have demonstrated a process we call \u201c attributional   rationalization\u201d, in which a woman member of a successful team is unlikely to  get as much credit for a team\u2019s success as her male counterpart, and she is  seen as having been less influential in bringing about the successful outcome. \u00a0 We are currently investigating other ways  in which positive performance information about women is distorted so as to  maintain gender stereotypes, and are examining the ways in which perceptions  of femininity, such as being a mother or being attractive, can exacerbate  stereotyped-based bias. \u00a0      The second research interest concerns the unintended  negative effects of preferential selection on those who have been targeted to  benefit from it. \u00a0 On the one hand we  are interested in the reactions of others to those who are believed to have  been preferentially selected through diversity or affirmative action programs. \u00a0 On the other hand, we are interested in how  those people who believe they have been preferentially selected for important  positions feel about themselves and their work, and how they perform on the  job as a consequence. \u00a0\u00a0 To date, we  have demonstrated that a stigma of incompetence is attached to those  perceived to have obtained their positions through a preferential selection  procedure. \u00a0 We also have demonstrated  that preferential selection as compared to merit-based selection can result  in a more negative view of self and performance, a greater desire to  relinquish a leadership role, a greater incidence of mistreatment of similar  others, and an increased choice of undemanding and routine tasks. \u00a0 Current work focuses on the cues people use  to infer that preferential selection has in fact occurred.      The third research interest involves gender stereotypic  norms, which dictate the ways in which women should behave, and the  disapproval and approbation women experience for violating these \u201c shoulds \u201d. \u00a0 We have looked  at reactions to actual violations of prescribed behaviors, demonstrating that  women who choose not to help others are reacted to far more negatively than  males who behave similarly, and are given less credit when they do help. \u00a0 Moreover, we have looked at inferred  violations of gender norms, and shown that women are penalized for being  successful in domains that are considered to be male, and are disliked and  interpersonally derogated as a consequence. \u00a0  We have further probed the dynamics underlying this process, and have  considered why women join men in penalizing women for their success, whether  men also are subjected to penalties when they are successful in gender  inconsistent domains, and the ways in which a woman\u2019s perceived femininity  can intensify or ameliorate these effects. \u00a0  \u00a0 In addition, we currently are  addressing the question of whether women\u2019s anticipation of being penalized  for gender norm violation leads to self-censorship of self advocating  behaviors in an effort to stave off negative reactions.   back to the top        Biography   Education:   Ph.D. 1972 (social psychology), Columbia ;   B.S. 1967 (child development and family relations), Cornell.
