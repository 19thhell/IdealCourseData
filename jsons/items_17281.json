Specifically, the NYU Langone team, led by senior study investigator and cell biologist, Ruth Lehmann, PhD , found that blocking the action of the mitochondrial ATP synthase enzyme stalled egg cell development from stem cells in experiments in fruit flies, one of the main organisms used to study cell biology.\u00a0The results were published in the journal Nature Cell Biology .

And can undergraduates pursue research? NYU's College of Arts and Science has long been at the forefront of promoting undergraduate research, which can take many shapes. Students at NYU spend time working with teams of scientists in laboratories; they spend time picking through boxes in archival libraries; they interview eyewitnesses to cultural and historical events in foreign countries. Curiosity drives academic inquiry: as long as you have a question that needs answering, you can undertake research.      All of our majors offer Honors tracks, to which original inquiry is central, and many of our students go on to write the Senior Honors thesis, which is a capstone project requiring research within their major. But the opportunity to perform various kinds of research is open to all students. The Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund, created through the generosity of alumni, parents, and friends, provides students in the College with the material support necessary to carry out their inquiries. In addition, departmental funding is also available, particularly in the sciences, through individual faculty members' grants. Our annual Undergraduate Research Conference, which was established over thirty years ago and encompasses the sciences, humanities, and social science, is a celebration of the variety of research our students undertake.      This website provides you with faculty research opportunities, internships, and possible funding sources.

The quality of the research enterprise is what truly distinguishes a great university, permitting it to draw in the most talented scholars and the top students. NYU\u2019s faculty are at the forefront of their scholarly disciplines, and their research helps shape the understanding of an enormous range of academic fields: from the mathematical sciences to economics, from philosophy to neural science, from art history to sociology. In recognition of the quality of this research, NYU received approximately $200 million in government funds in 2008.     NYU\u2019s also makes it own major commitments to the research enterprise. Through the Partners Initiative, first announced in 2004, the University is increasing tenured and tenure-track positions in the arts and sciences by 20% -- 125 additional faculty positions. And this growth has been accompanied significant investment in new facilities to support faculty scholarship in genomics research and in soft condensed matter physics, as well as through major renovations of laboratories in the Silver Center, to cite just a few examples. In addition, the Provost\u2019s Office oversees research grants program to allow faculty to compete for additional funding to pursue research.            The Role of Libraries at a  Research University   A world-class research institution needs a world-class library with deep and ever expanding resources in all formats. NYU Libraries supports research with a broad range of instructional services and collections that include, for example, more than 5.9 million volumes, 163,000 sound and video recordings, and more than a million e-books and databases. The NYU community conducted more than 4.7 million BobCat catalog searches last year and visited library.nyu.edu more than 2.5 million times.   NYU Libraries\u2019 flagship facility is the striking, 12-story Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square. Designed by Philip Johnson and Richard Foster, it serves as a center for scholarship and a hub of the University community's intellectual life.
