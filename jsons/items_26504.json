When you complete the dual degree program, you will be eligible for New York State certification as a teacher of mathematics for grades 7-12.       Overview    Eligibility and Requirements    Junior/Senior Year Courses    MA Courses    Advising       Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.    Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.       Eligibility and Requirements for the BA Mathematics/MA Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12 Program    CAS students majoring in mathematics are eligible for this dual degree program. Students complete 13 credits of the 43 credits for the MA while they are still undergraduates. These 13 credits are specified below.    Students must earn a B or better in all Steinhardt courses in order for these to be applied to the MA dual degree. Students must complete all requirements of their major as well as college-wide requirements prior to matriculating at Steinhardt.    Learn more about why pursuing this dual degree program and becoming a teacher are both good ideas.       Steinhardt Graduate Courses to be Completed During Junior or Senior Year    During their junior or senior year, CAS math majors complete 12 credits in Teaching Math in place of other electives. These 12 credits count as electives toward the BA degree in math from CAS.
