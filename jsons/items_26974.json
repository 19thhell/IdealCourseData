These courses comprise creative work including choreography and performance. Choreography is approached through exploration of resources, including improvisation, use of ideas, knowledge of forms, development of craft. First-year students receive weekly assignments directed toward specific problems and dance elements. Second-year work develops with an emphasis on the relationship between manipulation of musical phrases and choreography as well as the completion of dances. Work begun in all composition classes may be performed in studio theatre concerts. Other performance opportunities derive from repertory classes, performance workshops, and major dance works choreographed by faculty and guest choreographers that are assigned and also from student and faculty choreography pursued independently outside of course work.

Supervised by our experienced faculty, these showings are comprised entirely of student choreographers and serve as a means through which students experiment with different aesthetics, styles, and concepts of dance. Additionally, Showing IV offers choreographers and dancers the opportunity to explore the use of digital and new media as a part of the choreographic process. Lasting around an hour and a half, the Showings are performed with full lights, costumes, are a wonderful display of the individuality, ingenuity, and intelligence of the dancers and choreographers at Tisch.
