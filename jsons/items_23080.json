The major goals of this specialization are to enable students to:   Evaluate and use knowledge and understanding of values and institutional contexts for environmental and infrastructure planning.   Explore theories and historical trends to evaluate relationships between environmental condition, public service capacity, and development options, and their consequences of human actions on the environment.   Understand choices about and ways of balancing the use and protection of environmental resources in urban and natural environmental contexts and in the context of other social needs.   Engage public interests in the process of environmental, infrastructure and transportation planning.
