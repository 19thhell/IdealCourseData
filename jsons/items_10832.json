Bio:   Research and Publication      My first book, The Wine Song in Classical Arabic Poetry: Abu Nuwas and the literary tradition (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997) traces the development of the genre of wine poetry from pre-Islamic Arabia to its heyday in early 9th century Abbasid Iraq. Abu Nuwas is one of the five greatest poets of the Arabic tradition, and his wine poetry is far from obscure; it is a staple of any university course on pre-modern Arabic literature. It is indeed startling that a culture in which wine was religiously proscribed should have spawned the most developed \"Bacchic\" verse in world literature. To read and understand the wine poems is essential for a proper understanding of the cultural pluralism of early Islamic civilization. It also exposes the complexity of the poetic tradition, since the wine theme developed in tandem with the whole poetic corpus and there is a complex intertextuality subtending it, relating it in a varied dynamic with ascetic/pious poetry, erotic poetry, invective poetry and the more formal panegyric poetry of the court. And there is of course a more universal humanistic aspect to this poetry which renders it fascinating to any student of literature. The Wine Song attempts to uncover and explore the complexity of some of Abu Nuwas greatest poems.     I am currently completing a book-length manuscript, entitled Islamic Recognitions: Anagnorisis in Arabic Narrative Literatur . This is a typological study of narrative epistemology concentrating on the medieval period, and focusing on the important way that anagnorisis/recognition provides narratives with both structure and theme; emerging as the latter (theme) recognition furnishes an important semiotic and hermeneutic tool for interpreting narratives across distinct genres. After a theoretical Introduction this study contains seven chapters: 1) Anagnorisis in the Qur'an and the Life of Muhammad ; 2) Joseph as Figure of Disclosure and Avatar of Romance ; 3) Synecdoche and Metonymy in early Isma`ili Memoirs ; 4) The Arabian Nights -- Part 1: the Fall of the Barmakids and the Cycle of the Two Viziers (recognition and the disclosure of truth in historiography and fiction); 5) The Arabian Nights -- Part 2: Recognition and the Reader ; 6) Unmasking Deceit: the picaresque Maqama ; 7) \"L'Image Juste: Juste un Image\": on modern Arabic drama and the novel .     Anagnorisis has been an essential figure in Western poetics. Arabic literature itself does not have an indigenous narrative poetics, therefore the perspective of this study provides a novel point of comparison between Arabic and Western literature. The study is driven by a theoretical paradigm, but provides close in depth readings of a variety of texts, including the modern Arabic novel. The book will be published by Routledge/Curzon Press in the series Studies in Arabic and Middle Eastern Literatures .

                            The Library of Arabic Literature (LAL) project responds to a marked absence in the Anglophone world by producing a library of the classic works of Arabic Islamic literature and culture in parallel-text editions -- Arabic and English running texts on facing pages. The translations, which will be produced in a clear, modern idiom, will be accessible by general readers and academics alike. LAL will be a standing project with the long-term goal of translating a substantial library in the coming years. The project includes an international editorial board of leading Arabic scholars from around the world, each of whom will discuss their work at public workshops and lectures at NYU Abu Dhabi and other Abu Dhabi schools.

Like many pre-modern Arabic anthologies it aims at being both entertaining and informative. It ranges from the early Bedouin poems with their evocation of desert life to refined urban lyrical verse, from tender love poetry to sonorous eulogy or vicious lampoons, and from the heights of mystical rapture to the frivolity of comic verse. The prose contains anecdotes, entertaining or edifying tales and parables, a fairy-tale, a bawdy story, samples of literary criticism, and much more.     With this anthology, distinguished Arabist Geert Jan van Gelder brings together well-known texts as well as less familiar pieces that will be new even to scholars in the field. Many recent studies and anthologies of Middle Eastern literatures are primarily interested in Islam and religious matters\u2014an emphasis that leads to the common misconception that almost everything in the region was and is dominated by religion. Classical Arabic Literature instead brings to life the rich variety of pre-modern Arabic social and cultural life, where secular texts happily coexisted with religious ones. This masterful anthology, in English only, will introduce this vibrant literary heritage to a wide spectrum of new readers.     _______   Geert Jan van Gelder was Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford from 1998 to 2012. He is the author of several books on classical Arabic literature, including Beyond the Line: Classical Arabic Literary Critics on the Coherence and Unity of the Poem and Of Dishes and Discourse: Classical Arabic Literary Representations of Food .                                 The Epistle on Legal Theory            Al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b   Edited and translated by Joseph E. Lowry     The Epistle on Legal Theory is the oldest surviving Arabic work on Islamic legal theory and the foundational document of Islamic jurisprudence. Its author, Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b (d.204H / 820AD), was the eponymous founder of the Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b legal school, one of the four rites in Sunni Islam. This fascinating work offers the first systematic treatment in Arabic of key issues in Islamic legal thought. These include a survey of the importance of Arabic as the language of revelation, principles of textual interpretation to be applied to the Qur\u2019an and prophetic Traditions, techniques for harmonizing apparently contradictory precedents, legal epistemology, rules of inference, and situations in which legal interpretation is required. The author illustrates his theoretical claims with numerous examples drawn from nearly all areas of Islamic law, including ritual, commercial law, tort law, and criminal law.     The text thus provides an important window into both Islamic law and legal thought generally and early Islamic intellectual history in particular. The Arabic text has been established on the basis of the two most important critical editions and includes variants in the notes, while the English text is a new translation by a leading scholar of Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b and his thought. The Epistle on Legal Theory represents one of the earliest complete works on Islamic law, one that is centrally important for the formation of Islamic legal thought and the Islamic legal tradition.     ________   Joseph E. Lowry is Associate Professor of Arabic and Islamic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. His books include Early Islamic Legal Theory: The Ris\u0101la of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn Idr\u012bs al-Sh\u0101fi\u02bf\u012b . His research and publications focus on the Qur\u2019an, Islamic law, and Arabic literature. Before becoming an academic he was an attorney in private practice in Washington, D.C.                                   A Treasury of Virtues: Sayings, Sermons and Teachings of \u02bfAl\u012b with the One Hundred Proverbs, attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93            Al-Q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b al-Qu\u1e0d\u0101\u02bf\u012b     Edited and translated by Tahe ra Qutbuddin     A Treasury of Virtues is a collection of sayings, sermons, and teachings attributed to \u02bfAl\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib (d. 40H/661AD), cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and fourth caliph. \u02bfAl\u012b was an acknowledged master of Arabic eloquence and a renowned sage of Islamic wisdom. Through proverbs and aphorisms, sermons and speeches, prayers and supplications, epistles and contracts, testimonials and homilies, verse and dialogues, it provides instruction on how to be a decent human being. And it combines these ethical teachings with religious exhortations and preparation for eternal life in the hereafter. Moreover, the lessons of the text are clothed in the cadenced parallelisms of a consummate oral culture, and the vivid metaphors of the Arabian desert. Appealing to the addressee\u2019s  higher nature, they also beguile his aesthetic sensibilities, integrating art and edification in an exquisite package of verbal ingenuity.     Of the many compilations of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words, A Treasury of Virtues arguably possesses the broadest compass of genres, and the largest variety of themes. The shorter One Hundred Proverbs is also a compilation of \u02bfAl\u012b\u2019s words. Attributed to al-J\u0101\u1e25i\u1e93 (\u201cthe father of Arabic prose\u201d), it has a celebrity status in its own category and its pithy one-liners are quotable quotes of the finest order. This volume presents the first English translation of both these important texts, with a new critical edition based on several original manuscripts.
