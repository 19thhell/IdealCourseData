This is by no means a comprehensive   list of programs; nor is it an endorsement of any particular program.   Please contact the program for further information concerning course   offerings and application procedures. Many of these programs sponsor   students with various types of financial aid.     FLAS Fellowships may only be used at institutions whose   programs meet the standards of the US Department of Education (USDE)   for intensive training (one year equivalency), course length (6 weeks   minimum) and classroom hours (140 minimum).If you are awarded a summer FLAS award, please contact the program coordinator to verify that your program is eligible for FLAS, as they are subject to approval by the DOE. In awarding FLAS for summer study, NYU   gives priority to those applicants who have applied for financial aid   from the programs they plan to attend. Attendance at any particular   program with a FLAS fellowship will be contingent upon the   availability of matching funds beyond the $4,000 Department of   Education tuition cap.     The Department of Education will follow State Department travel   advisories when approving FLAS travel to summer programs in the   Middle East. The State Department posts travel information at http://www.state.gov/countries/ .
