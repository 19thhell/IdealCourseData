Experimental approaches in neural science  vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and  groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole  organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational  modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.  Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and  neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural  circuits consisting of small numbers  of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the  relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the  behavior of organisms.          The undergraduate Neural Science curriculum blends courses from many of the  basic sciences as a foundation for higher level work in Neural Science.            Minimum requirements for graduation include:         6 courses in Neural Science (24 pts)   3 courses in Biology (12 pts)    2 courses in Chemistry (10 pts)    1 course in Physics (5 pts)    1 course in Psychology (Statistics) (4 pts)      1 course at the Calculus level in mathematics (4 pts)    1 upper level elective course in either Biology or Experimental  Psychology.

Advisors at the College Advising office,  and DUSs in other departments, cannot declare a student a Neural  Science major. In order to be eligible to declare a Neural Science major, a  student must have grades of C or better in all courses required for the  major that have been completed   at the time of declaration. Students cannot officially declare the Neural  Science Major until they have received a grade of B- or better in   Introduction to Neural Science (INTRONS) .       Students who have completed INTRONS may submit their request to declare  their major electronically here:           Declaration of Neural Science Major             Students who are not eligible to declare the major may request to receive  announcements of interest to intended majors here:           Neural Science Interest Form           Specific Course Requirements for the Major      Neural Science Courses:   The first course students take in Neural Science is Introduction to  Neural Science (INTRONS) , taught annually in the Fall; ideally this  course should be taken in the sophomore year after a student has completed  the first 2 courses of the Biology Core sequence (Bio I, Bio II). Following  Introduction to Neural Science, students take each of two higher level  Neural Science courses: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMNB) ,  taught annually in the Fall, and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience  (BINS) , taught annually in the Spring; these courses should ideally be  taken in the Sophomore or Junior year.     Students then take three of the Neural Science elective courses:  e.g., Development and Dysfunction of the NS , Computational  Neuroscience , or Special Topics in Neural Science .         Biology Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take the first 3 courses of  the Biology core curriculum: Principles of Biology I, II , and   Molecular and Cell Biology I . The first two of these courses are  preparation for Introduction to Neural Science. The third, MCBio 1, is the  prerequisite to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology , and is typically  taken in the same semester as INTRONS. MCBio 1 is only offered in the Fall  semester.   In addition, majors can then choose to  take one or more courses from a selection of upper level offerings in the  Biology curriculum (see list below).        Psychology Courses:      Neural science majors are required to take a statistics course:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences PSYCH-UA 10. Students  may request the substitution of other courses from minors or other majors  for this requirement as well, but Quantitative Reasoning in the College Core Curriculum is not an  acceptable substitution.  Majors can then choose to take one or more courses from a selection of   upper-level  offerings in the Experimental Psychology curriculum (see list below).        Chemistry Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take 2 chemistry courses with the  associated labs: General Chemistry I & II . As these classes are a  prerequisite to MCBio 1, most majors will take these courses in conjunction  with Bio I & II in their freshmen year. PreHealth note: Pre-health  students must also take Organic Chemistry I & II .        Physics Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take one course in Physics:   General Physics II . Pre-health students must also take General  Physics I .      Physics II is offered annually in the  Spring and is required prior to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology .   Neural Science majors who are not completing the Pre-Health track   may request an  exemption from the Physics I prerequisite to Physics II from the Physics  department when registering in the Spring semester.        Mathematics Courses:      All Neural Science majors must take Calculus I . There is room in  the curriculum in the event that students require precalculus-level  mathematics. Students interested in Computational Neuroscience research are encouraged  to pursue Caluclus II or above.       Computer Science Courses:    Introduction to Computer Science is recommended for all students,  but not required.     Grading and Academic Performance Requirements   The minimum acceptable grade in courses required for the major is C.  These academic standards must be maintained in order for major standing to  continue.       Honors  Students must apply to the DUS for admission to the Honors Track.   Students requesting Honors status must receive a B or better in  Introduction to Neural Science, achieve a grade point average of 3.65 or  better in all courses required for the major and 3.65 over all courses  taken for credit. Students should also demonstrate a genuine interest in  research. Students must conduct at least one semester of research with a  faculty member affiliated with the Center for Neural Science (or an  otherwise approved faculty member). The student must submit an honors  thesis that must be accepted for Honors   standing by the faculty sponsor and the DUS. Presentation of the  thesis work at NYU's annual Undergraduate Research Conference is required.  Students must also complete 8 additional credits of coursework by taking two laboratory classes and an  Honors seminar.

For formatting guidelines for the Honors thesis, please see here .                     Minors   There is no Minor concentration in Neural Science. Neural Science  courses can be taken as electives through the Biology or Psychology  Departments for interested students. Students wishing to major in Neural  Science and declare a Minor in another science department must take 1-2  additional courses in that department, beyond those required for the major  (one for Chemistry, two for Psychology). Students may not minor in Biology.             Double Majors   Students wishing to major in Neural Science and declare a second major in  another science department may be required to take 1-2 additional courses  beyond those required for the major in that department as approved by the  DUSs.           For students wishing to double major in Psychology and Neural  Science:   PSYCH 10 ( Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences ) and NEURL-UA 220  ( Behavioral & Integrative NS ) can be used toward the degree in both  majors. If the student chooses to fulfill the 'Biology/Psychology' elective  requirement with a Psychology course, this course can not be one used  toward the Psychology degree.             There is no allowed double-major for Neural Science and Biology.              Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science   All students must meet the additional requirements of the College Core Corriculum in order to have a broad,  well-rounded liberal arts education. Neural Science students need to  satisfy the Expository Writing, Foreign Language, and Foundations of  Contemporary Culture components of the Core Curriculum. In addition, students may need  to pass the English Writing Proficiency exam administered by the Expository  Writing program. The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) requirement is satisfied through the Neural Science major course requirements.          Study Abroad   Neural Science now has study away courses that can be taken at NYU Shanghai.  They are Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology and three Neural Science  electives: Neural Bases of Speech and Language; Networks and Dynamics;  and Free Will and the Brain. In addition, the major requires many  science classes outside of the department, which can be taken abroad.  Students studying in London or Sydney typically take  Physics II (PHYS-UA 9012) and Cognition (PSYCH-UA 9029) to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology Elective requirement of the major.  Molecular and Cellular Biology II and Biochemistry I can also be taken  at NYU Tel Aviv, while Perception can be taken at NYU Berlin to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology elective requirement. Due to the  sequential nature of Neural Science courses, Neural Science majors  should plan to study away in the Spring of their Sophomore or Junior  year, or possibly in the Fall of their Senior year. Physics II must  be completed prior to taking Cellular Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210),  which is only offered in Spring semesters. This is the primary  sequential constraint on the Spring semester for majors. Majors  intending to do Honors are encouraged to study away during the  Sophomore year. Non-honors majors are better served studying away in  the Junior year, unless they began the major \"late\" - e.g. taking  Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) in their Junior instead  of Sophomore year. Students who wish to study in a non-London or  Sydney location can typically do so if they are not Pre-Health.

Office Address:      New York University    Department of Biology    1009 Silver Center    100 Washington Square East    New York, NY 10003-6688      Email:        Phone:   (212) 998-3109   Fax:   (212) 995-4015       Areas of Research/Interest:   Computational Neuroscience, Phototransduction, Stochastic Problems in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Genome-Scale Data     List of Publications from Pubmed       List of citations from Google Scholar         Research:    My research in computational biology and neuroscience integrates data from experimental studies, theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling, and computer simulation.    One of my ongoing projects, in vertebrate phototransduction, focuses on light adaptation in rods and cones, and on the reproducibility of rod responses to single photons. Electrophysiological and biochemical data provide a basis for developing mathematical models that account for light adaptation and statistical properties of the singe-photon response in terms of the molecular mechanisms underlying phototransduction.    Another ongoing project involves the development of \"statistical mechanical\" methods for modeling large neural networks. These methods employ the theory of the probability (population) density function. Factors that make conventional methods unwieldy or intractable - thousands of neurons and millions of synapses \u00acare used to great advantage in these methods. Similar neurons are lumped together into populations, and one tracks the distribution of neurons over state space in each population. The state of a neuron is determined by the dynamic variables in the underlying single-neuron model. The population-firing rate is given by the flux of probability across a particular surface in state space. Neurons are coupled via stochastic synapses; the rate of excitatory/inhibitory input events for a target neuron is determined by the rate of action potentials in each of the presynaptic populations and by the average number of synapses the postsynaptic neuron receives from each of these populations.    In an ongoing collaboration with Arjun Raj at the University of Pennsylvania, I am analyzing and modeling stochastic gene expression. The models include gene switching, synthesis and degradation of mRNA and proteins, and cell divisions. A goal is to understand sources of large fluctuations in the number of transcripts from genes that are expressed at low levels, the consequences for protein levels, and the implications for cell fate and cell physiology in general. Future modeling will focus on gene networks.    Finally, I am collaborating with Professor Gloria Coruzzi and her lab on projects involving the identification and modeling of gene regulatory networks underlying nitrogen assimilation and metabolism in Arabidopsis . Statistical analysis of microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data plays a central role in these projects.    Teaching:    I teach both in the Department of Biology and the Department of Mathematics.    Graduate Biology courses include: Statistics in Biology Mathematics in Medicine and Biology Computers in Medicine and Biology    Graduate Mathematics courses include: Mathematical Aspects of Neurophysiology Stochastic Problems in Cellular, Molecular and Neural Science    Biosketch:    I received my Ph.D. in 1981 from the Rockefeller University, where I studied physical chemistry, membrane biophysics, neurophysiology, and mathematics. My dissertation was an analysis of information processing in the outer retina of the turtle. My postdoctoral research was a combined experimental and theoretical study of light adaptation -- a process by which the retina adjusts its sensitivity according to lighting conditions. In 1984, I joined the faculty of New York University with a joint appointment in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Biology.

Experimental approaches in neural science  vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and  groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole  organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational  modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science.  Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and  neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural  circuits consisting of small numbers  of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the  relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the  behavior of organisms.          The undergraduate Neural Science curriculum blends courses from many of the  basic sciences as a foundation for higher level work in Neural Science.            Minimum requirements for graduation include:         6 courses in Neural Science (24 pts)   3 courses in Biology (12 pts)    2 courses in Chemistry (10 pts)    1 course in Physics (5 pts)    1 course in Psychology (Statistics) (4 pts)      1 course at the Calculus level in mathematics (4 pts)    1 upper level elective course in either Biology or Experimental  Psychology.

Advisors at the College Advising office,  and DUSs in other departments, cannot declare a student a Neural  Science major. In order to be eligible to declare a Neural Science major, a  student must have grades of C or better in all courses required for the  major that have been completed   at the time of declaration. Students cannot officially declare the Neural  Science Major until they have received a grade of B- or better in   Introduction to Neural Science (INTRONS) .       Students who have completed INTRONS may submit their request to declare  their major electronically here:           Declaration of Neural Science Major             Students who are not eligible to declare the major may request to receive  announcements of interest to intended majors here:           Neural Science Interest Form           Specific Course Requirements for the Major      Neural Science Courses:   The first course students take in Neural Science is Introduction to  Neural Science (INTRONS) , taught annually in the Fall; ideally this  course should be taken in the sophomore year after a student has completed  the first 2 courses of the Biology Core sequence (Bio I, Bio II). Following  Introduction to Neural Science, students take each of two higher level  Neural Science courses: Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (CMNB) ,  taught annually in the Fall, and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience  (BINS) , taught annually in the Spring; these courses should ideally be  taken in the Sophomore or Junior year.     Students then take three of the Neural Science elective courses:  e.g., Development and Dysfunction of the NS , Computational  Neuroscience , or Special Topics in Neural Science .         Biology Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take the first 3 courses of  the Biology core curriculum: Principles of Biology I, II , and   Molecular and Cell Biology I . The first two of these courses are  preparation for Introduction to Neural Science. The third, MCBio 1, is the  prerequisite to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology , and is typically  taken in the same semester as INTRONS. MCBio 1 is only offered in the Fall  semester.   In addition, majors can then choose to  take one or more courses from a selection of upper level offerings in the  Biology curriculum (see list below).        Psychology Courses:      Neural science majors are required to take a statistics course:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences PSYCH-UA 10. Students  may request the substitution of other courses from minors or other majors  for this requirement as well, but Quantitative Reasoning in the College Core Curriculum is not an  acceptable substitution.  Majors can then choose to take one or more courses from a selection of   upper-level  offerings in the Experimental Psychology curriculum (see list below).        Chemistry Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take 2 chemistry courses with the  associated labs: General Chemistry I & II . As these classes are a  prerequisite to MCBio 1, most majors will take these courses in conjunction  with Bio I & II in their freshmen year. PreHealth note: Pre-health  students must also take Organic Chemistry I & II .        Physics Courses:      Neural Science majors are required to take one course in Physics:   General Physics II . Pre-health students must also take General  Physics I .      Physics II is offered annually in the  Spring and is required prior to Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology .   Neural Science majors who are not completing the Pre-Health track   may request an  exemption from the Physics I prerequisite to Physics II from the Physics  department when registering in the Spring semester.        Mathematics Courses:      All Neural Science majors must take Calculus I . There is room in  the curriculum in the event that students require precalculus-level  mathematics. Students interested in Computational Neuroscience research are encouraged  to pursue Caluclus II or above.       Computer Science Courses:    Introduction to Computer Science is recommended for all students,  but not required.     Grading and Academic Performance Requirements   The minimum acceptable grade in courses required for the major is C.  These academic standards must be maintained in order for major standing to  continue.       Honors  Students must apply to the DUS for admission to the Honors Track.   Students requesting Honors status must receive a B or better in  Introduction to Neural Science, achieve a grade point average of 3.65 or  better in all courses required for the major and 3.65 over all courses  taken for credit. Students should also demonstrate a genuine interest in  research. Students must conduct at least one semester of research with a  faculty member affiliated with the Center for Neural Science (or an  otherwise approved faculty member). The student must submit an honors  thesis that must be accepted for Honors   standing by the faculty sponsor and the DUS. Presentation of the  thesis work at NYU's annual Undergraduate Research Conference is required.  Students must also complete 8 additional credits of coursework by taking two laboratory classes and an  Honors seminar.    To apply for admission to the Honors Track, please   submit the application here .       For key dates pertaining to the Honors and Research Track, please see here .      For formatting guidelines for the Honors thesis, please see here .                     Minors   There is no Minor concentration in Neural Science. Neural Science  courses can be taken as electives through the Biology or Psychology  Departments for interested students. Students wishing to major in Neural  Science and declare a Minor in another science department must take 1-2  additional courses in that department, beyond those required for the major  (one for Chemistry, two for Psychology). Students may not minor in Biology.             Double Majors   Students wishing to major in Neural Science and declare a second major in  another science department may be required to take 1-2 additional courses  beyond those required for the major in that department as approved by the  DUSs.           For students wishing to double major in Psychology and Neural  Science:   PSYCH 10 ( Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences ) and NEURL-UA 220  ( Behavioral & Integrative NS ) can be used toward the degree in both  majors. If the student chooses to fulfill the 'Biology/Psychology' elective  requirement with a Psychology course, this course can not be one used  toward the Psychology degree.             There is no allowed double-major for Neural Science and Biology.              Core Curriculum of the College of Arts and Science   All students must meet the additional requirements of the College Core Corriculum in order to have a broad,  well-rounded liberal arts education. Neural Science students need to  satisfy the Expository Writing, Foreign Language, and Foundations of  Contemporary Culture components of the Core Curriculum. In addition, students may need  to pass the English Writing Proficiency exam administered by the Expository  Writing program. The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) requirement is satisfied through the Neural Science major course requirements.          Study Abroad   Neural Science now has study away courses that can be taken at NYU Shanghai.  They are Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology and three Neural Science  electives: Neural Bases of Speech and Language; Networks and Dynamics;  and Free Will and the Brain. In addition, the major requires many  science classes outside of the department, which can be taken abroad.  Students studying in London or Sydney typically take  Physics II (PHYS-UA 9012) and Cognition (PSYCH-UA 9029) to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology Elective requirement of the major.  Molecular and Cellular Biology II and Biochemistry I can also be taken  at NYU Tel Aviv, while Perception can be taken at NYU Berlin to fulfill  the upper-level Biology/Psychology elective requirement. Due to the  sequential nature of Neural Science courses, Neural Science majors  should plan to study away in the Spring of their Sophomore or Junior  year, or possibly in the Fall of their Senior year. Physics II must  be completed prior to taking Cellular Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210),  which is only offered in Spring semesters. This is the primary  sequential constraint on the Spring semester for majors. Majors  intending to do Honors are encouraged to study away during the  Sophomore year. Non-honors majors are better served studying away in  the Junior year, unless they began the major \"late\" - e.g. taking  Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) in their Junior instead  of Sophomore year. Students who wish to study in a non-London or  Sydney location can typically do so if they are not Pre-Health.  We also strongly encourage students to consider Summer and Winter  Study Abroad at other locations when possible. Students should consult  with their Neural Science Advisor for individualized course planning.      For more information, click here for a PDF.

Office Address:      New York University    Department of Biology    1009 Silver Center    100 Washington Square East    New York, NY 10003-6688      Email:        Phone:   (212) 998-3109   Fax:   (212) 995-4015       Areas of Research/Interest:   Computational Neuroscience, Phototransduction, Stochastic Problems in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Genome-Scale Data     List of Publications from Pubmed       List of citations from Google Scholar         Research:    My research in computational biology and neuroscience integrates data from experimental studies, theoretical analysis, mathematical modeling, and computer simulation.    One of my ongoing projects, in vertebrate phototransduction, focuses on light adaptation in rods and cones, and on the reproducibility of rod responses to single photons. Electrophysiological and biochemical data provide a basis for developing mathematical models that account for light adaptation and statistical properties of the singe-photon response in terms of the molecular mechanisms underlying phototransduction.    Another ongoing project involves the development of \"statistical mechanical\" methods for modeling large neural networks. These methods employ the theory of the probability (population) density function. Factors that make conventional methods unwieldy or intractable - thousands of neurons and millions of synapses \u00acare used to great advantage in these methods. Similar neurons are lumped together into populations, and one tracks the distribution of neurons over state space in each population. The state of a neuron is determined by the dynamic variables in the underlying single-neuron model. The population-firing rate is given by the flux of probability across a particular surface in state space. Neurons are coupled via stochastic synapses; the rate of excitatory/inhibitory input events for a target neuron is determined by the rate of action potentials in each of the presynaptic populations and by the average number of synapses the postsynaptic neuron receives from each of these populations.    In an ongoing collaboration with Arjun Raj at the University of Pennsylvania, I am analyzing and modeling stochastic gene expression. The models include gene switching, synthesis and degradation of mRNA and proteins, and cell divisions. A goal is to understand sources of large fluctuations in the number of transcripts from genes that are expressed at low levels, the consequences for protein levels, and the implications for cell fate and cell physiology in general. Future modeling will focus on gene networks.    Finally, I am collaborating with Professor Gloria Coruzzi and her lab on projects involving the identification and modeling of gene regulatory networks underlying nitrogen assimilation and metabolism in Arabidopsis . Statistical analysis of microarray, RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq data plays a central role in these projects.    Teaching:    I teach both in the Department of Biology and the Department of Mathematics.    Graduate Biology courses include: Statistics in Biology Mathematics in Medicine and Biology Computers in Medicine and Biology    Graduate Mathematics courses include: Mathematical Aspects of Neurophysiology Stochastic Problems in Cellular, Molecular and Neural Science    Biosketch:    I received my Ph.D. in 1981 from the Rockefeller University, where I studied physical chemistry, membrane biophysics, neurophysiology, and mathematics. My dissertation was an analysis of information processing in the outer retina of the turtle. My postdoctoral research was a combined experimental and theoretical study of light adaptation -- a process by which the retina adjusts its sensitivity according to lighting conditions. In 1984, I joined the faculty of New York University with a joint appointment in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Department of Biology.

Other projects include genetic analyses of circadian rhythms, studies of inflammatory effects caused by viral infection, and psychophysical, electrophysiological, and theoretical analyses of visual perception and orientation. Researchers have initiated collaborations with investigators from NYU's Center for Neural Science (CNS) , many of whom hold joint appointments in the Biology Department. These alliances generate excellent opportunities for interactions with researchers in other areas of neurobiology.
