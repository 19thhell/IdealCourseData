Every year, Gallatin offers more than 100 different interdisciplinary seminars in the liberal arts that focus on major issues or themes in\u2014and across\u2014the humanities and arts, social sciences, and sciences. Through interdisciplinary seminars, students encounter a range of important historical periods and fields, and develop a global component to their studies. Gallatin\u2019s expansive notion of the great books distinguishes it from other nontraditional programs as well as from most traditional programs. Interdisciplinary seminars are relatively small (20 to 22 students), emphasizing class discussion and thoughtful writing assignments.

Description       The future is ephemeral, uncertain, and always seems just within reach. Cultures all around the world have developed a dizzying array of tools for divining the future, from reading goat entrails to calculating carbon dioxide concentrations. Prediction spans religious systems, political policy, business trends, and scientific theories. This course examines a variety of practices of prediction from different cultures, historical eras, and academic disciplines. We will assess the kinds of arguments used in prediction, and how evidence is marshaled to know the unknowable. Claims of prediction have high stakes: what we think about the future changes how we act in the present. Readings may include John Calvin, James Hansen, Karl Marx, Nate Silver, Isaac Asimov, the I-Ching, Claudius Ptolemy, Pierre Simon de Laplace, Max Weber, and Oswald Spengler.

Every year, Gallatin offers more than 100 different interdisciplinary seminars in the liberal arts that focus on major issues or themes in\u2014and across\u2014the humanities and arts, social sciences, and sciences. Through interdisciplinary seminars, students encounter a range of important historical periods and fields, and develop a global component to their studies. Gallatin\u2019s expansive notion of the great books distinguishes it from other nontraditional programs as well as from most traditional programs. Interdisciplinary seminars are relatively small (20 to 22 students), emphasizing class discussion and thoughtful writing assignments.

Description       The future is ephemeral, uncertain, and always seems just within reach. Cultures all around the world have developed a dizzying array of tools for divining the future, from reading goat entrails to calculating carbon dioxide concentrations. Prediction spans religious systems, political policy, business trends, and scientific theories. This course examines a variety of practices of prediction from different cultures, historical eras, and academic disciplines. We will assess the kinds of arguments used in prediction, and how evidence is marshaled to know the unknowable. Claims of prediction have high stakes: what we think about the future changes how we act in the present. Readings may include John Calvin, James Hansen, Karl Marx, Nate Silver, Isaac Asimov, the I-Ching, Claudius Ptolemy, Pierre Simon de Laplace, Max Weber, and Oswald Spengler.

Every year, Gallatin offers more than 100 different interdisciplinary seminars in the liberal arts that focus on major issues or themes in\u2014and across\u2014the humanities and arts, social sciences, and sciences. Through interdisciplinary seminars, students encounter a range of important historical periods and fields, and develop a global component to their studies. Gallatin\u2019s expansive notion of the great books distinguishes it from other nontraditional programs as well as from most traditional programs. Interdisciplinary seminars are relatively small (20 to 22 students), emphasizing class discussion and thoughtful writing assignments.

Description       The future is ephemeral, uncertain, and always seems just within reach. Cultures all around the world have developed a dizzying array of tools for divining the future, from reading goat entrails to calculating carbon dioxide concentrations. Prediction spans religious systems, political policy, business trends, and scientific theories. This course examines a variety of practices of prediction from different cultures, historical eras, and academic disciplines. We will assess the kinds of arguments used in prediction, and how evidence is marshaled to know the unknowable. Claims of prediction have high stakes: what we think about the future changes how we act in the present. Readings may include John Calvin, James Hansen, Karl Marx, Nate Silver, Isaac Asimov, the I-Ching, Claudius Ptolemy, Pierre Simon de Laplace, Max Weber, and Oswald Spengler.

First-year students take three courses that constitute the First-Year Program: the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar (which you will take in the fall), and the First-Year Research Seminar (which you will take in the spring). Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays.   Below is a complete list of the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar and First-Year Writing Seminar offerings. Prepare for your pre-registration advising conversations by selecting your top five choices among the First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminars and First-Year Writing Seminars offered for Fall 2015.          The First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar introduces students to the philosophy, goals, and methods of university education and to the interdisciplinary, individualized approach of the Gallatin School. These small classes of about 18 students encourage discussion rather than lecturing and focus on a theme that incorporates significant world texts representing several disciplines.

Each seminar is organized around a particular theme with related readings that serve as springboards for discussion and models for students\u2019 essays. Plan to take a First-Year Writing Seminar in the fall semester; you will take a First-Year Research Seminar next spring.
