Therefore, each ethnography is unique in its focus, method and writing style.

Finished Ethnographies   Aid to Children of Imprisoned Mothers: An Ethnographic Study Aid to Children of Imprisoned Mothers (AIM) By Akinyele Umoja, NYU/LCW Ethnographer   In recent years scholars, authors, and activists have articulated the existence of a generation gap within the African-American community. In the context of the developing generational divide in contemporary African-American social life, this study examines the program Aid to Children of Imprisoned Mothers (AIM) and its successes and challenges in transitioning youth to leadership. This ethnography examines AIM's organizational culture and its ability to transition youth, its staff, volunteers and clients into leadership in partnership with the adult leadership of the program. While the generation gap within the African-American community is a specific issue in the contemporary social context that AIM operates, other issues, particularly negative social forces that reinforce a cycle of incarceration and poverty and the educational and social economic gap between service providers and clients also challenge its goal of meeting the mission stated above.   Complete Ethnography: Aid to Children of Imprisoned Mothers: An Ethnographic Study   L'ideres Campesinas: Grassroots Gendered Leadership, Community Organizing, and Pedagogies of Empowerment Organizaci'on en California de L'ideres Campesinas (OLC)   By Maylei Blackwell, Professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies - University of California, Los Angeles Co-Researchers: Mily Trevi?o Sauceda, Executive Director, L'ideres Campesinas; Devra Weber, Professor of History, University of California, Riverside; and Carol Stack, Ph.D., Advisory Committee   The roots of Organizaci'on en California de L'ideres Campesinas (L'ideres Campesinas) are grounded in farm worker women who create a better future themselves and their communities. The organization is based on the idea that farm worker women are leaders that can be empowered to solve the problems of injustice in their own lives and communities. This ethnography addresses three areas of research, including L'ideres Campesinas's history; changes in terms of leadership, empowerment and community organization; and documenting the organization's pedagogical model. The ethnography chronicles Latina farm workers in California who have developed programs recognizing campesina expertise, nurturing leadership among campesinas who organize their families, communities, and workplaces. These narratives speak to the new forms of empowerment created by L'ideres Campesinas and new tools the women have obtained in creating new kinds of community by taking action in their twelve local site committees.

This initiative engages neighborhood residents, business owners, community groups, and other organizations in revitalizing North Central Philadelphia by recognizing and strengthening the communities existing assets and leadership. The Shared Prosperity model radically refigures the expert/client relationship. Professional planners drawn from the University placed their students in the position of having to learn from members of a steering committee drawn from the neighborhood. This ethnography explores the ways in which the resident-driven steering committee built community around the work of mentoring student planners and volunteers, reclaiming and beautifying neighborhood spaces, utilizing volunteers to survey the community, retrieving memories of community elders, and reinhabiting the public space of the streets. In this model, economic revitalization grows out of the revitalized life of the community, which leverages recognition and support from the larger polities of metropolis and state.   Practitioner Guide: Piecing Together the Fragments Practitioner Guide in Spanish: Uniendos los fragmentos Complete Ethnography: Piecing Together the Fragments   Until All of Us Are Home: The Process of Leadership at Project H.O.M.E. Project H.O.M.E.   By Kathleen Hall, Associate Professor, University of Pennsylvania   Project H.O.M.E.'s co-founders, S. Mary Scullion and Joan Dawson McConnon together with members of the Project H.O.M.E. community explores the emergence of leadership through struggle in the fight to end homelessness in Philadelphia. It has been within struggles for recovery and family unification, fair housing and equality, human dignity and cohesion in diversity that leaders have arisen and flourished at every level of the organization. This ethnographic study documents the organization's history of leadership through struggle. Having looked back across time, the co-researchers gathered oral history interviews and documentary photographs to chronicle the stories of those who have shared in the struggles, the challenges, and the ultimate success of Project H.O.M.E.   Practitioner Guide: Until All of Us Are Home Practitioner Guide in Spanish: Hasta que todos tengamos techo Complete Ethnography: Until All of Us Are Home     Leadership Development for Community Action: An Ethnographic Inquiry Northwest Federation of Community Organizations By Lisa Weinberg, Organizational Consultant Addendum By Meredith Herr, NYU/LCW, and Erica Gabrielle Foldy, NYU/LCW   Co-researchers: LeeAnn Hall, Award Recipient, Lisa Weinberg, Organizational Consultant   LeeAnn Hall directs the Northwest Federation of Community Organizations (NWFCO), a collaboration of four state-based community organizations engaged in the fight for social and economic justice. Leadership development is at the heart of the NWFCO mission and central to LeeAnn's own leadership style. Through training and issue-specific campaigns, NWFCO and its affiliated organizations build grassroots capacity to effect social change. The ethnography focuses on the very personal process by which people begin to self-identify and act as leaders. It explores what enables people to envision a different future, both in terms of what they can do and to what ends. The results of this research illuminate what it takes to foster and sustain a sense of efficacy and a commitment to action.   Complete Ethnography: Leadership Development for Community Action Addendum: The Political Project of Learning   Building Alliances: An Ethnography of Collaboration between Rural Organizing Project (ROP) and CAUSA in Oregon By Lynn Stephen, University of Oregon; in collaboration with Jan Lanier, PCUN; Ram?n Ram?rez, Award Recipient; and Marcy Westerling, Award Recipient   This ethnography examines the components that allow quality solidarity work to happen between organizations with leadership and constituencies that are primarily people of color and primarily white, respectively. PCUN and ROP of Oregon have developed a working relationship over ten years that has contributed to numerous victories for immigrant and farm worker rights, as well as greater consciousness among white, rural activists around what it means to provide support as anti-racist allies. Because Oregon has a relatively small population (3 million), and progressive organizations tend to know each other, the relationship provides an opportunity to study how such organizations manage power and historic inequalities in a manner suited for success. Ethnographer Lynn Stephen has conducted in-depth interviews with organizational leaders and members as a way to explore the history and lessons learned from the collaborative work between the two organizations. Key findings include the importance of in-depth and sustained dialogue around the key values of work, and staff training around the issues involved with connecting to the other organization. The organizations use these techniques build common ground. Hence, collaborative capacity can be mobilized quickly to support each other's actions as needed.   Practitioner Guide: Building Alliances Practitioner Guide in Spanish: Formaci'on de alianzas Overview and Highlights: Building Alliances Complete Ethnography: Building Alliances   Waging Democracy in the Kingdom of Coal OVEC and the Movement for Social and Environmental Justice in Central Appalachia   By Mary Hufford, Center for Folklore and Ethnography - University of Pennsylvania   Co-Researchers: Janet Fout, Award Recipient; Dianne Bady, Award Recipient; Mary Hufford, Center for Folklore and Ethnography - University of Pennsylvania   This ethnography explores how Janet Fout, Dianne Bady and their original co-founder Laura Foreman built the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition (OVEC). This diverse, grassroots effort in the coalfields of West Virginia focuses on stopping mountaintop removal, a practice in which mine companies literally blow the tops off mountains as a way of getting to the coal inside. This destroys mountains, forests, streams, wildlife habitat and communities. The ethnography also explores how OVEC builds political relationships that are spiritual, communitarian and democratic.   Complete Ethnography: Waging Democracy in the Kingdom of Coal   Each One Teach One: Learning Leadership at TROSA Triangle Residential Option for Substance Abusers (TROSA) By Barbara Lau, Center for Documentary Studies - Duke University   Co-Researchers: Kevin McDonald, Award Recipient; Barbara Lau, Center for Documentary Studies - Duke University   Kevin McDonald knows that it will not be possible to replicate TROSA, which uses a social entrepreneurial model to provide services for substance abusers. But he wants to enable others to learn from both his successes and missteps. This ethnography outlines TROSA's unique vision and methods. It explores how the organization practices leadership development as part of everyday life. In addition, photographer Cedric N. Chatterley developed a photo exhibit, Each One Teach One: Learning Leadership at TROSA, and an archive of photographs for TROSA to use in their communications and marketing efforts. Kevin believes that this project allowed him to reflect on his organization's growth and maturity and hopes it will be a useful tool for teaching others.   Complete ethnography: Each One Teach One TROSA photo exhibit   Ethnographies in Progress   National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON) The need to have representation and protection of day laborer rights gave rise to the National Day Labor Organizing Network (NDLON). Day labor is a burgeoning market and serves an important niche for immigrant workers. Organizers who work with day laborers have begun to strategize and build a network of organizations and leaders who are undertaking impressive campaigns to transform the work and lives of day laborers. This ethnographic study documents and researches this adaptation vis-?-vis NDLON, focusing on leadership development under adverse circumstances. This study addresses NDLON's organizational goals, leadership development techniques, popular education, the role of culture in this process, and how to enhance the strategic value of day labor leaders. Additionally, the ethnography conceptualizes how individuals of different backgrounds have adapted their leadership development to life in America. This proposal outlines the leadership development activity occurring across the Network and explains how NDLON contributes to the development stages of organizers and day laborers at each level.

Key findings include the importance of in-depth and sustained dialogue around the key values of work, and staff training around the issues involved with connecting to the other organization. The organizations use these techniques build common ground. Hence, collaborative capacity can be mobilized quickly to support each other's actions as needed.

This diverse, grassroots effort in the coalfields of West Virginia focuses on stopping mountaintop removal, a practice in which mine companies literally blow the tops off mountains as a way of getting to the coal inside. This destroys mountains, forests, streams, wildlife habitat and communities. The ethnography also explores how OVEC builds political relationships that are spiritual, communitarian and democratic.

But he wants to enable others to learn from both his successes and missteps. This ethnography outlines TROSA's unique vision and methods. It explores how the organization practices leadership development as part of everyday life. In addition, photographer Cedric N. Chatterley developed a photo exhibit, Each One Teach One: Learning Leadership at TROSA, and an archive of photographs for TROSA to use in their communications and marketing efforts. Kevin believes that this project allowed him to reflect on his organization's growth and maturity and hopes it will be a useful tool for teaching others.

Day labor is a burgeoning market and serves an important niche for immigrant workers. Organizers who work with day laborers have begun to strategize and build a network of organizations and leaders who are undertaking impressive campaigns to transform the work and lives of day laborers. This ethnographic study documents and researches this adaptation vis-?-vis NDLON, focusing on leadership development under adverse circumstances. This study addresses NDLON's organizational goals, leadership development techniques, popular education, the role of culture in this process, and how to enhance the strategic value of day labor leaders. Additionally, the ethnography conceptualizes how individuals of different backgrounds have adapted their leadership development to life in America. This proposal outlines the leadership development activity occurring across the Network and explains how NDLON contributes to the development stages of organizers and day laborers at each level.

The faculty also believes that basic ethnography remains the cornerstone on which all cultural anthropology rests and are concerned with the representation of anthropological knowledge in writing and film. There is a commitment to an understanding of complex societies that is informed by a comparative perspective and knowledge of smaller-scale settings. Recent field research by faculty and students has been conducted in East and West Africa, North and South America (including research among Native Americans), Australia, the Caribbean, Eastern and Western Europe, Melanesia, the Middle East, Polynesia, South Asia, and the former Soviet Union. Faculty interests converge around gender relations, emotion, religion and belief systems, expressive culture and performance, the anthropology of history, colonialism and post-colonial nationalism, the cultural context of legal and political institutions, transnational processes, and urban life. Much faculty research focuses on the mediation of identities though popular and public cultural forms - such as art, television, indigenous media, urban space, regional cultures, and ideologies of language use - in a variety of changing social contexts.    Sociocultural Anthropology Mission Statement Sociocultural anthropology, which we understand to include linguistic anthropology, is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the nation-state to theorizations about culture and power. New challenges have emerged as public debates about multiculturalism, and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology. These are not \"business-as-usual\" times in the academy, in anthropology, or in the world, if ever there were such times. Questions about cultural processes and theorizing about \"human nature\" escape the boundaries of anthropology as a discipline. The major paradigms framing cultural difference and human universals are profoundly contested; migrations, political collapses and social reorganizations transform the context in which the production of cultural meanings and theories of culture have been embedded and reproduced. For many of us, this is a moment in which it is necessary to take up the sort of broad challenges with which our disciplinary predecessors struggled -- to redefine the field of inquiry and research in relation to debates that have enormous significance in our own lives and those of the people we study. Like our colleagues elsewhere, we are working to place contemporary social anthropological practice in the cross-currents of a burgeoning interest in culture and cultural differences. This is part of the changing historical conditions of the analysis of cultural practice in anthropology, shaped by a shifting of boundaries between those who study and those who are the objects of study, as well as the reorganization of disciplines and their location in the world. Our collective enterprise is to help make an anthropology that grapples with the changing situations of contemporary life. The worlds in which we work, both inside the academic institution and outside, demand more than ever a rethinking of basic concepts and methods and formulation of research projects to engage a range of changing ethnographic objects. At NYU there has been extraordinary cooperation in engaging with these issues, reformulating anthropological traditions of study in order to conceive new problems and comprehend changing circumstances in the world outside the academy. However much anthropology might need to be transformed in the light of criticism, what holds us together is a firm grounding in the traditions and methods of the field focusing on two key disciplinary commitments. The first is the commitment to \"fieldwork\" -- a coeval presence with social actors -- as a way of challenging one's embeddedness in systems of theoretical knowledge. We recognize the need to retheorize this kind of practice, but continue to regard it as the foundation of anthropological knowledge. The second commitment is to the study of cultural processes and practices through which human action is individually and collectively mediated -- that is, to the study of people doing things, of action and practices, rather than the study of culture as an object. Our interest is in how actors (or agents) constitute themselves and organize social life with particular attention to material culture, performance, and expressive media. Some of us began our research careers with ethnography in small-scale societies, but we all recognize the difficulty of any anthropological project now that would disregard the way such social worlds are embedded in economic, political, and cultural processes of a larger order. The shared project of the sociocultural faculty concerns the problems of how to develop an anthropological approach to such complex sociocultural phenomena. There has clearly been a movement among students and faculty to pursue research at the level of what are commonly known as \"complex societies,\" and especially an interest in the development of anthropological approaches to the study of \u2018Western\u2019 society (France, Spain, the U.S.), but we are deeply committed to the view that such study should be informed by a comparative perspective and the knowledge of small-scale societies developed within anthropology. The faculty believes that basic ethnography remains the cornerstone on which all cultural anthropology rests; that study and research must be firmly grounded in rigorous training in general social and cultural theory, both in contemporary writings and in the classics of anthropology and sociology; and that we need to examine what is at stake in representations of anthropological knowledge in writing and media. A distinctive emphasis has emerged in this department around the study of \"cultural mediations\": religion, ritual, language, art, poetry, indigenous and mass media, music, and cultural spectacles -- as they mediate social relations at many levels of social action. Faculty interests fall into three interrelated configurations. The first concerns the study of a range of signifying practices--language, emotion and personhood, art and material culture, media, museums, music and popular culture, religion and ritual, and history and \"social memory.\" These interests intersect with a second configuration around urban space, nationalism, historical processes, cultural policy, language ideology, social movements, and transnational processes such as migration, the circulation and consumption of cultural capital, and tourism. Faculty and student research that has focused on the mediation of national, diasporic, and indigenous identities through popular and public cultural forms in a variety of changing social contexts has brought many of us to participate in both of these configurations. The development of the Program in Culture and Media -- with its rigorous training in theory, production, and ethnography of media -- has been a particularly vital component of this configuration, as a site for rethinking the relationships among different kinds of cultural production. A third configuration is now being developed by several faculty in Medical Anthropology and Science Studies. Ongoing research projects are examining the intersection of reproductive technologies and the medicalization of social practices; the construction of genetic knowledge in labs, clinics, and genetic support groups; the social construction of diagnoses of emotion-related disorders and their relationship to the production of psychotropic drugs; ways in which social formations come to grips with the revolution in genetics and the effects of the production and dissemination of new scientific knowledge; and the remaking of the public sphere -- from policy to social movements -- as new media, information technologies and neo-liberal economies transform these arenas. Crosscutting all of these configurations is a record of strength and continuing work in linguistic anthropology, feminist anthropology and gender and sexuality studies. Departmental emphases draw on the great benefits that come from being at a large, first-rate urban university. We have important cross-disciplinary formations in area studies (the Institute of French Studies, The Center for Caribbean and Latin American Studies, the Kevorkian Center and Middle East Studies, Africana Studies, Asian/Pacific American Studies, American Studies, and East Asian Studies) as well as in other areas including our collaborative arrangements with Cinema Studies and the Film School; Museum Studies; Linguistics; and the Institute for the History of the Production of Knowledge--giving students access to a broad range of expertise.  Special Resources and Facilities in Sociocultural Anthropology The Annette B. Weiner Fellowship in Cultural Anthropology supports   ethnographic fieldwork by graduate students in the Department of   Anthropology. The fellowship carries on the inspiration and dedication   that Annette Weiner gave to the field of anthropology, so that her   vision will be carried forward to the next generation. Applications for   the fellowship are invited each April. Doctoral students who anticipate   doing socio-cultural or linguistic fieldwork in the upcoming year and   who wish to be considered should normally submit a recent example of a   fieldwork grant application. Post-Master's preliminary fieldwork   applications will be considered, but on a lesser order of priority.
