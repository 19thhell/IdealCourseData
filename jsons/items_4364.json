Center for Neuroeconomics  The Center for Neuroeconomics at New York University is one of the preeminent  institutions for the study of decision making and the brain. The Center  brings together faculty and students from NYU's world-class departments  of Neural Science, Economics and Psychology in classes, seminars  and research groups.          Emotional Brain Institute  The Emotional Brain Institute (EBI) is a joint initiative between New  York University and New York State. The goal of EBI is to understand  emotions and their impact on mind and behavior. A multi-disciplinary  group of researchers is investigating the origins of normal and  pathological emotions from the level of mind and behavior to neural  systems, cell activity, molecules, and genes. In researching these  topics, EBI investigators use state of the art approaches in the study  of brain, mind, and behavior.* *EBI researchers are located at the   Washington Square Campus of NYU and the   NYU Langone  School of Medicine , both in Manhattan, and the   Nathan Kline Institute , in Orangeburg, NY.
