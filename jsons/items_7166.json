Modern Western culture, in this sense, is heir to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who began his\u00a0 Confessions \u00a0by claiming, \u201cI know my heart, and have studied mankind; I am not made like any one I have been acquainted with, perhaps like no one in existence.\u201d Earlier writers of autobiographies were inclined to identify themselves as one of many sinners or subjects rather than one-of-a-kind. Rousseau\u2019s self-assertion was radical in its time but he spoke for an era that would come to depict growing up as the discovery of personal knowledge and associate maturity with the attainment of individuality and self-sufficiency. Central to that cultural historical trend was the emergence of the modern novel as a major literary form. In hindsight, the novel seems to have been custom-made for readers seeking narratives of heightened subjectivity and singular stories that were truly \u201cnovel\u201d\u2014new, unforeseen, ostensibly non-formulaic. In this class we will closely read and discuss texts that reveal how individuality came to be regarded as a felt, acquired, universal experience and pay particular attention to the novel's role in the formation of the new subjectivity. We will consider questions about what was lost and gained as writers struggled with tradition and social awareness to filter everything through a singular consciousness. Possible readings include a few specimens of 18th century philosophy (Rousseau\u2019s\u00a0 Essay on Inequality \u00a0, Kant\u2019s &quot;What Is Enlightenment?&quot;) and popular writing (Samuel Smiles\u2019s\u00a0 Self-Help \u00a0) as well as literary texts (Wordsworth\u2019s autobiographical verse, Austen\u2019s\u00a0 Emma \u00a0, Shelley\u2019s\u00a0 Frankenstein \u00a0, Dickens\u2019s\u00a0 Great Expectations \u00a0, Flaubert\u2019s\u00a0 Sentimental Education \u00a0, Dostoyevsky\u2019s\u00a0 Notes from Underground \u00a0, selections from Whitman, Ibsen\u2019s\u00a0 Hedda Gabler \u00a0and\u00a0 A Doll\u2019s House \u00a0).
