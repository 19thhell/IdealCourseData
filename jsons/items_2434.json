It will examine how nineteenth century practitioners worked the genre didactically and aesthetically to establish a common Latin American imaginary, to educate a burgeoning reading public in worldly tastes and cosmopolitanisms, to take up hemispheric political problems, and to focus on the problems of uneven modernity and the comparative anxieties of Latin Americans looking to Europe and the United Status as models of progress, development and democracy. We will also consider how the chronicle as a journalistic form emphazies a documentary imperative and competes with photography as primary material and cultural currency. In the second half of the course, we will explore the twentieth century journalism of \u201cmaster novelists\u201d whose previous incarnations as journalists shaped their work and consider their literary experiments beyond their conventional interpretations. We will think about the force of photography and visual culture in non-fiction writing, and consider how movements like modernism, surrealism, new journalism and the marvelous real participate in a mutualistic relationship with the cronica as a journalistic and literary form. Finally we will read recent works whose authors exploit the cronicas liminal generic status to invent a new narrative transit between literature, journalism, and historiography while competing with and assimilating the aesthetics and representational force of photography and cinema. A photographic anthology will often accompany the weekly readings.                   Back to Top                     Contact us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

Devices provide us with the rules--for geographical orientation, for dating, for knowing the weather. Do we use our devices, or do they use us? The question is old, and this course looks at cultures of machines from the Early Modern period to the present. It will proceed thematically, treating problems in historical technological cultures like computers (Pascal, Babbage, Kittler), automata (Vaucanson, Hoffmann, Helmholtz, Merimee, \u010capek), divine machines (Leibniz, Jean Paul, Wiener, G\u00fcnther), the advent of film (M\u00fcnsterberg, Lang, Benjamin), animals/humans and \"the tool\" (Geroi-Lourhan, Heidegger, Darwin/Marx, Engels, Kapp, Samuel Butler) and the so-called \"megamachine\" of modern society (J\u00fcnger, Mumford). The framework will be the negative anthropology tradition between Herder and Gehlen and the reversal of the myth from the extension of human powers to the primacy of the technological. The shared conviction of nearly all these authors is that culture must reflect on its machines--and on itself as a machine-like entity--in order to survive.
