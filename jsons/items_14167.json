(Equivalent names  sometimes used are financial engineering, mathematical finance, and  computational finance.) It draws on tools from applied mathematics,  computer science, statistics, and economic theory. Investment banks,  commercial banks, hedge funds, insurance companies, corporate  treasuries, and regulatory agencies apply the methods of financial  mathematics to such problems as derivative securities valuation,  portfolio structuring, risk management, and scenario simulation.  Quantitative analysis has brought efficiency and rigor to financial  markets and to the investment process and is becoming increasingly  important in regulatory concerns. As the pace of financial innovation  increases, the need for highly qualified people with specific training  in financial mathematics intensifies.       Finance as a sub-field of economics concerns itself with  the valuation of assets and financial instruments as well as the  allocation of resources. Centuries of history and experience have  produced fundamental theories about the way economies function and the  way we value assets. Mathematics comes into play because it allows  theoreticians to model the relationships between variables and  represent  randomness in a manner that can lead to useful analysis. Mathematics,  then, becomes a tool chest from which researchers can draw to solve  problems, provide insights and make the intractable model tractable.       Mathematical finance draws from the disciplines of  probability theory, statistics, scientific computing and partial  differential equations to provide models and derive relationships  between fundamental variables such as asset prices, market movements  and interest rates. These mathematical tools allow us to draw  conclusions that can be otherwise difficult to find or not immediately  obvious from intuition. Especially with the aid of modern computational  techniques, we can store vast quantities of data and model many  variables simultaneously, leading to the ability to model quite large  and complicated systems. Thus the techniques of scientific computing,  such as numerical computations, Monte Carlo simulation and optimization  are an important part of financial mathematics.       A large part of any science is the ability to create  testable hypotheses based on a fundamental understanding of the objects  of study and prove or contradict the hypotheses through repeatable  studies. In this light, mathematics is a language for representing  theories and provides tools for testing their validity. For example, in  the theory of option pricing due to Black, Scholes and Merton, a model  for the movement of stock prices is posited, and in conjunction with  basic theory which states that a riskless investment will receive the  risk-free rate of return, the researchers reasoned that a value can be  assigned to an option that is independent of the expected future value  of the stock.       This theory, for which Scholes and Merton were awarded  the Nobel prize, is an excellent illustration of the interaction  between math and financial theory, which ultimately led to a surprising  insight into the nature of option prices. The mathematical contribution  was the basic stochastic model (Geometric Brownian motion) for stock  price movements and the partial differential equation and its solution  providing the relationship between the option's value and other market  variables. Their analysis also provided a completely specified strategy  for managing option investment which permits practical testing of the  model's consequences. This theory, which would not have been possible  without the fundamental participation of mathematics, today plays an  essential role in a trillion dollar industry.

In recent years we have seen an increase in the demand for analytical skills in the financial service industries. Understanding recent developments in financial markets and products requires a degree of sophistication not only in finance, but also in stochastic processes, statistics, and applied economics. Courses within both finance and statistics allow students to pursue advanced work in these areas. The financial instruments taught prepare students to enter the financial world with knowledge of still-developing assessment techniques.
