The Center\u2019s goal is to develop and broaden interdisciplinary and cross-cultural scholarship, pedagogy, and public knowledge of religion and media at New York University. While this project was conceived before September 11, that event and its aftermath have dramatized the need for understanding the spread of religious ideas and practices through a variety of media. The Center is a joint project of the Religious Studies Program (Angela Zito, Director) and the Center for Media, Culture, and History , (Faye Ginsburg, Director, Pegi Vail, Director of Public Programing). Ann Neumann is the editor of the Center's innovative web journal, The Revealer: A Daily Review of Religion and the Press . The Center started officially in May 2003. In the summer of 2003, they collaborated with Diana Taylor and the Hemispheric Institute of Performance and Politics at NYU in hosting an international \u201cencuentro\u201d on Spectacles of Religiosity: Religious Mediation in the Americas . Each year the center focuses on a specific theme, hosting several Working Groups and planning public events that will illuminate its issues: In 2003/2004 the annual theme was Confession, Testimony, Witnessing . In May 2004 they hosted a three-day interdisciplinary conference: Religious Witness: the Intimate, the Everyday, and the World . For 2004\u20132005, the annual theme was Religious Experience: Memory, Media, Marketing . In May 2005, they presented, along with the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of the American Indian, The Museum of Modern Art First Nations/First Features: A Showcase of World Indigenous Film and Media . For 2005\u20132006, as they started the year themed Religion, Media, and Body Politics , they were faced with the disastrous human response to the disaster of Hurricane Katrina. They immediately began planning a May 2006 conference called Body Counts/Bodies Count . The theme for 2006-2007 was Secularization, Media and the Globalization of Religion. A range of challenges to \"secularism\" emerging in contemporary forms of religious community and identity position themselves within and against secular regimes associated with modernity. We explored various media through which these challenges are mounted, pursued, and performed, and through which they acquire social weight. The theme for 2007-2008 was Religion and the Politics of Culture . The theme for 2008-2009 was Culture, Religion, and the Politics of Change The theme for the fall of 2009 was Memory, Media, and Cultural Creativity The theme for the spring of 2010 was Media, Religion, and New Cultural Imaginaries    Religion, Media and Social Transformation has been the ongoing theme in our most recent years.

Students study the theories and methods by which religion is analyzed today, including psychological, sociological, anthropological, hermeneutic, philosophical, historical, legal and literary work. They also approach the study of \"religion\" as a concept, which has itself been an intellectual object of inquiry, and has played a key role in the development of the social and human sciences. Second, students learn empirically about religion in different times and places either through historical or ethnographic study , using textual, visual and audio sources. Third, approached as lived practices, religions present us with a valuable lens through which many realms in social life can be examined: gender and sexuality, race, the nation-state, violence, memory, ethics, emotions, politics, economy, power, art, literature and media. These realms, in turn, impact upon religions. It should be stressed that the program is oriented towards the academic study of religious phenomena and does not promote or endorse either religious belief itself or the views of any particular religious tradition. The program makes use of resources from several areas of study in the College. Courses may be taught by scholars of Anthropology, Classics, English, Fine Arts, French, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, Music, Performance Studies, Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literature, and other academic disciplines.      The Master's Degree in Religious Studies           The Master's in Religious Studies is perfect for students looking for a \"bridge\" M.A. program to doctoral studies; current and prospective teachers; and students preparing for professional careers in law, social work, journalism, counseling, medicine, civil service, politics, and ministry.
