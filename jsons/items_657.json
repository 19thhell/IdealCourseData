Utopia, Apocalypse, and the Millennium RUSSN-UA 833 Offered every other year. Borenstein. 4 points . The development of utopianism in literature, philosophy, and political theory, as well as attempts to put utopian theory into action. What does it mean to posit a perfect world, and what is the relationship between such an ideal world and our less-than-perfect reality? What are the impulses behind anti-utopianism? The recent resurgence of utopianism and apocalypticism is examined (for example, millenarian \u201ccults,\u201d the millennium bug). Readings include Plato, More, Bellamy, Dostoevsky, Marx, Zamyatin, Orwell, Huxley, LeGuin, and Revelation. Chekhov RUSSN-UA 837 Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of major techniques in Chekhov\u2019s short story writing; analysis of his influence on the development of the Russian and European novella; a close analysis of Chekhov\u2019s drama (Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard, and Uncle Vanya) and its impact on Russian playwrights of the 20th century, as well as its relation to the development of Stanislavsky\u2019s Moscow Art Theatre. Dostoevsky RUSSN-UA 839 Offered every other year. 4 points. The major philosophical and religious themes of Dostoevsky as they are reflected in his works. Notes from the Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov, and major short stories form the main part of the course. Examines Dostoevsky\u2019s concepts of freedom, history, and Christianity. Theory of the Avant-Garde, East and West, 1890\u20131930 RUSSN-UA 841 Identical to COLIT-UA 841, ENGL-UA 730 . Offered every other year. 4 points.   Theory and practice of the European avant-garde in art and literature, 1890\u20131930. General cultural and historical approach to the avant-garde, with close readings of some of its key productions. Topics: cubism, Italian futurism, Russian cubo-futurism, imagism and vorticism, dadaism, constructivism, and surrealism. Stresses aesthetic, historical, and political interconnections between the Russian avant-garde and the West. Readings are in English, but comparative literature majors are encouraged to read works in the original language. Russian Literature in the Original I RUSSN-UA 847 Prerequisite: at least one semester of Advanced Russian or near-native fluency in Russian. Offered in the fall. 4 points. Students read Russian prose and poetry in the original language. Class discussions and papers are also in Russian. Russian Literature in the Original II RUSSN-UA 848 Prerequisite: at least one semester of Advanced Russian or near-native fluency in Russian. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Students read Russian prose and poetry in the original language. Class discussions and papers are also in Russian. Introduction to Soviet Cinema RUSSN-UA 850 Offered every year. Iampolski. 4 points. An examination of the history of Russian cinema from its beginnings. The main focus is on landmarks of cinematic art and on the cultural specificity of Russian cinema. The survey also includes questions of cinema and politics (cinema as a propaganda tool), and cinema and the market. Artists discussed include Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin, Kuleshov, Barnet, Shub, Kozintsev, Trauberg, and Tarkovsky. Topics include cinema and revolution, the cinema of the Russian avant-garde and constructivism, cinema and totalitarianism, and socialist realism in film. Soviet and Post-Soviet Literature RUSSN-UA 852 Offered every other year. Borenstein. 4 points. An introduction to Russian 20th-century fiction, concentrating on the two periods of greatest cultural ferment: 1920s modernism and late/post-Soviet postmodernism. After the 1917 revolution, Bolshevik ideology held that the Old World would be utterly destroyed, to be replaced by a new society populated by New Soviet Men. The experience of Russia in the 20th century can be viewed as the failed attempt to put radical theory into everyday practice, a grand scheme of social engineering that would inevitably be reflected in the country\u2019s literature. Legacies of Serfdom and Slavery in Russian and American Literature RUSSN-UA 854 Offered every other year. Lounsbery. 4 points. Readings and discussions address how American slaves and Russian serfs wrote and were written about in the two countries\u2019 literary traditions. Topics include both the ways in which subjugated people attempted to represent themselves to the dominant culture and the difficulties that members of the dominant culture confronted in writing about people whose experiences were largely inaccessible to them. Particular attention is paid to how categories such as \u201cslave,\u201d \u201cpeasant,\u201d \u201cwhite,\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d have changed over time and to how unfree people worked to turn what were perceived as cultural lacks into aesthetic advantages. 20th-Century Russia: Terror, Survival, and Beautiful Dreams RUSSN-UA 859 Offered every other year. 4 points. Encompasses the last years of the tsars and the Russian Revolution. Major events and phenomena are carefully analyzed through general readings and use of diverse media such as film, literature, visual art, and music: Lenin and communism; Stalinism; the Second World War; the end of Communism and the transition to capitalism. Paradox is at the center of this analysis: a fundamentally humanistic ideology of Communism produced one of the most murderous regimes of the century; an international movement became increasingly chauvinistic and nationalistic; a full-blown welfare state also oppressed its population in unprecedented ways. Theories of Symbolic Exchange RUSSN-UA 860 Offered periodically. 4 points. In his seminal essay \u2018On the Gift\u201d (1923) Marcel Mauss developed a concept of an alternative, non-market type of economy. This economy is based on a non-monetary exchange of such symbolic values as social recognition, sovereignty and political participation. Today, this concept of the non-monetary exchange has acquired a new relevance \u2013 especially, in relationship to the economy of the Internet. This course examines various theories of the symbolic that expand the original Maussian model and encompass multiple aspects of culture: from Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois and Mikhail Bakhtin to Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard. Russia and the West RUSSN-UA 861 Offered every spring. 4 points. There are few problems as enduring and central to Russian history as the question of the West \u2013 Russia\u2019s most passionate romance and most bitter letdown. In this seminar we will read and think about Russian culture from the 17th to the 20th centuries through the lens of this obsession. The course will focus on the transfer of ideas and migrant communities. We will study the intellectual products of Russian interactions with the West \u2013 constitutional projects, scientific and economic thought, the Westernizer-Slavophile controversy, and revolutions. Substantial emphasis will be placed on the role of reading and translation in the making of cultural models: Russian Byronism, Russian Hamletism. More than ideas, the West came embodied in real people. We will consider the presence of European communities in Russia: German and British migrants who filled important niches in state service, trade, and scholarship; Italian sculptors and architects who designed some of Russia\u2019s most famous and symbolically potent monuments; Parisian aristocratic expatriates in the wake of the French Revolution; Communist workers and intellectuals, refugees from Nazi Germany; and foreign journalists who, in the late Soviet decades, trafficked illicit ideas, texts, and artworks. In the end, we will follow Russians into successive waves of emigration to Europe and the United States. Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace RUSSN-UA 862 Offered every three years. 4 points. This seminar is devoted to Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace. Our first priority will be a careful reading of Tolstoy\u2019s massive novel (if it is in fact a \u201cnovel\u201d: this is one of the questions we will address), with the goal of understanding how the text works and the techniques it uses in order to make possible the immersive pleasures it offers to readers. We will also consider the book\u2019s historical context; the sources that Tolstoy drew on; its place in Tolstoy\u2019s oeuvre and thought; its place in the Russian tradition and in \u201cworld\u201d literature; and the various uses (including political and ideological) that have been made of it since its initial publication. The Unquiet Dead: Imagining the Afterlife in Film and Fiction RUSSN-UA 870 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the connections between narrative and imagined scenarios for the afterlife. As we examine the literary and cinematic treatments of vampires, ghosts, zombies, and, in particular, posthumous narrators, we will look at the political and ideological deployment of afterlife narratives, investigating questions of cultural and sexual purity, collective guilt, and socioeconomic anxiety. Particular attention is paid to the folklore and fiction of the Slavic world, as well as to contemporary American reinterpretations. Readings will include texts by Nabokov, Gogol, Ovid, Stoker, and Morrison, accompanied by selected films. Internship and Independent Study Courses Open only to students majoring in the department.

Contemporary Central and East European Literature RUSSN-UA 832 Offered every other year. Borenstein. 4 points. An examination of contemporary novels and short stories from Central and Eastern Europe (Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, the former Yugoslavia, Albania, and Hungary), primarily the literature of the last 50 years. The problems of \u201cminor\u201d literature, postmodernism, and the attempt to articulate \u201cauthentic\u201d experience are emphasized. Authors read include Kafka, Kundera, Hrabal, Kosinski, Schulz, Gombrowicz, Kristof, Kadare, Kis, Pavic, and Ugresvi. All works are read in translation. Utopia, Apocalypse, and the Millennium RUSSN-UA 833 Offered every other year. Borenstein. 4 points . The development of utopianism in literature, philosophy, and political theory, as well as attempts to put utopian theory into action. What does it mean to posit a perfect world, and what is the relationship between such an ideal world and our less-than-perfect reality? What are the impulses behind anti-utopianism? The recent resurgence of utopianism and apocalypticism is examined (for example, millenarian \u201ccults,\u201d the millennium bug). Readings include Plato, More, Bellamy, Dostoevsky, Marx, Zamyatin, Orwell, Huxley, LeGuin, and Revelation. Chekhov RUSSN-UA 837 Offered every other year. 4 points. Study of major techniques in Chekhov\u2019s short story writing; analysis of his influence on the development of the Russian and European novella; a close analysis of Chekhov\u2019s drama (Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard, and Uncle Vanya) and its impact on Russian playwrights of the 20th century, as well as its relation to the development of Stanislavsky\u2019s Moscow Art Theatre. Dostoevsky RUSSN-UA 839 Offered every other year. 4 points. The major philosophical and religious themes of Dostoevsky as they are reflected in his works. Notes from the Underground, Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov, and major short stories form the main part of the course. Examines Dostoevsky\u2019s concepts of freedom, history, and Christianity. Theory of the Avant-Garde, East and West, 1890\u20131930 RUSSN-UA 841 Identical to COLIT-UA 841, ENGL-UA 730 . Offered every other year. 4 points.   Theory and practice of the European avant-garde in art and literature, 1890\u20131930. General cultural and historical approach to the avant-garde, with close readings of some of its key productions. Topics: cubism, Italian futurism, Russian cubo-futurism, imagism and vorticism, dadaism, constructivism, and surrealism. Stresses aesthetic, historical, and political interconnections between the Russian avant-garde and the West. Readings are in English, but comparative literature majors are encouraged to read works in the original language. Russian Literature in the Original I RUSSN-UA 847 Prerequisite: at least one semester of Advanced Russian or near-native fluency in Russian. Offered in the fall. 4 points. Students read Russian prose and poetry in the original language. Class discussions and papers are also in Russian. Russian Literature in the Original II RUSSN-UA 848 Prerequisite: at least one semester of Advanced Russian or near-native fluency in Russian. Offered in the spring. 4 points. Students read Russian prose and poetry in the original language. Class discussions and papers are also in Russian. Introduction to Soviet Cinema RUSSN-UA 850 Offered every year. Iampolski. 4 points. An examination of the history of Russian cinema from its beginnings. The main focus is on landmarks of cinematic art and on the cultural specificity of Russian cinema. The survey also includes questions of cinema and politics (cinema as a propaganda tool), and cinema and the market. Artists discussed include Eisenstein, Vertov, Pudovkin, Kuleshov, Barnet, Shub, Kozintsev, Trauberg, and Tarkovsky. Topics include cinema and revolution, the cinema of the Russian avant-garde and constructivism, cinema and totalitarianism, and socialist realism in film. Soviet and Post-Soviet Literature RUSSN-UA 852 Offered every other year. Borenstein. 4 points. An introduction to Russian 20th-century fiction, concentrating on the two periods of greatest cultural ferment: 1920s modernism and late/post-Soviet postmodernism. After the 1917 revolution, Bolshevik ideology held that the Old World would be utterly destroyed, to be replaced by a new society populated by New Soviet Men. The experience of Russia in the 20th century can be viewed as the failed attempt to put radical theory into everyday practice, a grand scheme of social engineering that would inevitably be reflected in the country\u2019s literature. Legacies of Serfdom and Slavery in Russian and American Literature RUSSN-UA 854 Offered every other year. Lounsbery. 4 points. Readings and discussions address how American slaves and Russian serfs wrote and were written about in the two countries\u2019 literary traditions. Topics include both the ways in which subjugated people attempted to represent themselves to the dominant culture and the difficulties that members of the dominant culture confronted in writing about people whose experiences were largely inaccessible to them. Particular attention is paid to how categories such as \u201cslave,\u201d \u201cpeasant,\u201d \u201cwhite,\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d have changed over time and to how unfree people worked to turn what were perceived as cultural lacks into aesthetic advantages. 20th-Century Russia: Terror, Survival, and Beautiful Dreams RUSSN-UA 859 Offered every other year. 4 points. Encompasses the last years of the tsars and the Russian Revolution. Major events and phenomena are carefully analyzed through general readings and use of diverse media such as film, literature, visual art, and music: Lenin and communism; Stalinism; the Second World War; the end of Communism and the transition to capitalism. Paradox is at the center of this analysis: a fundamentally humanistic ideology of Communism produced one of the most murderous regimes of the century; an international movement became increasingly chauvinistic and nationalistic; a full-blown welfare state also oppressed its population in unprecedented ways. Theories of Symbolic Exchange RUSSN-UA 860 Offered periodically. 4 points. In his seminal essay \u2018On the Gift\u201d (1923) Marcel Mauss developed a concept of an alternative, non-market type of economy. This economy is based on a non-monetary exchange of such symbolic values as social recognition, sovereignty and political participation. Today, this concept of the non-monetary exchange has acquired a new relevance \u2013 especially, in relationship to the economy of the Internet. This course examines various theories of the symbolic that expand the original Maussian model and encompass multiple aspects of culture: from Georges Bataille, Roger Caillois and Mikhail Bakhtin to Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard. Russia and the West RUSSN-UA 861 Offered every spring. 4 points. There are few problems as enduring and central to Russian history as the question of the West \u2013 Russia\u2019s most passionate romance and most bitter letdown. In this seminar we will read and think about Russian culture from the 17th to the 20th centuries through the lens of this obsession. The course will focus on the transfer of ideas and migrant communities. We will study the intellectual products of Russian interactions with the West \u2013 constitutional projects, scientific and economic thought, the Westernizer-Slavophile controversy, and revolutions. Substantial emphasis will be placed on the role of reading and translation in the making of cultural models: Russian Byronism, Russian Hamletism. More than ideas, the West came embodied in real people. We will consider the presence of European communities in Russia: German and British migrants who filled important niches in state service, trade, and scholarship; Italian sculptors and architects who designed some of Russia\u2019s most famous and symbolically potent monuments; Parisian aristocratic expatriates in the wake of the French Revolution; Communist workers and intellectuals, refugees from Nazi Germany; and foreign journalists who, in the late Soviet decades, trafficked illicit ideas, texts, and artworks. In the end, we will follow Russians into successive waves of emigration to Europe and the United States. Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace RUSSN-UA 862 Offered every three years. 4 points. This seminar is devoted to Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace. Our first priority will be a careful reading of Tolstoy\u2019s massive novel (if it is in fact a \u201cnovel\u201d: this is one of the questions we will address), with the goal of understanding how the text works and the techniques it uses in order to make possible the immersive pleasures it offers to readers. We will also consider the book\u2019s historical context; the sources that Tolstoy drew on; its place in Tolstoy\u2019s oeuvre and thought; its place in the Russian tradition and in \u201cworld\u201d literature; and the various uses (including political and ideological) that have been made of it since its initial publication. The Unquiet Dead: Imagining the Afterlife in Film and Fiction RUSSN-UA 870 Offered every other year. 4 points. Explores the connections between narrative and imagined scenarios for the afterlife. As we examine the literary and cinematic treatments of vampires, ghosts, zombies, and, in particular, posthumous narrators, we will look at the political and ideological deployment of afterlife narratives, investigating questions of cultural and sexual purity, collective guilt, and socioeconomic anxiety. Particular attention is paid to the folklore and fiction of the Slavic world, as well as to contemporary American reinterpretations. Readings will include texts by Nabokov, Gogol, Ovid, Stoker, and Morrison, accompanied by selected films. Internship and Independent Study Courses Open only to students majoring in the department. Internship RUSSN-UA 980 1 to 6 points per term. Native speakers of Russian may obtain internship credit by working with Russian language students and assisting language instructors. See the director of undergraduate studies for further details.

Before registering, students must submit a one-page typed description of the proposed project to the director of undergraduate studies and the proposed faculty sponsor.

Particular attention is paid to how categories  such as \"slave,\" \"peasant,\" \"white,\" and \"black\" have changed over time and to  how unfree people worked to turn what were perceived as cultural lacks into  aesthetic advantages.          20th-Century  Russia: Terror, Survival, and Beautiful Dreams    RUSSN-UA  859 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    Encompasses  the last years of the tsars and the Russian Revolution and utilizes such  diverse media as film, literature, visual art, and music. Topics include: Lenin  and communism; Stalinism; the Second World War; the end of Communism and the  transition to capitalism.

Theories  of Symbolic Exchange    RUSSN-UA  860 Offered  periodically. 4 points.    In  his seminal essay \"On the Gift\" (1923) Marcel Mauss developed a concept of an  alternative, non-market type of economy, based on a non-monetary exchange of  such symbolic values as social recognition, sovereignty, and political  participation. Today, this concept has acquired a new relevance in relation to the  economy of the Internet.
