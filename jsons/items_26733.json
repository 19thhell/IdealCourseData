SSAW is conducted at Stonestreet's 6,000 sq. ft. film, television and internet studio, where professional directors, producers, and casting directors develop and produce movies, pilots, commercials, television and webseries. Students train and work in the same environment with access to full production and post-production facilities (including several editing systems and editors) with the guidance of constructive teachers who are industry professionals. The emphasis of the workshop is on becoming imaginative and creative actors who are both believable and interesting cinematically in any genre while embracing a wide variety of characters and material from different periods and cultures.    While screen acting can utilize many of the same techniques and tools of theater acting, there are significant differences with regard to subtext, how the current technology can be used in creative and non-limiting ways, as well as with creating organic and compelling characters that often appear in a medium or long shot but also under the magnifying glass of the close-up. Ultimately students are guided from audition to rehearsal to performance with the hopes of inspiring with ideas and stories that are meaningful to both the actor and the audience.

The study, conducted by a nursing-dental research team at NYU, is the first of its kind to determine the proportion of Americans who are seen annually by a dentist but not by a general healthcare provider.   This finding suggests dentists can play a crucial role as health care practitioners in the front-line defense of identifying systemic disease which would otherwise go undetected in a significant portion of the population, say the researchers.   \"For these and other individuals, dental professionals are in a key position to assess and detect oral signs and symptoms of systemic health disorders that may otherwise go unnoticed, and to refer patients for follow-up care,\" said Dr. Shiela Strauss , an associate professor of nursing at the NYU College of Nursing and co-director of the statistics and data management core for NYU\u2019s Colleges of Nursing and Dentistry.   During the course of a routine dental examination, dentists and dental hygienists, as trained healthcare providers, can take a patient\u2019s health history, check blood pressure, and use direct clinical observation and X-rays to detect risk for systemic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.   The NYU research team examined the most recent available data, which came from a nationally representative subsample of 31,262 adults and children who participated in the Department of Health &amp; Human Services 2008 annual National Health Interview Survey, a health status study of the U.S. population, which at that time consisted of 304,375,942 individuals. Physicians, nurses, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants were among those categorized as general health care providers for the purposes of the survey.   When extrapolated to the U.S. population, 26 percent of children did not see a general health care provider. Yet over one-third of this group, representing nearly seven million children, did visit a dentist at least once during that year, according to survey results.   Among the adults, one quarter did not visit a general healthcare provider, yet almost a quarter -- nearly 13 million Americans -- did have at least one dental visit. When combined, adults and children who had contact only with dentists represent nearly 20 million people.   Ninety-three percent of the children and 85 percent of the adults had some form of health insurance, suggesting that while many of those who did not interact with a general healthcare provider may have had access to general health care, they opted not to seek it.   Coauthors on the study included Dr. Michael C. Alfano, executive vice president of New York University and former dean of the NYU College of Dentistry; Dr. Donna Shelley, clinical associate professor of cariology and comprehensive care at the NYU College of Dentistry and clinical associate professor of medicine and associate director of research at the NYU Langone Medical Center Division of General Internal Medicine; and Dr. Terry Fulmer, dean of the Northeastern University Bouv\u00e9 College of Health Sciences, and former professor and dean of the NYU College of Nursing.

Among the adults, one quarter did not visit a general healthcare provider, yet almost a quarter -- nearly 13 million Americans -- did have at least one dental visit. When combined, adults and children who had contact only with dentists represent nearly 20 million people.   Ninety-three percent of the children and 85 percent of the adults had some form of health insurance, suggesting that while many of those who did not interact with a general healthcare provider may have had access to general health care, they opted not to seek it.   Coauthors on the study included Dr. Michael C. Alfano, executive vice president of New York University and former dean of the NYU College of Dentistry; Dr. Donna Shelley, clinical associate professor of cariology and comprehensive care at the NYU College of Dentistry and clinical associate professor of medicine and associate director of research at the NYU Langone Medical Center Division of General Internal Medicine; and Dr. Terry Fulmer, dean of the Northeastern University Bouv\u00e9 College of Health Sciences, and former professor and dean of the NYU College of Nursing.

MCC-UE 1002 - Space and Place in Human Communication   This course will build on a core concept of Lewis Mumford who understood media ecology as a component of spatial and urban ecology. Emphasis will be given on how space socially organizes human meaning and on the inscription of space. How do people, through their practices and their being in the world, form relationships with the locales they occupy (both the natural world and the build environment)? How do they attach meaning to spaces to create places? And how do the experiences of inhabiting, viewing, and hearing those places shape their meanings, communicative practices, cultural performances, memories, and habits? Course themes include: mapping and the imagination; vision and space, soundscape, architecture and landscape, new media and space/time compression; space and identity; spatial violence; spatialization of memory.

Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1030 - Architecture as Media: Communication Through the Built Environment   This class reads architecture and the built environment through the lenses of media, communication, and culture. The course takes seriously the proposition that spaces communicate meaningfully and that learning to read spatial productions leads to better understanding how material and technological designs are in sustained conversation with the social, over time. Through analyses of a range of spaces from Gothic Cathedrals to suburban shopping malls to homes, factories, skyscrapers and digital cities students will acquire a vocabulary for relating representations and practices, symbols and structures, and for identifying the ideological and aesthetic positions that produce settings for everyday life.

View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1346 - Fame   Fame, notoriety, renown &ndash; the desire to be recognized and immortalized is the most enduring and perhaps the most desirable form of power. Culture, commerce, politics, and religion all proffer promises of fame &ndash; whether for fifteen minutes or fifteen centuries. This course departs from the insight that fame is a uniquely human ambition and a central force for social life. Together, we will investigate this subject by asking, what is fame?, Why do people want it?, How do they get it?, What can they do with it?, How does it affect those around them, and the generations that come after? In other words, what kind of good is fame? Drawing on texts from history, ethnography, theory, literature, philosophy, and contemporary media, this course will reflect on the ethics, erotics, pragmatics and pathologies of fame. We will compare fame to other forms of recognition (reputation, honor, etc.), and look at how fame operates in various social and historical circumstances, from small agricultural communities to enormous, hyper-mediated societies such as our own. Is fame, in our contemporary understanding, possible before photography? We&rsquo;ll consider the enduring question of fame as it is transformed by the technological conditions of reproducing reputation across space, time, and societies.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1347 - Culture of the Screen: From the Cinematic to the Handheld   Whether large, small, wide, high-definition, public, personal, shared, or handheld, screens are one of the most pervasive technologies in everyday life. From spaces of work to spaces of leisure, screens are sites for collaboration, performance, surveillance, and resistance. This course traces the cultural history of screens through a range of forms -- from the panorama to the cinema, from the radar system to the television, and from the terminal to the mobile device -- to provide a way of thinking about the development of the screen as simultaneously architectural, material, representational and computational. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1351 - War As Media   This course examines the proposition that contemporary war should be understood as media. War has become mediatized and media has been militarized. This course treats war and poltical violence as communicative acts and technologies and focuses on how they shape our understanding and experience of landscape, vision, body, time and memory.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1352 - Empire, Revolution and Media   This course examines the role of media in the history and emergence of empires and revolutions and the history of media empires. It focuses on the investment in media forces by both empires and revolutions, and the tendency of media to form empires that are subject to periodic revolution? in the marketplace within the contexts of colonization, decolonization and globalization. Media discussed include prints, paintings, photography, journalism, fiction, cinema, the Internet and digital media. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1403 - Postcolonial Visual Culture   This courses addresses how colonialism and postcolonialism are shaped and mediated through images and the gaze. The dynamics of colonial history motivate and shape colonial and postcolonial perceptions and influence their patterns of global circulation when the boundary between the world out there and the nation at home is increasingly blurred. We will survey a range of image texts through various media (photography, television, cinema) and sites (war, the harem, refugee camps, prisons, disasters): nationalist mobilization, counter-insurgency, urban conflict, disaster management, the prison system, and the war on terror. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1409 - Consumption, Culture, and Identity   This course offers students the opportunity to engage with theories of communication and culture through the context of consumption and contemporary consumer society.

We will give particular attention to consumption's role in the construction of social and cultural identities. Students will consider critical responses to consumer culture, including the resistance and refusal of consumption as well as the attempted mobilization of consumption toward social change.    View Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1410 - Global Visual Culture   This course examines the role of visual culture in the emergence of, concepts of, and processes of globalization and the global cultural flows. In introducing students to the concept of the visual construction of the social field, the course compares the means by which cultures visualize themselves in forms ranging from the imagination to the encounter between people and visualized media. The course takes as its fundamental premise that visual culture circulates and creates meaning in increasing global flows and that the very foundations of global capital, global culture, and global media are based on the dynamics of visuality and the power systems it both affirms and challenges. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1411 - Visual Culture of Science and Technology   This course examines the imagery of science and technology, the role of visuality in the construction of scientific knowledge, artistic renditions of science, and the emergence of visual technologies in modern society. It looks at how visuality has been key to the exercise of power through such practices as cataloguing and identification; the designation of abnormality, disease, and pathologies; medical diagnosis; scientific experimentation; and the marketing of science and medicine. We will examine the development of the visual technologies in the emerging scientific practices of psychiatry and criminology; explore the sciences of eugenics, genetics, pharmacology, brain and body scans, and digital medical images of many kinds; the marketing of pharmaceuticals, and the emerging politics of scientific activism. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 1412 - Introduction to Visual Culture   Visual images pervade our everyday lives. We negotiate the world through visual culture, and the world itself is negotiated politically through visuality and visual images. This class is an introduction to the key issues of visual culture. It will examine the politics of images, the role that images play in producing cultural meaning, visuality and power relations, and how images are forms of visual communication. We will examine how images circulate through digital media, remakes, and viral networks, and the cross-fertilization of images between various social arenas, such as art, advertising, popular culture, news, science, entertainment media, video games, theme parks, and design.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1508 - Print, Typography and Form   This course surveys a number of important themes in Western history and thought by way of our most omnipresent medium: typography. Organized around three major technological innovations&mdash;the printing press in the mid-15th century, multi-cylinder and sheet-fed rotary presses in the second half of the 19th century, and the desktop computer in the late 20th century&mdash;this course will look at the sociopolitically transformative power of print. Topics of study may include print&rsquo;s relation to: religion and science, censorship and ownership of the press, money, advertising in the public sphere, gender politics, Nationalism, Socialism, late-20th century countercultures, as well as more contemporary concerns that arise from the transition of print to digital and online platforms. In this course we will discover that whether dealing with marketing, journalism, political activism, design, or new media, typography is a fundamental concern.    Sample Syllabus          MCC-UE 1517 - Photography and the Visual Archive   This course examines the role and history of photography within the historical landscape of media and communication. Special emphasis is placed on the accumulative meaning of visual archives, tracing how images relation and establish cultural territories across a variety of texts and media. The course investigates and contrasts the mimetic visual strategies within western and non-western traditions, looking at historical and contemporary images in a variety of forms. View sample syllabus          MCC-UE 9015 / MCC-UE 1015 - Advertising and Society (Prague)   The course examines the role of advertising not only as an economic force but also as a form of cultural representation with a focus on the social implications of the role of consumerism in contemporary society by following its various forms around the world.
