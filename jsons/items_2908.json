N. P.-of Jamaica, 1965)  By Bertell Ollman    Is this true? Listen to the words of Jesus and decide for yourselves whether Socialism is Practical Christianity.     SOCIALISM MEANS BROTHERHOOD:    \"all ye are brethren.\" (Matthew\"23;8)    \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"(Matthew: 22; 39)    \"All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" (Matthew: 7; 12)    \"Let everyone who possesses two shirts share with him who has none, and let him who has food do likewise.\" (Luke: 3; 11)    \"Give to every man that asketh of thee.\" (Luke: 6; 30)      SOCIALISM MEANS JUSTICE:    \"Give and it shall be given unto you...for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.\" (Luke: 6; 38)     SOCIALISM MEANS BEING FOR POOR PEOPLE AND AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSORS:    \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...to preach deliverance to the captives.\" (Luke: 4; 18)     SOCIALISM MEANS OPPOSITION TO THE GREEDY RICH:    \"Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation.\"(Luke: 6; 24).    \"No man can serve two mastersYe cannot serve God and mammon.\" (Matthew: 6; 24)    \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\"(Matthew: 19; 23)     SOCIALISM MEANS CHRISTIAN CONCERN FOR SOCIAL PROBLEMS:    Jesus' life, as well as his teachings, was a model of concern for his fellow human beings. Though poor in material things, he and his disciples shared what they had with all about them. For centuries afterwards, those who called themselves Christians were most noteworthy for the cooperative fellowship that characterized the community in which Jesus lived. For these men, Christianity was a matter of making over their lives to bring the greatest good to mankind. So, too, for many of the early Christian missionaries who came to Jamaica. It was Churchmen like Knibb, Burchell and Sharpe who fought the planters and got slavery abolished. Land settlement to provide land for the freed slaves and public education for the children of the poor also came about through the efforts of these true Christians. George Williams Gordon and Bogle of St. Thomas were Churchmen who were willing to suffer martyrdom to improve the conditions of the people.    SOCIALISM MEANS THE SOLUTION:   Then, as now, it was not possible to love God without loving one's fellow man, and putting this love into practice. In the modern period, unemployment and its accompanying ills have replaced slavery as the principal evil. Today in Jamaica no true Christian can remain indifferent while hundreds of thousands of his countrymen are ill-fed, badly housed, illiterate, and without proper medical care. Pained by the sight of so much suffering, many high minded Christians have turned to socialism as the solution.    SOCIALISM MEANS AN END TO CAPITALIST INJUSTICE:    Capitalism, the system under which we are now living, may be described as a way of life in which, \"One soweth, and another reapeth\"(John: 4; 37). Well might we say to the wealthy few who own our large estates and factories what Jesus said to his disciples: \"youreap that whereon ye bestowed no labor\"(John: 4; 38). The capitalists cease from resting only to eat, while you cease from working only to rest, and eat only when you can. Do you believe that Jesus favored such injustice, he who said, \"by their fruits ye shall know them\"(Mathew: 7; 20)? The fruits of capitalism in Jamaica can be seen even by the blind; they are poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, crime, greed, and disease. Could the kind and loving Jesus have wanted us to live like this?    SOCIALISM MEANS LIVING THE GOLDEN RULE:    Socialism is the exact opposite of capitalism. In socialism, every man carries an equal burden of work and shares equally in the good things that society has to offer. There is no poverty, because all the idle land and machines have been put to use to produce the things people want. Production is aimed at satisfying the needs of the masses rather than the profit interest of a few. There is no unemployment, because a plan has been created to put everyone to work. Illiteracy is soon abolished, and the diseases that plague people are reduced to the few for which advanced medicine has not found a cure. Each individual is given the chance of developing himself to the fullest, with everyone helping him in whatever way they can. The Golden Rule&#151;\"as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise\"(Luke: 6; 31)&#151;has become the rule which all men follow in their daily lives.    SOCIALISM MEANS THE PEOPLE OWN THEIR COUNTRY:    The journey to socialism is long and hard; but Jesus never said Christianity was easy. The road to socialism passes by way of public ownership of large estates and factories, that is the replacement of private capitalists by the workers, the consumers, the local community, or the national Government. In this way people will own their places of work, either directly or through some body duly elected to represent them. If a man works on his own as a farmer or craftsman, he will continue to do so or become a member of a local cooperative. The choice is his, and, no matter what he chooses, socialism will bring him outstanding benefits in the way of a fair price for his products, security during ill health and old age, greatly improved educational, medical, recreational, and cultural facilities, and much else. Those who work for large firms and estates, on the other hand, will become the common owners of their enterprises. Throughout, cooperation, the brotherhood called for in Christ's teachings, is at the center of socialism, and it will be encouraged in all walks of life and by every possible means.    SOCIALISM DOES NOT MEAN WHAT ITS ENEMIES SAYS IT DOES:    There are a few rich people in Jamaica who hate socialism, because it would take away their special privileges and make them our equals. These selfish men, who own the press and the radio, try to scare people by telling them lies about socialism. These are the \"false prophets\" of our day. Jesus, too, had put up with many lies told by those who disliked his teachings. Here are some of the worst lies you are likely to hear about socialism. Don't you be fooled.    It is a LIE that socialism is against Christianity. How can it be when socialism is Christianity put into practice? It is a LIE that people cannot worship freely in socialism. It is a LIE that socialism means cutting your goat or house in two and giving half to the government. It is a LIE that socialism means that the small farmer will have his land taken away from him. It is a LIE that socialism will make us all prisoners of the Russians or the Chinese or the Cubans. What nonsense, yet our capitalists are counting on you to believe it.    SOCIALISM IS COMING&#151;WITH YOUR HELP:    If, indeed, SOCIALISM IS PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY, it is the duty of every Christian to help bring it about as quickly as possible. Keep in mind&#151;all that is needed to win a victory for EQUALITY and BROTHERHOOD is for enough of you, the people of Jamaica, to want it and to will it. In politics, as in religious matters, we have much to learn from Jesus' words:     \"Ask, and it shall be given to you;   seek, and ye shall find; knock, and   it shall be opened to you\"(Mathew: 7; 7).   Your children are depending on you. Don't fail them.

Sanger    [ March 26, 1911 ]     In this day and age, when women are striving to their utmost to compete with their sisters in matters of dress, fashion, in  \"bridge,\" or anything which offers amusement or diversion from the old routine of our mothers' day, we hear a great deal from  the male element about \"Woman's Duty.\" This question of \"duty\" seems to be a stickler, and seems to confine itself to woman   only.      This \"duty,\" so called, means that women should remain at home, not necessarily to drudge -- not at all -- for among those  women referred to above, the servant question forms a large part of their conversation; but \"duty\" means the care of the home,  of the children -- the problem of feeding them carefully (even scientifically), of making their little bodies strong and robust, in  fact, of giving them a good foundation mentally and physically -- for life.        Most men think a woman's duty is done when she attends to these needs of her children, but to me she has but begun to do her  duty.      Let us take a young woman in the most ideal conditions of this life; she has given much thought and consideration to the life of  her boy long before he was born, her every thought for almost a year was this child. He now comes into the world a rosy,  healthy being, and she feels proud her work is so well begun; and she may well be proud.      Then follow the years of care. Every conceivable attention, mental and moral, she gives him; his childhood, his boyhood, is one  joyous song of the pleasures of living, and after years of these joys he emerges into manhood. He is now ready for the great  battle of life.      This mother has done her duty, and she sends him forth, clean, honest, moral, to get his living, but has she ever given the manner  in which he is to obtain that living a thought? That is considered outside woman's \"duty.\"      We women can build them up, these bodies and minds, build them up to our highest expectations and then push them out upon  a world whose system is greed, exploitation, graft and scientific robbery.      Can we expect these morals to stay built up in these corrupt surroundings? As this case is an ideal one, so it is an exceptional  one; let us turn, then, to one which is no exception.      This is the case of the most abused, most dejected, most imposed upon class of mothers which our social system presents to us,  and their number is legion.      Here we find the little mothers at 8, 9 and 10 years of age; here we see them already at work carrying responsibilities of the  home, factory or mill; education is a thing apart from this child, childhood yearnings are crushed, childish joys are barred here,  there is time for but one thing -- work. Work through childhood, through girlhood and womanhood.      We follow this child-mother up to the marriage day and find she has given her childhood, girlhood, womanhood, her strength,  her very life to the factory or mill for an existence, an existence which the owner of the factory would not allow his horse or dog.  Her face is pale and pinched with that hunting look of poverty; it never changes -- she is born, lives and dies with that look. She  is married at night after the day's work, that she lose not one day's time.      On, on in the same monotonous way; on, on, waiting for the end.      There's no time for her to think of the little one's coming; she must work only the harder because of its coming.      After months of worry, toil, privation and physical exhaustion this child, too, is born. Let us see what this woman gives to  society. Her child is undersized, underfed, weak, sickly and ofttimes deformed. It, too, has paid the price of birth;  it has given its little strength with every heartbeat, that it may be born, and now it is here, cheated and swindled of its birthright.      Women, women, arouse yourselves! If you are not so unfortunately placed, it is but a trick of circumstances.      If you are well clothed, well fed, today it is these women who have helped you to do so. And are you doing anything for these  women? Ministers of the Gospel, what are you doing for these women and unborn babies? You reformers, conservatives, call  yourselves what you wish, what are you doing for this condition of society which demands of its unborn such an awful price of  birth? Do you think your duty is done if you have clothed or fed one or fifty of these victims for a day, a week, a year, perhaps?  Oh, mothers, sisters, women of this land, awake! How can you slumber when these conditions exist?      The day is passed when we can selfishly protect our own. In order to protect our own, in matters of disease, in conditions  where milk, water, food or drugs are unsafe for our own loved ones, we cannot hesitate to fight for all, for we realize we can  only save our own by so doing.      Again I say: Women, awake, awake to this system and help these downtrodden women back to their homes, back to their little  ones, back to that which belongs to every mother -- the care and love of her offspring.      By the way, do we ever hear the male element, who so strongly advocate \"home duty\" for the \"bridge\" mother, advocate home  duty for these women? It is only the \"bridge\" women's children who need the care and attention of the mother, evidently.      Let us turn to the mother we have just beheld with her new-born infant. What is to be done with this subnormal piece of  humanity? Does it not need even more care and attention than a normal child? But what does it get? Dire poverty drives this  mother back again to the factory (no intelligent person will say she goes willingly). It is the fear of the loss of a job, debts and  another mouth to feed that compels her to leave this newborn infant in the care of any one who has the room to keep it. Any  friend or neighbor who works at home can take care of this little waif.      We all know the type -- hard working, ignorant, with scarcely time to attend to the actual needs of her own.      The little one is placed here among the filth and debris of the workshop. It grows through babyhood and childhood motherless,  fatherless and moral-less.      Of course, there are other alternatives, such as the charity kindergartens, but always the mother on the industrial field is cheated  of love and care of her offspring.      In this age of Christianity, in this advanced twentieth century, when science has discovered the methods of breeding the finest  horses and dogs, when science has turned its searchlight upon every form of plant life; upon the  different parasites which tend to destroy plant life, what has it done toward extricating the parasite poverty, which destroys humanity? Senator Owen, of  Oklahoma, said recently:      \"We spend $500,000 to exterminate the insect that eats the cotton plant. . . . We have millions for conservation of the forests.  Our Senators and Representatives jump to their feet the minute one mentions raising the tariff on wool or on steel, but we can  get no such interest when it comes to saving human lives.\"      Look at the health report for the past three years and see the loss of children in New York City alone:               Year    Under one year.    Under two years.    Under five years.          1908    16,231    20,462    24,141          1909    15,976    20,716    24,519          1910    16,213    20,560    24,266               Or 48,420 little infants under one year of age and 72,926 children under five, all in three years. What a shameful slaughter!  What a cowardly and selfish people to allow these modern Herods, Poverty and Ignorance, deliberately and silently to do away  with this army of innocent and helpless babies!      Why should these countless fathers and mothers, almost one million times greater in number, surrender to these few monster  exploiters -- to this Capitalistic System which bases its existence on the fiendish exploitation, and ultimate murder of these  children?      We do not wonder such a small percentage of these children attain the age of puberty. Yet the manufacturer knows that his  material must be well made, strong and firm; he knows the stronger and firmer it is woven, the better it will stand the wear and  tear. Again, the tailor knows it takes time and care to make of this material a nicely shaped dress or coat, and if used before it's  ready it will not be so serviceable.      If man would do his duty to Human Beings, as well as he does to Things, we  [ would ] have no need of leaving the little ones to the care of strangers all day. We would have no need of giving our babies' lives to the factory before they are born. We would  have no need of seeing our little ones grow up in mental, moral, and physical starvation. We would have no need of suffering the  awful pangs, of seeing them go out of the world, so soon, pangs which are so much keener than those which bring them here.  All these and a thousand other sufferings and evils could be stamped out if man would do his duty.      There are two steps toward progress in this universe -- organization and specialization. Mothers, let us not consider we are  progressing. Let us not consider we have done our duty, until we have first organized. Then let us specialize in attacking and  stamping out this social system.      We must organize -- all women who have one vestige of love in our hearts, for children; all women who have interest in the  progress of humanity; all should organize, but not alone.      We should organize under a banner which advocates our cause. We should join the party (there is but one, the Socialist party)  which solves the problems of each and every grievance of these working women and children.      First, we should demand through this party absolute equality of the sexes.      Second, to put back the mothers or the prospective mothers, into the homes, and give her a pension sufficient to keep herself  and child. I can hear wails of protest concerning this last demand, on the ground that it will make vagrants of the fathers or will  give them more time and money for saloons. All I can ask is that you look into this, find out what has been done, and the results  you will find will remove that argument completely.

N. P.-of Jamaica, 1965)  By Bertell Ollman    Is this true? Listen to the words of Jesus and decide for yourselves whether Socialism is Practical Christianity.     SOCIALISM MEANS BROTHERHOOD:    \"all ye are brethren.\" (Matthew\"23;8)    \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\"(Matthew: 22; 39)    \"All things whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\" (Matthew: 7; 12)    \"Let everyone who possesses two shirts share with him who has none, and let him who has food do likewise.\" (Luke: 3; 11)    \"Give to every man that asketh of thee.\" (Luke: 6; 30)      SOCIALISM MEANS JUSTICE:    \"Give and it shall be given unto you...for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.\" (Luke: 6; 38)     SOCIALISM MEANS BEING FOR POOR PEOPLE AND AGAINST THEIR OPPRESSORS:    \"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor...to preach deliverance to the captives.\" (Luke: 4; 18)     SOCIALISM MEANS OPPOSITION TO THE GREEDY RICH:    \"Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation.\"(Luke: 6; 24).    \"No man can serve two mastersYe cannot serve God and mammon.\" (Matthew: 6; 24)    \"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.\"(Matthew: 19; 23)     SOCIALISM MEANS CHRISTIAN CONCERN FOR SOCIAL PROBLEMS:    Jesus' life, as well as his teachings, was a model of concern for his fellow human beings. Though poor in material things, he and his disciples shared what they had with all about them. For centuries afterwards, those who called themselves Christians were most noteworthy for the cooperative fellowship that characterized the community in which Jesus lived. For these men, Christianity was a matter of making over their lives to bring the greatest good to mankind. So, too, for many of the early Christian missionaries who came to Jamaica. It was Churchmen like Knibb, Burchell and Sharpe who fought the planters and got slavery abolished. Land settlement to provide land for the freed slaves and public education for the children of the poor also came about through the efforts of these true Christians. George Williams Gordon and Bogle of St. Thomas were Churchmen who were willing to suffer martyrdom to improve the conditions of the people.    SOCIALISM MEANS THE SOLUTION:   Then, as now, it was not possible to love God without loving one's fellow man, and putting this love into practice. In the modern period, unemployment and its accompanying ills have replaced slavery as the principal evil. Today in Jamaica no true Christian can remain indifferent while hundreds of thousands of his countrymen are ill-fed, badly housed, illiterate, and without proper medical care. Pained by the sight of so much suffering, many high minded Christians have turned to socialism as the solution.    SOCIALISM MEANS AN END TO CAPITALIST INJUSTICE:    Capitalism, the system under which we are now living, may be described as a way of life in which, \"One soweth, and another reapeth\"(John: 4; 37). Well might we say to the wealthy few who own our large estates and factories what Jesus said to his disciples: \"youreap that whereon ye bestowed no labor\"(John: 4; 38). The capitalists cease from resting only to eat, while you cease from working only to rest, and eat only when you can. Do you believe that Jesus favored such injustice, he who said, \"by their fruits ye shall know them\"(Mathew: 7; 20)? The fruits of capitalism in Jamaica can be seen even by the blind; they are poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, crime, greed, and disease. Could the kind and loving Jesus have wanted us to live like this?    SOCIALISM MEANS LIVING THE GOLDEN RULE:    Socialism is the exact opposite of capitalism. In socialism, every man carries an equal burden of work and shares equally in the good things that society has to offer. There is no poverty, because all the idle land and machines have been put to use to produce the things people want. Production is aimed at satisfying the needs of the masses rather than the profit interest of a few. There is no unemployment, because a plan has been created to put everyone to work. Illiteracy is soon abolished, and the diseases that plague people are reduced to the few for which advanced medicine has not found a cure. Each individual is given the chance of developing himself to the fullest, with everyone helping him in whatever way they can. The Golden Rule&#151;\"as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise\"(Luke: 6; 31)&#151;has become the rule which all men follow in their daily lives.    SOCIALISM MEANS THE PEOPLE OWN THEIR COUNTRY:    The journey to socialism is long and hard; but Jesus never said Christianity was easy. The road to socialism passes by way of public ownership of large estates and factories, that is the replacement of private capitalists by the workers, the consumers, the local community, or the national Government. In this way people will own their places of work, either directly or through some body duly elected to represent them. If a man works on his own as a farmer or craftsman, he will continue to do so or become a member of a local cooperative. The choice is his, and, no matter what he chooses, socialism will bring him outstanding benefits in the way of a fair price for his products, security during ill health and old age, greatly improved educational, medical, recreational, and cultural facilities, and much else. Those who work for large firms and estates, on the other hand, will become the common owners of their enterprises. Throughout, cooperation, the brotherhood called for in Christ's teachings, is at the center of socialism, and it will be encouraged in all walks of life and by every possible means.    SOCIALISM DOES NOT MEAN WHAT ITS ENEMIES SAYS IT DOES:    There are a few rich people in Jamaica who hate socialism, because it would take away their special privileges and make them our equals. These selfish men, who own the press and the radio, try to scare people by telling them lies about socialism. These are the \"false prophets\" of our day. Jesus, too, had put up with many lies told by those who disliked his teachings. Here are some of the worst lies you are likely to hear about socialism. Don't you be fooled.    It is a LIE that socialism is against Christianity. How can it be when socialism is Christianity put into practice? It is a LIE that people cannot worship freely in socialism. It is a LIE that socialism means cutting your goat or house in two and giving half to the government. It is a LIE that socialism means that the small farmer will have his land taken away from him. It is a LIE that socialism will make us all prisoners of the Russians or the Chinese or the Cubans. What nonsense, yet our capitalists are counting on you to believe it.    SOCIALISM IS COMING&#151;WITH YOUR HELP:    If, indeed, SOCIALISM IS PRACTICAL CHRISTIANITY, it is the duty of every Christian to help bring it about as quickly as possible. Keep in mind&#151;all that is needed to win a victory for EQUALITY and BROTHERHOOD is for enough of you, the people of Jamaica, to want it and to will it. In politics, as in religious matters, we have much to learn from Jesus' words:     \"Ask, and it shall be given to you;   seek, and ye shall find; knock, and   it shall be opened to you\"(Mathew: 7; 7).   Your children are depending on you. Don't fail them.

Sanger    [ March 26, 1911 ]     In this day and age, when women are striving to their utmost to compete with their sisters in matters of dress, fashion, in  \"bridge,\" or anything which offers amusement or diversion from the old routine of our mothers' day, we hear a great deal from  the male element about \"Woman's Duty.\" This question of \"duty\" seems to be a stickler, and seems to confine itself to woman   only.      This \"duty,\" so called, means that women should remain at home, not necessarily to drudge -- not at all -- for among those  women referred to above, the servant question forms a large part of their conversation; but \"duty\" means the care of the home,  of the children -- the problem of feeding them carefully (even scientifically), of making their little bodies strong and robust, in  fact, of giving them a good foundation mentally and physically -- for life.        Most men think a woman's duty is done when she attends to these needs of her children, but to me she has but begun to do her  duty.      Let us take a young woman in the most ideal conditions of this life; she has given much thought and consideration to the life of  her boy long before he was born, her every thought for almost a year was this child. He now comes into the world a rosy,  healthy being, and she feels proud her work is so well begun; and she may well be proud.      Then follow the years of care. Every conceivable attention, mental and moral, she gives him; his childhood, his boyhood, is one  joyous song of the pleasures of living, and after years of these joys he emerges into manhood. He is now ready for the great  battle of life.      This mother has done her duty, and she sends him forth, clean, honest, moral, to get his living, but has she ever given the manner  in which he is to obtain that living a thought? That is considered outside woman's \"duty.\"      We women can build them up, these bodies and minds, build them up to our highest expectations and then push them out upon  a world whose system is greed, exploitation, graft and scientific robbery.      Can we expect these morals to stay built up in these corrupt surroundings? As this case is an ideal one, so it is an exceptional  one; let us turn, then, to one which is no exception.      This is the case of the most abused, most dejected, most imposed upon class of mothers which our social system presents to us,  and their number is legion.      Here we find the little mothers at 8, 9 and 10 years of age; here we see them already at work carrying responsibilities of the  home, factory or mill; education is a thing apart from this child, childhood yearnings are crushed, childish joys are barred here,  there is time for but one thing -- work. Work through childhood, through girlhood and womanhood.      We follow this child-mother up to the marriage day and find she has given her childhood, girlhood, womanhood, her strength,  her very life to the factory or mill for an existence, an existence which the owner of the factory would not allow his horse or dog.  Her face is pale and pinched with that hunting look of poverty; it never changes -- she is born, lives and dies with that look. She  is married at night after the day's work, that she lose not one day's time.      On, on in the same monotonous way; on, on, waiting for the end.      There's no time for her to think of the little one's coming; she must work only the harder because of its coming.      After months of worry, toil, privation and physical exhaustion this child, too, is born. Let us see what this woman gives to  society. Her child is undersized, underfed, weak, sickly and ofttimes deformed. It, too, has paid the price of birth;  it has given its little strength with every heartbeat, that it may be born, and now it is here, cheated and swindled of its birthright.      Women, women, arouse yourselves! If you are not so unfortunately placed, it is but a trick of circumstances.      If you are well clothed, well fed, today it is these women who have helped you to do so. And are you doing anything for these  women? Ministers of the Gospel, what are you doing for these women and unborn babies? You reformers, conservatives, call  yourselves what you wish, what are you doing for this condition of society which demands of its unborn such an awful price of  birth? Do you think your duty is done if you have clothed or fed one or fifty of these victims for a day, a week, a year, perhaps?  Oh, mothers, sisters, women of this land, awake! How can you slumber when these conditions exist?      The day is passed when we can selfishly protect our own. In order to protect our own, in matters of disease, in conditions  where milk, water, food or drugs are unsafe for our own loved ones, we cannot hesitate to fight for all, for we realize we can  only save our own by so doing.      Again I say: Women, awake, awake to this system and help these downtrodden women back to their homes, back to their little  ones, back to that which belongs to every mother -- the care and love of her offspring.      By the way, do we ever hear the male element, who so strongly advocate \"home duty\" for the \"bridge\" mother, advocate home  duty for these women? It is only the \"bridge\" women's children who need the care and attention of the mother, evidently.      Let us turn to the mother we have just beheld with her new-born infant. What is to be done with this subnormal piece of  humanity? Does it not need even more care and attention than a normal child? But what does it get? Dire poverty drives this  mother back again to the factory (no intelligent person will say she goes willingly). It is the fear of the loss of a job, debts and  another mouth to feed that compels her to leave this newborn infant in the care of any one who has the room to keep it. Any  friend or neighbor who works at home can take care of this little waif.      We all know the type -- hard working, ignorant, with scarcely time to attend to the actual needs of her own.      The little one is placed here among the filth and debris of the workshop. It grows through babyhood and childhood motherless,  fatherless and moral-less.      Of course, there are other alternatives, such as the charity kindergartens, but always the mother on the industrial field is cheated  of love and care of her offspring.      In this age of Christianity, in this advanced twentieth century, when science has discovered the methods of breeding the finest  horses and dogs, when science has turned its searchlight upon every form of plant life; upon the  different parasites which tend to destroy plant life, what has it done toward extricating the parasite poverty, which destroys humanity? Senator Owen, of  Oklahoma, said recently:      \"We spend $500,000 to exterminate the insect that eats the cotton plant. . . . We have millions for conservation of the forests.  Our Senators and Representatives jump to their feet the minute one mentions raising the tariff on wool or on steel, but we can  get no such interest when it comes to saving human lives.\"      Look at the health report for the past three years and see the loss of children in New York City alone:               Year    Under one year.    Under two years.    Under five years.          1908    16,231    20,462    24,141          1909    15,976    20,716    24,519          1910    16,213    20,560    24,266               Or 48,420 little infants under one year of age and 72,926 children under five, all in three years. What a shameful slaughter!  What a cowardly and selfish people to allow these modern Herods, Poverty and Ignorance, deliberately and silently to do away  with this army of innocent and helpless babies!      Why should these countless fathers and mothers, almost one million times greater in number, surrender to these few monster  exploiters -- to this Capitalistic System which bases its existence on the fiendish exploitation, and ultimate murder of these  children?      We do not wonder such a small percentage of these children attain the age of puberty. Yet the manufacturer knows that his  material must be well made, strong and firm; he knows the stronger and firmer it is woven, the better it will stand the wear and  tear. Again, the tailor knows it takes time and care to make of this material a nicely shaped dress or coat, and if used before it's  ready it will not be so serviceable.      If man would do his duty to Human Beings, as well as he does to Things, we  [ would ] have no need of leaving the little ones to the care of strangers all day. We would have no need of giving our babies' lives to the factory before they are born. We would  have no need of seeing our little ones grow up in mental, moral, and physical starvation. We would have no need of suffering the  awful pangs, of seeing them go out of the world, so soon, pangs which are so much keener than those which bring them here.  All these and a thousand other sufferings and evils could be stamped out if man would do his duty.      There are two steps toward progress in this universe -- organization and specialization. Mothers, let us not consider we are  progressing. Let us not consider we have done our duty, until we have first organized. Then let us specialize in attacking and  stamping out this social system.      We must organize -- all women who have one vestige of love in our hearts, for children; all women who have interest in the  progress of humanity; all should organize, but not alone.      We should organize under a banner which advocates our cause. We should join the party (there is but one, the Socialist party)  which solves the problems of each and every grievance of these working women and children.      First, we should demand through this party absolute equality of the sexes.      Second, to put back the mothers or the prospective mothers, into the homes, and give her a pension sufficient to keep herself  and child. I can hear wails of protest concerning this last demand, on the ground that it will make vagrants of the fathers or will  give them more time and money for saloons. All I can ask is that you look into this, find out what has been done, and the results  you will find will remove that argument completely. It has been the experience of those interested in this, that when a man feels  his burdens partly lifted, he is mentally and physically better fitted for life's work.      Third, to support and educate the children, and by support we mean clearly to feed and clothe them, until they are at least 16  years of age.      Fourth, to keep every child, regardless of race, color, or creed, in this United States out of all factories, mills and all industrial  fields which tend to dwarf the physical or mental development of the children.      Last, to pull down completely this system, which mangles and stunts the minds, morals and bodies of our boys and men; to fight  this awful viper, which undoes all our life's work, to crush and stamp it out forever. This, mothers, is a duty which must go hand  in hand with our every day duties, or our life's work will be all for nothing.
