One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which  gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually  stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished  professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from  NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional,  cultural, and governmental leaders. In spring 2005, the College  of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which  extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors  Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small  classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the  wider New York community. In some instances students may count the  classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this  appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives. Advanced  Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact  with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to  challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis  and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct  their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an  environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students  and faculty alike. \u2014Dean Matthew S. Santirocco Course Descriptions    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72828) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of  the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court\u2019s  interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely  affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of  government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation  of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \u201cImperial  Judiciary.\u201d Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted  properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the  face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them,  and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the  Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines  current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis  and the Court\u2019s participation in the debate. Topics include abortion,  euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights,  gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; college  speech codes, including \u201chate\u201d speech and symbolic speech; and racial  and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court  cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the  political spectrum. Students are expected to apply critical thinking to  the topics. Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq.,   is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp;  Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School  of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree  from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and  taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of  Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepci\u00f3n  (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He  has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on  legal topics and is recognized in the International Who\u2019s Who\u2014Lawyers .  Mr. Pomerantz has participated in important and controversial matters  affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of  public artistic expression, right of privacy for acts of consenting  adults, and numerous free speech cases. The United States and the War on Terror: Terrorism, Counterterrorism, and National Security (V28.0122; call # 75545) Instructor: Karen J. Greenberg Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. In  the aftermath of 9/11, the United States launched a \u201cwar on terror\u201d and  in so doing challenged some of the basic assumptions of American  domestic and international policy. In the name of security, the powers  of the presidency, the nature of the courts, the role of the media, and  the limits of internationalism have come under scrutiny. This seminar  explores the questions that have come to the fore in the war on terror  and seeks to place them in historical context. The course will address,  among other topics, the balance between security and liberty,  Guantanamo Bay, detention and the roles of the Office of the Vice  President, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of  State, and the effectiveness of the United States as a partner in the  global war on terror. The course considers the changes that may be  required by a 21st century in which the emergence of security as a  vital concern has come to dominate questions of policy and philosophy. Karen J. Greenberg, Executive Director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law, is the editor of the NYU Review of Law and Security . She co-edited The Enemy Combatant Papers: American Justice, the Courts, and the War on Terror; The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib ; and is the editor of Al Qaeda Now and The Torture Debate in America . She is a frequent contributor on security issues for national publications. Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 72832) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  course explores the instability of the European state system in the  pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining  the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak  of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and  the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various  diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in  the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various  interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan  crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German  naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal  responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict,  and the attempts to contain it. May be counted toward the major in History.  Stewart A. Stehlin   is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the  development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th  centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic  history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on  European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history,  especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866\u20131890, a translation of Friedrich Ratzel\u2019s Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919\u20131933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870\u20131919 . Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75298) Instructor: Michael A. Westerman Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. There  are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between  individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The  seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these  unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a  long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about  centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence\u2014what  place do our relationships with other people have in our lives?  Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic  interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones.  Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas  where these tensions appear, including models of child development,  approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy.  We also consider more \u201cinterpersonal\u201d versus more individual-centered  ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction  itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences.  We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers  suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of  psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout  the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions  by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which  contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person  from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar. Michael A. Westerman   is Associate Professor of Psychology. He also holds a Consulting  Faculty appointment in the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral  Sciences at Beth Israel Medical Center. His area of expertise is  clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics  concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of  mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist  relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles  on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a  program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of  psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of  interpersonal defense. Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 72834) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and  thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion  today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal,  medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and  gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed,  sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at  the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary  literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for  civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz   is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative  Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and  culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for  several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about  abortion, entitled \u201cVoices,\u201d in New York and Washington, D.C. \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited (V28.0144; call # 72836) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This  seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering  approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological  rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d  is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a  wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different  stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the  phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism,  totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or  distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill  the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal,  and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their  credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political  religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them  with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in  which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious  expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the  modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The  seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which  the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality  will need to occur. James Gilligan ,  Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and  directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system  while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of  Psychiatry.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 72839) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all  too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black  Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time  of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in  the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman  Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious  authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era,  there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms,  vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense  consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through  the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the  beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of  Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and  art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century  that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most  terrible of all the centuries before the 20th. May be counted toward the major in History.  Jill N. Claster   is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages.  She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as  Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been  the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great  Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently  working on a book about the Crusades. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 72841) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao  Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional  form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a  vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded  as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a  synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the  tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan  in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores  the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love  and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and  destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the  excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if  hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate  plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable  characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all  times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. Jing Wang   is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and  the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was  Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature .  Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and  the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and  comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to  literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Civil War at Rome (V28.0153; call # 75602) Instructor: Mich\u00e8le Lowrie Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  course examines the rich literature documenting the civil wars that  tore apart the Roman Republic in the first century BCE and the empire  in the first century CE. Contemporary and later writing of history,  epic, elegy, and lyric poetry finds civil war a defining experience for  Roman identity. The legend about Romulus and Remus puts fratricide at  the center of the city\u2019s foundation. The expanding empire found former  enemies drawn within, so that what previously was a war between city  states took on the coloring of civil contention retrospectively once  these areas were unified. Different sides elevate their leaders as  heroes in a cascading sequence: Caesar versus Pompey, Brutus and  Cassius versus Caesar, Antony and Octavian versus Brutus, Octavian  versus Antony. But what do the leaders stand for? Why does civil war  become a paradigm for thinking about the state? Is social violence the  reason Roman literature is obsessed with politics? We will examine the  differences between sedition, conspiracy, and civil war through the  writings of Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Livy,  Lucan, Tacitus, and Suetonius along with selections from the Greek  historians Plutarch and Appian. All materials will be read in English  translation. May be counted toward the major in Classics.  Mich\u00e8le Lowrie,   Associate Professor of Classics, teaches classes ranging from  elementary language to advanced graduate seminars. She specializes in  the literature of Republican and Augustan Rome and has published on the  majority of authors represented in the course, including a monograph on  Horace and an edited volume on the reception of Vergil. Current  research interests are ancient conceptions of foundation and  sovereignty, the role of the exemplum   as a figure that tells consequential narratives, and national identity.  The reception of Rome in modern literature and political thought is an  abiding concern. She recently organized a conference on this topic at  the University of Konstanz in Germany. Forthcoming are another  monograph, Writing, Performance, and Authority in Augustan Rome, and an anthology of articles on Horace. Transdisciplinary Investigations across Multiple Evolutionary Scales (V28.0154; call # 75429) Instructor: Tyler Volk Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  TIMES seminar will take on the basis of pattern itself across the  scales of nature and mind, and search for common functional principles  in those patterns. The guiding context is the fact that evolution as a  form-generating process, in the general sense, occurs on multiple  scales, such as biological (theory of evolution), cultural (invention  and social selection), and cognition (learning and directed  creativity). All these scales have unique but also similar subprocesses  of replication, variation, and selection. Therefore, where the  functional advantages of certain general solutions are the same to the  challenges of existence on different scales, we should expect to find  common patterns as those solutions. Students will find this an exciting  area of inquiry, and are expected to enlarge their intellectual  horizons as they engage in self-directed research in the context of a  diverse group. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll.    Tyler Volk is Associate Professor of Biology and also Director of Science in the new Environmental Studies Program. He is author of Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind ,  as well as of recent papers that elucidate the reasons for the  generation of common functional principles at different scales. He has  also looked at death as a functional aspect of life on multiple scales,  from bacteria to human psychology, in his book What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life \u2014and  so this view of transdisciplinary patterns has implications for  building bridges of understanding across scales. He is now working on a  project called \u201cthe evolution of gods.\u201d From Adam and Eve to the Trial of Jesus: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative (V28.0155; call # 75348) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The  Bible, as one of the foundational texts of Western civilization, is a  gallery of lively episodes that stimulate, nurture, or otherwise  challenge our sense and value of justice and injustice. Its  full-blooded characters gush forth with all their imperfections, and  their arresting lives present specimens of ethical problems that we  continue to confront in our everyday lives. In this course students  examine legal, moral, and normative existential issues embodied in the  dramas of such characters. In light of their episodes, themes that have  relevance to contemporary issues\u2014such as \u201caxis of evil,\u201d \u201ccommunal  responsibility,\u201d \u201cecological crisis,\u201d \u201cethics vs. religion,\u201d  \u201cgenocide,\u201d \u201choly war,\u201d \u201claw and ruler,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201creligious  intolerance,\u201d \u201csanctity of human life,\u201d and \u201csexual temptation and  moral obligation\u201d\u2014will be thoroughly scrutinized. Readings will cover  some key texts on the notion(s) of justice, readings from the Bible and  selected bibliographies for each of the biblical episodes. Students  will acquire tools to differentiate and hone their understanding of the  meaning of \u201cjustice\u201d and be challenged to reconsider, both critically  and creatively, their assumptions and apprehension of moral  responsibility, and ultimately, their own worldview and  self-understanding through a rereading of passages from the Bible. The  seminar will be taught at the Law School by law school methods  (\u201cSocratic\u201d interactive) and standards\u2014rigorous but academically and  intellectually rewarding. May be counted toward the major in Religious Studies or in Jewish History and Civilization.  J. H. H. Weiler   is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law  School. He serves as Director of The Straus Institute for the Advanced  Study of Law &amp; Justice and The Tikvah Center for Law and Jewish  Civilization. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law  School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and the Jean Monnet  Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy  of Arts and Sciences. He is the Editor-in-Chief of The European Journal of International Law . His recent publications include Un Europa Cristiana (translated into nine languages), The Constitution of Europe (translated into seven languages), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann . Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach (V28.0156; call # 75320) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday: 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Humans  are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that  others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by  justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this  phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist  systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of  justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in  the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains  an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s  nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one  can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally  sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any  subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence,  except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge  the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling  attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of  this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding. William Klein   teaches social foundations in NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies Program. In the  College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse  Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to  NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught  the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics,  from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under  a pen name) modern crime. Don Quixote (V28.0157; call # 75428) Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. This seminar explores the privileged position of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote   as first modern novel while also attending to the historical and  literary contexts from which it emerged. On one hand, our close reading  of Don Quixote considers how it is a work of recycling and crisis that  incorporates, parodies, and transforms all previous literary \u2014and many  non-literary\u2014 discourses to invent a new narrative form that does not  subscribe to any single poetics. On the other hand, this seminar  attempts to contextualize Cervantes\u2019s work within its historical  moment. To this end we consider some of the most important social,  political, economic, religious and cultural debates and institutions of  Renaissance Europe including Inquisition, imperial expansion, and  political and economic decline. We also explore questions of madness,  erotic and literary desire, authorship, subjectivity, the seductions  and the dangers of reading, the status of representation, translation,  literal vision versus literary visions, the workings of gender, race,  class and nation, and the tenuous frontiers between fiction and  history. The seminar is conducted in  English. Students may read the text in English (using Edith Grossman\u2019s  acclaimed translation) or in the original Spanish. May be counted  toward the major in Spanish or in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  Georgina Dopico Black is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and Editor of the Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies. She is the author of Perfect Wives, Other Women: Adultery and Inquisition in Early Modern Spain (2001), winner of the MLA\u2019s Katherine Singer Kovacs Prize and of Yale\u2019s Heyman Award. She has co-edited Suplemento al Tesoro de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias (2001), as well as two books on Cervantes: En un lugar de la Mancha (1999) and USA Cervantes (2008). Her current projects include one book on Don Quixote, another  on bodies and methods of truth production in the early modern period,  and a cultural history of medieval and Renaissance Spain. She has also  published articles on the morisco expulsion, the first Spanish  dictionary, Renaissance libraries, Inquisitorial torture, prostitution,  relics, and questions of national definition. The New York Dance Scene: Performance and Criticism Today (V28.0158; call # 75427) Instructor: Jennifer Homans Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  course offers a tour of today\u2019s dance scene in New York. We attend and  discuss performances ranging from classical ballet to \u201ccutting edge\u201d  contemporary dance. But seeing is only the beginning. Students also  study the historical roots of each performance we attend and read about  the artists involved (dancers and choreographers but also musicians and  designers). We evaluate each performance critically and historically,  and situate it within the larger cultural debates of our time. We study  classical ballet in its traditional and contemporary forms through  performances by New York City Ballet and Armitage Gone! Our examination  of the current state of American modern dance takes us to performances  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Dance Theater Workshop, and the  Baryshnikov Arts Center, among others. Students attend performances  every other week; the interim week is devoted to discussion and  analysis. In preparation for class, students read historical  background, biographies, and criticism, and each student prepares an  in-class presentation relating to the performances we attend. In  consultation with the instructor, students also select a topic or  artist for a final extended essay. Jennifer Homans is the dance critic for the New Republic   and a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at New York University. She  holds a Ph.D. in Modern European History, and her forthcoming book, Classical Ballet: A New History ,  is a cultural history that follows ballet from its origins in  17th-century France to the present. Her articles have also appeared in  the New York Times and the New York Review of Books.   In her previous career, she was a professional dancer, trained in  ballet, modern, and jazz techniques. She performed with the Chicago  Lyric Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet  and has danced a wide repertory, ranging from the ballet classics to  works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and other contemporary  choreographers. The Pastness of the Present: Exploring \u201cHistorically Informed Performance\u201d and \u201cHistorically Involved Composition\u201d (V28.0159; call # 75642) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. How  have performers of notated Western musics resolved the interpretive  dilemmas that result from performing musics which arose amidst distant  historical conditions and traditions? Tracing 19th- and 20th-century  answers to this question, students will explore the historically  informed performance movement in music studies. Concurrently, we will  consider what this movement\u2019s hypotheses and ethics might reveal if  used as a framework for viewing composers\u2019 confrontations with past  style practices. The ultimate goal of the course is to give students a  new set of questions with which to interrogate musical culture in the  21st century, and an intellectual framework with which to formulate  their own responses and experience. Case studies will be drawn from the  baroque period and the 19th and 20th centuries, and will include  selected examples of recent popular musics. The course should be of  interest to students majoring in music, history, philosophy, and other  disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. There are no prerequisites for this course. Ability to read music is strongly suggested, but is not required. Elizabeth Hoffman,   Associate Professor of Music, is the recipient of a Golden Dozen  Teaching Award. Her research interests include theories of tuning;  timbrally and texturally driven media forms; rhythmic complexity;  theories of notation and interpretation; aesthetics; the impact of  technology on creative thought; and the involvement of women in the  field of music composition. In addition to acoustic music, she composes  electroacoustic music, including works for stereo and multi-channel  sound, instrument and computer generated sound, and live  electroacoustic music. Her work has been recognized by artists grants  from the Seattle Arts Commission, a Bourges Residence Prize, and a Prix  Ars Electronica mention.                        Welcome!

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which  gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually  stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished  professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from  NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional,  cultural, and governmental leaders. In spring 2005, the College  of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which  extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors  Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small  classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the  wider New York community. In some instances students may count the  classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this  appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives. Advanced  Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact  with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to  challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis  and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct  their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an  environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students  and faculty alike. \u2014Dean Matthew S. Santirocco Course Descriptions    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72828) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of  the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court\u2019s  interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely  affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of  government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation  of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \u201cImperial  Judiciary.\u201d Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted  properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the  face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them,  and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the  Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines  current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis  and the Court\u2019s participation in the debate. Topics include abortion,  euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights,  gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; college  speech codes, including \u201chate\u201d speech and symbolic speech; and racial  and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court  cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the  political spectrum. Students are expected to apply critical thinking to  the topics. Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq.,   is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp;  Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School  of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree  from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and  taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of  Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepci\u00f3n  (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He  has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on  legal topics and is recognized in the International Who\u2019s Who\u2014Lawyers .  Mr. Pomerantz has participated in important and controversial matters  affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of  public artistic expression, right of privacy for acts of consenting  adults, and numerous free speech cases. The United States and the War on Terror: Terrorism, Counterterrorism, and National Security (V28.0122; call # 75545) Instructor: Karen J. Greenberg Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. In  the aftermath of 9/11, the United States launched a \u201cwar on terror\u201d and  in so doing challenged some of the basic assumptions of American  domestic and international policy. In the name of security, the powers  of the presidency, the nature of the courts, the role of the media, and  the limits of internationalism have come under scrutiny. This seminar  explores the questions that have come to the fore in the war on terror  and seeks to place them in historical context. The course will address,  among other topics, the balance between security and liberty,  Guantanamo Bay, detention and the roles of the Office of the Vice  President, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of  State, and the effectiveness of the United States as a partner in the  global war on terror. The course considers the changes that may be  required by a 21st century in which the emergence of security as a  vital concern has come to dominate questions of policy and philosophy. Karen J. Greenberg, Executive Director of the Center on Law and Security at the NYU School of Law, is the editor of the NYU Review of Law and Security . She co-edited The Enemy Combatant Papers: American Justice, the Courts, and the War on Terror; The Torture Papers: The Road to Abu Ghraib ; and is the editor of Al Qaeda Now and The Torture Debate in America . She is a frequent contributor on security issues for national publications. Origins of World War I (V28.0128; call # 72832) Instructor: Stewart A. Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  course explores the instability of the European state system in the  pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining  the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak  of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and  the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various  diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in  the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various  interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan  crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German  naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal  responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict,  and the attempts to contain it. May be counted toward the major in History.  Stewart A. Stehlin   is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the  development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th  centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic  history of the 19th and 20th centuries. His research has centered on  European cultural history, diplomatic history, and German history,  especially German-Vatican affairs. Among his publications are Bismarck and the Guelph Movement, 1866\u20131890, a translation of Friedrich Ratzel\u2019s Sketches of Urban and Cultural Life in North America , and Weimar and the Vatican, German-Vatican Diplomatic Relations between the Wars, 1919\u20131933 . He is currently working on a book, Rome and the Reich: German-Vatican Relations during the Kaiserreich, 1870\u20131919 . Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75298) Instructor: Michael A. Westerman Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. There  are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between  individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The  seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these  unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a  long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about  centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence\u2014what  place do our relationships with other people have in our lives?  Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic  interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones.  Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas  where these tensions appear, including models of child development,  approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy.  We also consider more \u201cinterpersonal\u201d versus more individual-centered  ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction  itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences.  We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers  suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of  psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout  the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions  by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which  contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person  from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar. Michael A. Westerman   is Associate Professor of Psychology. He also holds a Consulting  Faculty appointment in the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral  Sciences at Beth Israel Medical Center. His area of expertise is  clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics  concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of  mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist  relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles  on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a  program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of  psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of  interpersonal defense. Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 72834) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and  thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion  today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal,  medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and  gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed,  sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at  the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary  literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for  civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz   is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative  Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and  culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for  several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about  abortion, entitled \u201cVoices,\u201d in New York and Washington, D.C. \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited (V28.0144; call # 72836) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This  seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering  approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological  rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d  is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a  wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different  stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the  phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism,  totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or  distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill  the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal,  and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their  credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political  religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them  with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in  which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious  expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the  modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The  seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which  the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality  will need to occur. James Gilligan ,  Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and  directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system  while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of  Psychiatry.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 72839) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all  too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black  Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time  of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in  the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman  Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious  authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era,  there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms,  vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense  consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through  the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the  beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of  Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and  art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century  that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most  terrible of all the centuries before the 20th. May be counted toward the major in History.  Jill N. Claster   is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages.  She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as  Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been  the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great  Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently  working on a book about the Crusades. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 72841) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao  Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional  form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a  vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded  as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a  synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the  tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan  in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores  the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love  and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and  destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the  excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if  hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate  plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable  characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all  times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. Jing Wang   is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and  the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was  Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature .  Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and  the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and  comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to  literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Civil War at Rome (V28.0153; call # 75602) Instructor: Mich\u00e8le Lowrie Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  course examines the rich literature documenting the civil wars that  tore apart the Roman Republic in the first century BCE and the empire  in the first century CE. Contemporary and later writing of history,  epic, elegy, and lyric poetry finds civil war a defining experience for  Roman identity. The legend about Romulus and Remus puts fratricide at  the center of the city\u2019s foundation. The expanding empire found former  enemies drawn within, so that what previously was a war between city  states took on the coloring of civil contention retrospectively once  these areas were unified. Different sides elevate their leaders as  heroes in a cascading sequence: Caesar versus Pompey, Brutus and  Cassius versus Caesar, Antony and Octavian versus Brutus, Octavian  versus Antony. But what do the leaders stand for? Why does civil war  become a paradigm for thinking about the state? Is social violence the  reason Roman literature is obsessed with politics? We will examine the  differences between sedition, conspiracy, and civil war through the  writings of Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Livy,  Lucan, Tacitus, and Suetonius along with selections from the Greek  historians Plutarch and Appian. All materials will be read in English  translation. May be counted toward the major in Classics.  Mich\u00e8le Lowrie,   Associate Professor of Classics, teaches classes ranging from  elementary language to advanced graduate seminars. She specializes in  the literature of Republican and Augustan Rome and has published on the  majority of authors represented in the course, including a monograph on  Horace and an edited volume on the reception of Vergil. Current  research interests are ancient conceptions of foundation and  sovereignty, the role of the exemplum   as a figure that tells consequential narratives, and national identity.  The reception of Rome in modern literature and political thought is an  abiding concern. She recently organized a conference on this topic at  the University of Konstanz in Germany. Forthcoming are another  monograph, Writing, Performance, and Authority in Augustan Rome, and an anthology of articles on Horace. Transdisciplinary Investigations across Multiple Evolutionary Scales (V28.0154; call # 75429) Instructor: Tyler Volk Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  TIMES seminar will take on the basis of pattern itself across the  scales of nature and mind, and search for common functional principles  in those patterns. The guiding context is the fact that evolution as a  form-generating process, in the general sense, occurs on multiple  scales, such as biological (theory of evolution), cultural (invention  and social selection), and cognition (learning and directed  creativity). All these scales have unique but also similar subprocesses  of replication, variation, and selection. Therefore, where the  functional advantages of certain general solutions are the same to the  challenges of existence on different scales, we should expect to find  common patterns as those solutions. Students will find this an exciting  area of inquiry, and are expected to enlarge their intellectual  horizons as they engage in self-directed research in the context of a  diverse group. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll.    Tyler Volk is Associate Professor of Biology and also Director of Science in the new Environmental Studies Program. He is author of Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind ,  as well as of recent papers that elucidate the reasons for the  generation of common functional principles at different scales. He has  also looked at death as a functional aspect of life on multiple scales,  from bacteria to human psychology, in his book What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life \u2014and  so this view of transdisciplinary patterns has implications for  building bridges of understanding across scales. He is now working on a  project called \u201cthe evolution of gods.\u201d From Adam and Eve to the Trial of Jesus: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative (V28.0155; call # 75348) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The  Bible, as one of the foundational texts of Western civilization, is a  gallery of lively episodes that stimulate, nurture, or otherwise  challenge our sense and value of justice and injustice. Its  full-blooded characters gush forth with all their imperfections, and  their arresting lives present specimens of ethical problems that we  continue to confront in our everyday lives. In this course students  examine legal, moral, and normative existential issues embodied in the  dramas of such characters. In light of their episodes, themes that have  relevance to contemporary issues\u2014such as \u201caxis of evil,\u201d \u201ccommunal  responsibility,\u201d \u201cecological crisis,\u201d \u201cethics vs. religion,\u201d  \u201cgenocide,\u201d \u201choly war,\u201d \u201claw and ruler,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201creligious  intolerance,\u201d \u201csanctity of human life,\u201d and \u201csexual temptation and  moral obligation\u201d\u2014will be thoroughly scrutinized. Readings will cover  some key texts on the notion(s) of justice, readings from the Bible and  selected bibliographies for each of the biblical episodes. Students  will acquire tools to differentiate and hone their understanding of the  meaning of \u201cjustice\u201d and be challenged to reconsider, both critically  and creatively, their assumptions and apprehension of moral  responsibility, and ultimately, their own worldview and  self-understanding through a rereading of passages from the Bible. The  seminar will be taught at the Law School by law school methods  (\u201cSocratic\u201d interactive) and standards\u2014rigorous but academically and  intellectually rewarding. May be counted toward the major in Religious Studies or in Jewish History and Civilization.  J. H. H. Weiler   is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law  School. He serves as Director of The Straus Institute for the Advanced  Study of Law &amp; Justice and The Tikvah Center for Law and Jewish  Civilization. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law  School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and the Jean Monnet  Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy  of Arts and Sciences. He is the Editor-in-Chief of The European Journal of International Law . His recent publications include Un Europa Cristiana (translated into nine languages), The Constitution of Europe (translated into seven languages), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann . Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach (V28.0156; call # 75320) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday: 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Humans  are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that  others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by  justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this  phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist  systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of  justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in  the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains  an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s  nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one  can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally  sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any  subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence,  except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge  the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling  attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of  this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding. William Klein   teaches social foundations in NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies Program. In the  College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse  Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to  NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught  the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics,  from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under  a pen name) modern crime. Don Quixote (V28.0157; call # 75428) Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. This seminar explores the privileged position of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote   as first modern novel while also attending to the historical and  literary contexts from which it emerged. On one hand, our close reading  of Don Quixote considers how it is a work of recycling and crisis that  incorporates, parodies, and transforms all previous literary \u2014and many  non-literary\u2014 discourses to invent a new narrative form that does not  subscribe to any single poetics. On the other hand, this seminar  attempts to contextualize Cervantes\u2019s work within its historical  moment. To this end we consider some of the most important social,  political, economic, religious and cultural debates and institutions of  Renaissance Europe including Inquisition, imperial expansion, and  political and economic decline. We also explore questions of madness,  erotic and literary desire, authorship, subjectivity, the seductions  and the dangers of reading, the status of representation, translation,  literal vision versus literary visions, the workings of gender, race,  class and nation, and the tenuous frontiers between fiction and  history. The seminar is conducted in  English. Students may read the text in English (using Edith Grossman\u2019s  acclaimed translation) or in the original Spanish. May be counted  toward the major in Spanish or in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  Georgina Dopico Black is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and Editor of the Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies. She is the author of Perfect Wives, Other Women: Adultery and Inquisition in Early Modern Spain (2001), winner of the MLA\u2019s Katherine Singer Kovacs Prize and of Yale\u2019s Heyman Award. She has co-edited Suplemento al Tesoro de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias (2001), as well as two books on Cervantes: En un lugar de la Mancha (1999) and USA Cervantes (2008). Her current projects include one book on Don Quixote, another  on bodies and methods of truth production in the early modern period,  and a cultural history of medieval and Renaissance Spain. She has also  published articles on the morisco expulsion, the first Spanish  dictionary, Renaissance libraries, Inquisitorial torture, prostitution,  relics, and questions of national definition. The New York Dance Scene: Performance and Criticism Today (V28.0158; call # 75427) Instructor: Jennifer Homans Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  course offers a tour of today\u2019s dance scene in New York. We attend and  discuss performances ranging from classical ballet to \u201ccutting edge\u201d  contemporary dance. But seeing is only the beginning. Students also  study the historical roots of each performance we attend and read about  the artists involved (dancers and choreographers but also musicians and  designers). We evaluate each performance critically and historically,  and situate it within the larger cultural debates of our time. We study  classical ballet in its traditional and contemporary forms through  performances by New York City Ballet and Armitage Gone! Our examination  of the current state of American modern dance takes us to performances  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Dance Theater Workshop, and the  Baryshnikov Arts Center, among others. Students attend performances  every other week; the interim week is devoted to discussion and  analysis. In preparation for class, students read historical  background, biographies, and criticism, and each student prepares an  in-class presentation relating to the performances we attend. In  consultation with the instructor, students also select a topic or  artist for a final extended essay. Jennifer Homans is the dance critic for the New Republic   and a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at New York University. She  holds a Ph.D. in Modern European History, and her forthcoming book, Classical Ballet: A New History ,  is a cultural history that follows ballet from its origins in  17th-century France to the present. Her articles have also appeared in  the New York Times and the New York Review of Books.   In her previous career, she was a professional dancer, trained in  ballet, modern, and jazz techniques. She performed with the Chicago  Lyric Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet  and has danced a wide repertory, ranging from the ballet classics to  works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and other contemporary  choreographers. The Pastness of the Present: Exploring \u201cHistorically Informed Performance\u201d and \u201cHistorically Involved Composition\u201d (V28.0159; call # 75642) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. How  have performers of notated Western musics resolved the interpretive  dilemmas that result from performing musics which arose amidst distant  historical conditions and traditions? Tracing 19th- and 20th-century  answers to this question, students will explore the historically  informed performance movement in music studies. Concurrently, we will  consider what this movement\u2019s hypotheses and ethics might reveal if  used as a framework for viewing composers\u2019 confrontations with past  style practices. The ultimate goal of the course is to give students a  new set of questions with which to interrogate musical culture in the  21st century, and an intellectual framework with which to formulate  their own responses and experience. Case studies will be drawn from the  baroque period and the 19th and 20th centuries, and will include  selected examples of recent popular musics. The course should be of  interest to students majoring in music, history, philosophy, and other  disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. There are no prerequisites for this course. Ability to read music is strongly suggested, but is not required. Elizabeth Hoffman,   Associate Professor of Music, is the recipient of a Golden Dozen  Teaching Award. Her research interests include theories of tuning;  timbrally and texturally driven media forms; rhythmic complexity;  theories of notation and interpretation; aesthetics; the impact of  technology on creative thought; and the involvement of women in the  field of music composition. In addition to acoustic music, she composes  electroacoustic music, including works for stereo and multi-channel  sound, instrument and computer generated sound, and live  electroacoustic music. Her work has been recognized by artists grants  from the Seattle Arts Commission, a Bourges Residence Prize, and a Prix  Ars Electronica mention.                        Welcome!

A hands-on course in which students  learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological  processes. The course meets alternately in classroom and computer  laboratory settings. The techniques needed to perform such  simulations are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by  the students themselves, who work individually or in teams on  computing projects and report on these projects to the group as a  whole. Students learn how to make the computer generate graphics,  movies, and sounds as needed for presentation of the results of the  different simulations. Examples emphasized in class include the  orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of  diseases in a population; the production of sound by musical  instruments; and the electrical activity of nerves. Students may draw  their projects from this list or choose other projects according to  individual interests.          Language and Reality in 20th-Century  Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Ulfers. 4 points. Explores the possibility that a common  ground exists between the so-called two cultures of science and the  humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between  postclassical science (for example, quantum theory) and postmodern  literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are  Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d  of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions, and their  implications in literary works, revolves around their effect on  classical logic, the referential function of language, and the  traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality.  Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera,  Pirsig, and Pynchon, as well as from nontechnical texts on quantum  and chaos theories.          The Supreme Court and the Religion  Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the Native American  church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a  public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and  convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or  her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of  capital punishment or abortion? This course divides these questions  into three subject areas: religious liberty, separation of church and  state, and the role of religion in public and political life. It  focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more  important, invites students to construct a new vision of the proper  relationship among religion, state, and society in a 21st-century  liberal constitutional democracy.          First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Solomon. 4 points. Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt  into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge  indecency from online communications. A tobacco company sues a major  television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the  fair-trial rights of defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing trial.  Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any  governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact  balances free and open expression against other vital interests of  society. This course begins by examining the struggle against  seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its  officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark  decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine  freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary  conflicts, including political dissent that advocates overthrow of  the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning,  obscenity and pornography, the new law that bans indecency from  online services, hate speech, and inflictions of emotional distress.  Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme  Court.          From the Rise of Christianity to  Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia FRSEM-UA 282 Lehman. 4 points. The second decade of the new millennium  has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United  States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated  individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is  eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s  aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New  Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical  dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism.  We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive  moral and social transformations that have occurred in Western  civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our  seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity,  which focuses on formative developments during the first four  centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s  classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. We then  examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American  situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by  Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert  Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most  publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude  S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America, which paints a much more  upbeat picture of what is happening around us.          The Crusades and Their Legacy FRSEM-UA 296 Claster. 4 points. In the history of the interactions  among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at  the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters,  if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious  wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city  of Jerusalem. For 200 years, the Crusaders managed to hold on to  their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade,  until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was  lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades  themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great  religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for  their own. We study the differences among the religions, as well as  their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems  crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a  holy war, the issue of whether the Crusades were the first  manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East, and the  legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and  Christian writings of the era in translation, as well as secondary  works.          Latin America at the Start of the 21st  Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FRSEM-UA 306 Casta\u00f1eda. 4 points. Focuses on several aspects of Latin  America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today.  The seminar takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful,  and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of  independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of  representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during  the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff  today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and  the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil  society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and  vigor of civil society today. For each topic, readings deal with its  political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and  present.            Documentary Theatre FRSEM-UA 351 Martin. 4 points. Explores the subject matter, history,  and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of  contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary  theatre. By analyzing the content, structure, and dramatic devices of  a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of  the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of  human behavior from everyday life to important political events in  the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and  historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a  positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an  epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We read plays about the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial  clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of  Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the  cover-up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in  Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some  performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can  theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the  implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and  nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How  might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the  contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the  simulated, and the virtual?          Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Maynard. 4 points. Students in this seminar read a  selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from  the latter half of the 20th century, to learn to consider different  approaches to literature. They complete the course by preparing a  discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the  conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on  learning how to analyze theoretical problems and improvise in  applying them to new situations. Recommended for students interested  in any area of the humanities.    Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Sternhell. 4 points. Starting college can be  exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual  enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying  small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and  drugs. In this course, we read a selection of college novels from  different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s  This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War  I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about  the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a  contemporary Ivy university). We discuss these novels from a variety  of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition  to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at  least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their  own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres,  including fiction and nonfiction. Together, we explore this important  life passage, examining life as we live it.          Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies FRSEM-UA 377 Theodoratou. 4 points. The mythic figure of Medea has held our  imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of  casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason  and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an  exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and  vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often  punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think  about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile,  the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of  agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these  issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient  Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in  various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting,  cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for  her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and  to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and  recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will  consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present to think  about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and  conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.          Computational Thought FRSEM-UA 385 Prerequisite: AP  calculus, discrete mathematics, or some programming experience.  Shasha. 4 points. Computational technology and methods  lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and,  regrettably, war. Very powerful ideas underlie the field, with roots  in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some  of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a  puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and  evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds  on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and  biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture,  interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer  programs (in the programming language Python). Students make a few  presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions  to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of  linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian  psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about  computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those  perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.          Comfort and Suffering FRSEM-UA 393 Fulmer. 4 points. The purpose of this seminar is to  explore the nature of comfort and suffering as a human experience. We  examine related readings through the lens of the health care system  paradigm and use case studies to explore the wellness-illness  continuum of human experiences. Students become familiar with  conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, and social workers  as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is  continually balanced between comfort and suffering. Our discussions  on the nature of comfort and suffering focus on writings from the  Bible, which are contrasted with contemporary editorials and  publications, in order to examine historical changes in the way  individuals think about these important dimensions of the human  experience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable  opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to  discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the  psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care  needs create complexity in our lives. We debate the notion of  \u201cself-care,\u201d now very popular in the health care literature, and  contrast it with the concept of \u201cpatient abandonment.\u201d          Thirteen Masterworks of 20th-Century  Classical Music FRSEM-UA 397 Boorman. 4 points. The last hundred years have seen  radical changes in classical music, not only in the sound world but  also in aesthetic and technique\u2014ranging from the breakdown of  tonality and the use of electronic and computer resources in  performance to questions of the relationship of composer and  performer, of the place of noise, and even of what music is or could  be. This course presents outstanding works by a range of composers  (among them, Stravinsky, Carter, and Messiaen) both because of their  importance and as illustrations of ideas about music. Each  composition is explored for itself and also as a stimulus to  discussion about one or more of these issues. Each composition is one  that has stood the test of time and been hailed as a major work\u2014and  those criteria also need discussion. The course involves considerable  listening alongside readings. It requires a willingness to reassess  conventional views about music and to accept unconventional  solutions.        Alexis de Tocqueville FRSEM-UA 398 Berman. 4 points. Alexis de Tocqueville published  Democracy in America in two volumes, in 1835 and 1840. Those volumes  have come to be widely regarded as a masterpiece twice over, the most  incisive portrait of the American national character ever written,  and a profound reflection on the meaning of democracy itself.  Democracy in America is also a beautiful work of literature. This  seminar studies Democracy in America in depth. It looks at some of  Tocqueville\u2019s writings on his own country, France, and glances  briefly at his predecessor and kinsman, Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, who  visited America in the 1790s. By reading and discussing Tocqueville  and Chateaubriand, students sharpen their ability to think  philosophically about democracy, America, France, and other themes  and increase their ability to recognize and appreciate the art of  good writing.          The Meanings of Photography FRSEM-UA 400 Baer. 4 points. We live in an illustrated world, and  photographs have come to determine political, personal, and even the  most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is exonerated? Who  gets elected and who loses the vote? Whom do you like, will you get  to know, or want to be with? Whom you remember and whom will you  forget depend on how someone or something has been presented in a  photograph. To navigate this maze of images takes special skills.  Nowhere more powerfully than in photographs have the lines between  reality and fiction, truth and lie, been blurred. There is great  danger in this development and immense potential to free ourselves  from existing constraints, too. This interdisciplinary seminar  explores how photographic images create meaning and how they help us  make the worlds we live in. Particular attention is paid to the way  photography marks the often invisible difference between someone\u2019s  private world and the world at large. We read major theoretical texts  on photography, watch films where photographs play a decisive role,  and look at a wide range of photographs from the inception of the  medium to the current moment to test theories of photography against  the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real. Be  prepared to look closely and to think hard. Readings include texts by  Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, Vladimir Rodchenko, Andr\u00e9  Bazin, Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag, Geoffrey Batchen, Allan Sekula,  Vil\u00e9m Flusser, and Mario Vargas Llosa, as well as images by a  plethora of artists, professionals, and amateurs from around the  globe.          Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music,  Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition FRSEM-UA 427 Marcus. 4 points. A look at music and video games from  the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the  questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music  and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the  product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what  works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between  music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music?  Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The  primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving  as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of  disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology,  artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments  include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel  experiment.    COLLEGIATE SEMINARS        The Cultural Nature of Language COSEM-UA 101 Schieffelin. 4 points. From accents and pronouns to swearing  and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. We examine  language use as a social practice and analyze how speakers and their  language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts  and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t  (for example, feral children), we examine speech and silence across a  range of societies. We also look at popular attitudes toward language  and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (for  example, political correctness), in legal and educational  institutions (such as \u201cEnglish only\u201d), and in multilingual cities  (such as Barcelona and Montreal) to understand how ideas about  language are often recruited to nonlinguistic concerns, such as who  should be included or excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature  of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and  authority.          Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity COSEM-UA 102 Gilligan. 4 points. The past century has witnessed violence  the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that  we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide,  terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism,  fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we examine the origin  of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on  universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources  of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche  called this the \u201cdeath of God\u201d (and the Devil); it could also be  called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new  words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We study the origins  and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and  John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein,  Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from  Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we ask whether modern human sciences  can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this  escalation of violence.          In Search of Lost Time COSEM-UA 104 Clements. 4 points. We read Proust (in translation) as he  should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also  with delectation. A prodigious novel, 4,500 pages long, In Search of  Lost Time addresses literature\u2019s richest theme: desire\u2014its  remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence  in the form of art. More than 100 years old, often said to be the  first modern novel, it remains a dazzling portrait of the French beau  monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its author\u2019s  sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines  self-examination with social history, extraordinary psychological  acuity with the study of glamour and decadence, and how it merges an  audacious explosion of form with explorations of memory, attachment,  deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, disappointment, and ennui. It is  also one of the most pleasurable and elating reads. Although Marcel  Proust (1871\u20131922) is usually assumed to be France\u2019s greatest  novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately,  many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first 50  pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. While In  Search of Lost Time\u2019s prose style (playing on association,  evocation, magnification, punning, rhythm) may have been its most  radical contribution to the art of the novel, it cannot be understood  until it has been read once in its entirety. In this seminar, we keep  moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its  riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric  experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained. Required  reading: an average of 350 pages per week.          American Wars, Past and Present:  Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan COSEM-UA 106 Young. 4 points. Considers the last two major wars of  the 20th century and the first two of the 21st century. The seminar  begins with the history, memory, and subsequent political uses of the  Vietnam War. We then move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation  Desert Storm), which was shaped by the way the administration of  President George H. W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The  subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in  part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished  business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was fought in the shadow of  Vietnam analogies. Finally, the war in Afghanistan, launched in  response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and goals, has been shaped by  all three of the preceding wars. We examine these wars through  primary documents and secondary sources, as well as the abundance of  documentary and fiction film in which they have all been represented.  The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of  American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over  three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history  teach? What does it teach?          Zoo\u00ebsis: Animal Acts for Changing  Times COSEM-UA 107 Chaudhuri. 4 points. The emerging field of animal studies  has already generated neologisms in various disciplines:  \u201canthrozoology\u201d (culture studies), \u201czoopolis\u201d (urban social  theory), and \u201czoontology\u201d (philosophy). To these the fields of  literature and performance studies propose an addition, \u201czoo\u00ebsis,\u201d  to refer to the history of animal representation that stretches, in  the Western literary tradition, from Aesop\u2019s Fables to Will Self\u2019s  Great Apes; in the Western dramatic tradition, from Aristophanes\u2019  The Frogs to Albee\u2019s The Goat; in film, from Muybridge\u2019s  \u201czoogyroscope\u201d to Herzog\u2019s Grizzly Man; in popular culture,  from Mickey Mouse to Animal Planet; and in popular performance, from  gladiatorial contests to Siegfried and Roy. To speak of zoo\u00ebsis is  also to acknowledge the manifold performances engendered by cultural  animal practices such as dog shows, keeping pets, equitation, rodeo,  bullfighting, animal sacrifice, scientific experimentation,  taxidermy, hunting, wearing fur, eating meat\u2014each with its own  archive and repertory, its own performers and spectators. We study  recent films, novels, plays, and cultural events that reveal how our  interaction with animals shapes our understanding of the human, our  approach to the \u201cOther\u201d (including the racial and ethnic  \u201cOther\u201d), and our attitude toward the world.          Matter, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy COSEM-UA 108 Farrar. 4 points. The past several decades have seen  tremendous advances in observational cosmology. As a result, we  understand in remarkable detail many aspects of the evolution and  contents of the universe. This course focuses on three of the most  puzzling facts about the universe: Why was there a slight excess of  matter over antimatter after the Big Bang? (Otherwise, after  matter-antimatter annihilation was complete, no matter would have  been left.) What is dark matter? (Although on average in the universe  it is five times more abundant than normal matter, we know that it is  something not found on earth or, so far, observed in our  laboratories.) What is so-called \u201cdark energy\u201d? (The expansion  rate of the universe is actually accelerating, rather than slowing  down as was expected, a finding attributed to this new component of  the universe.) Students enrolling in the seminar should have taken AP  Physics, be enrolled in Physics I (PHYS-UA 91), or have permission of  the instructor.          How We See COSEM-UA 109 Carrasco. 4 points. Do we see the world the way we do  because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is?  The ease with which we comprehend the visual world and recognize  objects and events makes it tempting to think that the world is just  the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for  granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the  information available in the environment, when we try to build  machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some  specific visual capability\u2014for example, those who can no longer  recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the  machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know  about vision from multiple scientific perspectives. Perceptual  psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides  important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms;  neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these  mechanisms malfunction; and neuroscience tells us about processes at  the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss  modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different  perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of  experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new  neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?          Great Science, Fabulous Science, and  Voodoo Science COSEM-UA 111 Mincer. 4 points. Science is often portrayed as following  a very clearly defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do  an experiment, and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or  adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is  rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told  or recorded may differ from what really happened. We study some  famous and infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences,  selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, cases of error,  cases of fraud, and the murky boundaries between them. Along the way,  issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias,  and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are  discussed. To take this course, students should have had high school  chemistry, physics, and calculus.          Finding New York City COSEM-UA 114 Serrin. 4 points. In this seminar, students explore,  read, and write about\u2014and develop a deep understanding of\u2014New  York City from diverse perspectives and by means of various media. We  venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic areas, all five  boroughs, out on the Hudson and East rivers, restaurants, parks, and  the like. We examine New York history and how the city has changed  over the decades, writing several pieces on what we see and read and  what people tell us. In the end, all should have an understanding of  how New York City began, how it has changed over time, what remains  from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the future  might be. This is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New  York City as its laboratory. The seminar turns to reading the  splendid books or sections from the splendid books that deal with  important aspects of the history and life of New York City, among  them The Island at the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties;  Forgotten Patriots; The Devil\u2019s Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots  and the Fight to Reconstruct America; Five Points; Positively 4th  Street; and A Freewheelin\u2019 Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in  the Sixties. It also considers how the image of New York City in the  movies has changed over the decades, drawing in part on the book  Celluloid Skyline. In addition, it uses parts of the Ken Burns\u2019s  PBS documentary series New York City.          Russia\u2019s Multicultural Empire COSEM-UA 116 Burbank. 4 points. From the 16th century to the present, \u201cRussia\u201d has been an empire\u2014a state that spread its power over different peoples, with different religious commitments, different laws and customs, and different histories. Even after the quite peaceful breakup of the USSR, the Russian Federation is the largest country in the world, and still a multi-ethnic state. What held the vast territories and populations, ruled by tsars, and later communists, together? Why has Russia not disintegrated or been torn apart by multiple wars among its many ethnic groups since 1991? This seminar will explore these questions through readings, discussions, and research. We will examine how Russian leaders ruled their many populations and how people living on the terrain of a succession of Russian empires\u2014the Grand Princedom of Muscovy, imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation\u2014have imagined their relations with each other and with these states. Our sources include historians\u2019 studies, literature, and documents of many types: games, maps, laws, and films. Each student will write a research paper concerning a particular imperial situation, and we work together to understand the origins, habits, and effects of Russia\u2019s empires of difference.          Impossible Writing COSEM-UA 118 Foer. 4 points. As with any art, literature\u2019s form  determines what is possible. In this course, we challenge the  boundaries of the form through a series of \u201cimpossible\u201d  exercises\u2014that is, pieces of writing that are asked to do what  writing cannot do. For example, one assignment challenges  literature\u2019s unique portability by generating \u201csite-specific\u201d  stories around campus. Another assignment focuses on the lack of  explicit tonality and atmosphere in writing by generating oral  stories. In our discussions about the work produced, we explore the  ways that these radical techniques can be brought into more  traditional writing. The course focuses on the production of work,  and students are expected to produce a piece of writing every week,  usually between two paragraphs and four pages.          Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War  and U.S. Culture COSEM-UA 119 Fern\u00e1ndez. 4 points The Great Depression. Liberal democracy  in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from  anarchism to fascism, offering solutions to the afflictions of people  all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts  to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government.  All eyes turn toward Spain. This seminar is centered on NYU\u2019s  Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of  materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who,  between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. We  explore the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in  American culture from the 1930s forward; how journalists, writers,  artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain; and how the legacy  of the war has affected U.S. culture over the last 70 years. Each  student completes a major research project based on the holdings of  ALBA.          Utopia and Apocalypse COSEM-UA 120 Borenstein. 4 points. The utopian impulse is the drive to  create the perfect world; the apocalypse is the global cataclysm that  is often considered utopia\u2019s prerequisite. In this seminar, we  examine the development of the utopian tradition, as both literary  genre and philosophical thought experiment. Among the questions to be  considered: What is the relationship between utopia and the novel?  How do we get from \u201chere\u201d (the imperfect world) to \u201cthere\u201d  (the perfect one), and how is this journey enacted in fiction? Why  are the family, gender, and sexuality so central to the utopian  tradition? What is the utopian conception of pleasure? Utopia is  often seen as the culmination of historical progress, the goal toward  which humanity has been striving. Later utopian (and anti-utopian)  fictions often place their \u201cperfect\u201d societies in a  post-apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and temporal  dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint of  history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to  justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials consist of  fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including  the works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels,  More, Moore and Gibbons, and Plato.          Moral Dilemmas of Work and Care in the  21st Century COSEM-UA 121 Gerson. 4 points. Modern societies have long sought to  reconcile the conflict between self-development and caring for others  by dividing women and men into different moral categories. Structural  arrangements (such as the separation of home and work) and cultural  pressures (such as the norms of intensive motherhood and  good-providing fatherhood) expect women to find personal fulfillment  in caring for others and men to care for others by sharing the  rewards of their independent pursuits. Yet the rise of fluid families  and post-industrial workplaces has severely undermined this gender  division of \u201cmoral labor.\u201d As women take on increasing economic  responsibilities and men face a dwindling pool of stable jobs, rigid  moral categories have given way to new moral dilemmas. In crafting an  identity, how do women and men balance work commitments with a  personal life? In forming adult relationships, how do they weigh the  need for autonomy with the desire for enduring commitment? In caring  for children, how do they trade off earning a living with family  time? This course examines the link between blurring gender  boundaries and the rise of new moral dilemmas of work and care. We  examine the institutional roots of these dilemmas, explore the new  strategies people are developing to resolve them, and consider the  social and political consequences of these revolutionary shifts.          Exploring the Mysteries of Behavior COSEM-UA 122 Kiorpes. 4 points. Did you ever wonder how whales navigate  flawlessly over thousands of miles? Why songbirds sing? This course  provides an in-depth look at a variety of organisms that have evolved  particular, special behavioral adaptations as solutions to  environmental challenges. Each neural system to be studied highlights  a unique combination of behavioral skill and environmental problem to  be solved. For example, echolocation in bats is a navigation device  and an adaptive hunting system that allows them to successfully hunt  on the wing; infrared sensing in snakes is an effective prey  localization and defense mechanism, enhancing their survival in the  absence of limbs. Students learn basic principles of sensory, motor,  and cognitive neuroscience and study the mechanisms underlying the  natural behavior of organisms. Students independently identify  unique, species-specific behavioral adaptations and explore the  neural mechanisms related to those adaptations. The resulting  investigation forms the basis for a term paper and an oral  presentation to the class. A high degree of student participation is  expected. A textbook as well as primary research articles will  comprise the readings. Students should have a strong background in  biology, animal behavior, or psychology.          The Mysteries of Paris: Detective  Fiction in France COSEM-UA 125 Miller. 4 points. While critics debate the origins of  detective fiction, no one questions the central place this literary  genre holds in contemporary arts production\u2014not only in novels but  also in television, computer games, and film. In France alone,  detective (or mystery) fiction accounts for 20 percent of all novels  purchased during the year. The French, in fact, have inflected the  genre in very particular ways: For example, thanks to the fascination  of the great 19th-century writers Balzac and Hugo with the real-life  police detective Vidocq, the \u201cambiguous and obsessed\u201d fictional  investigator has become a staple of both French and American  detective fiction. The Franco-American connection also inspired  author Edgar Allan Poe to situate his mysteries on Paris\u2019s Rue  Morgue. In turn, his stories prompted a major output of detective  fiction during France\u2019s Second Empire, many located in the \u201cCity  of Lights.\u201d From Gaston Leroux\u2019s and Eug\u00e8ne Sue\u2019s urban  thrillers of the late 19th century to Daniel Pennac\u2019s hilarious  multi-cultural adventures in Belleville, the hippest neighborhood of  the 21st century, Paris has thus become a site to be decoded and  observed, the crucible for questions basic to detective fiction the  world over: Why do people commit crimes? What are the consequences  for the individual and for society? What is the nature of evil? And  what kind of human being dedicates himself or herself to finding out  the answers? In this seminar, we analyze what constitutes a detective  or mystery novel (and discuss the potential differences between  \u201cdetective\u201d and \u201cmystery\u201d), trace the development of the  genre in France, and examine why it is that reading such works is so  compelling. We focus primarily on novels in which Paris plays a major  role, studying how the city has been used to give shape to the  underlying questions of the novel. We see, perhaps unsurprisingly,  that French-language detective fiction has been as involved in  imagining a mysterious Paris as in solving Paris\u2019s mysteries.          Consuming China, Past and Present COSEM-UA 127 Waley-Cohen. 4 points. Material culture and consumption in  China from imperial times to the present. This course explores some  of the ways in which commerce and consumerism have flourished in  China despite various potentially countervailing factors, including  Confucians\u2019 presumed aversion to trade, Buddhist and Daoist  renunciations of material things, wartime deprivations under the  Republic, rising egalitarianism, and Communist Party denunciations of  bourgeois ideals of consumption. We will investigate such aspects as  clothing and cosmetics; houses and gardens; art collecting and  connoisseurship; books and publishing; food and narcotics; opera and  theatre. While illuminating Chinese social and cultural life,  including aspects of continuity or change over several centuries, the  course also introduces students to theoretical concepts about  modernity\u2019s relationship to the world of goods and consumption, and  considers whether and to what extent those concepts, formulated in a  largely western context, may or may not be applicable to China.          Understanding 9/11 COSEM-UA 128 Gerety. 4 points. Examines the 9/11 attacks from an  interdisciplinary perspective, seeking to reach a better  understanding of the attack itself, the motivations and backgrounds  of the attackers, the failures in the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s  defenses\u2014and above all, the nature and scope of America\u2019s  response, at home and abroad. We read studies of terrorism and  counter-terrorism, including moral and legal arguments about torture,  detention, and targeted killings. We visit various sites in New York  City and meet with people with direct experience of the attack and  its aftermath, including representatives of both the police and the  immigrant communities who have suffered profiling and mistrust from  the suspicions aroused by the attack. Looking toward the future, we  examine local, national, and international strategies to prevent such  attacks and to halt the radicalization that brings fresh recruits to  terrorist movements.    ADVANCED HONORS SEMINARS          The History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Stephens. 4 points. Takes up an extended history of atheism  and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It begins in  Greece and then moves on to a brief discussion of anthropological  perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, to the Hebrews  and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  romantic period. Time is spent in England and America in the 19th  century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God are considered. However, the main purpose of this course is to  force students to confront and grapple with some of the most  sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors  read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky,  Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud.          Varieties of Religious Experience  Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Gilligan. 4 points. Uses but also updates William James\u2019s  pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in  psychological rather than theological terms. Examines how the term  \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing than helpful when it fails to  differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs  and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional  development. Discusses the phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d  (nationalism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as  attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in  order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in  the soul of modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources  of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason)  lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. Considers that  political religions result from psychological regression and  contrasts them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding, and experience consistent with  the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it.  Concludes by examining whether this is the context in which the next  major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need  to occur.          The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Claster. 4 points. The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was the century of the Black Death and the decimation of  the population on an enormous and unprecedented scale; a time of an  economic recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had  existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and  the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to  religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the  same era, there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political  forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of  immense consequence for all of Europe and for our own culture.  Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are  the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age  of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters and writers who transformed the nature and conception of  literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall, we  study a century that many historians have understood as the most  creative and the most terrible of all the centuries until the 20th  century.          The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Cross-listed with  Photography and Imaging of the Tisch School of the Arts as PHTI-UT  1120. Willis. 4 points. Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums, and galleries. Each week, students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.          Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber AHSEM-UA 149 Wang. 4 points. The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic  literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th  century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as  \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese  culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of  the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese  aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story  between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China  at its dramatic center, the novel intimately explores the questions  concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection,  or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys  life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses  and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden,  social and class tensions. Its manifold structure and intricate plot  development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters,  make this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both  reading and discussions are conducted in English.          Transdisciplinary Investigations Across  Multiple Evolutionary Scales AHSEM-UA 154 Volk. 4 points. This TIMES seminar considers the most  basic patterns across the realms of nature and mind and searches for  common functional principles that create those patterns. The guiding  context is the fact that evolution is a form-generating process. In a  general sense, evolution occurs on multiple scales: biological  (Darwinian evolution), cultural (invention and social selection), and  cognition (learning and creativity). All these scales possess unique  but also similar subprocesses of replication, variation, and  selection. Therefore, where the functional advantages of certain  solutions are the same to the challenges of existence across the  realms, we should expect to find common patterns as those solutions.  (See the instructor\u2019s book and papers on \u201cmetapatterns\u201d for  more.) Students find this an exciting area of inquiry and enlarge  their intellectual horizons as they engage in research that becomes  more self-chosen during the course. Students from all disciplines are  encouraged to enroll.          Reconstructing World Violence: A  Hobbesian Approach AHSEM-UA 156 Klein. 4 points. Humans are as violent as any creature,  but we have something in abundance that others may lack: the ability  to sustain and glorify our violence by justifying it. After  attempting to develop coherent accounts of this phenomenon, students  consider ways in which pacifist systems of thought have interacted  with violent systems of justification, often but not always with  genocidal results. It was in the midst of such a violent crisis that  Hobbes initiated what remains an undeveloped approach. If one can  extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s nationalist agenda and redirect his  approach in a democratic way, one can arrive (as many have) at the  following claim: Only when globally sovereign conflict-resolving  institutions are fully authorized will any subordinate system  justifying violence lose its force and coherence, except in the case  of violent revolutionary movements that challenge the global  authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling attempts to  operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of this claim  not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding.          Edmund Wilson and the Art of Cultural  Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Cross-listed with  Journalism as JOUR-UA 401. Berman. 4 points. Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political,  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic, the New Yorker,  the New York Review of Books and other magazines. Reading a  substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a series of  large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of Greenwich Village  early in the 20th century; the rise of literary modernism; the  influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War; and various  traditions of American thought and literature over the centuries. We  will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of journalistic writing:  his emphases on clarity, on conversational ease, and on emotional  forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply Wilson\u2019s principles  of writing to their own compositions\u2014an extremely useful thing to  do for any student who seeks to become a better writer.             Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Cross-listed with History  as HIST-UA 664. Please note that this course does not satisfy the  advanced research seminar requirement for the history major. Nash. 4  points. Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It explores  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, and oral memoirs; view films;  and read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, is our laboratory. Students work  with archives and other special collections on a weekly basis,  learning how to use and evaluate these primary sources, interpret  evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research questions.             Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Cross-listed with  Comparative Literature as COLIT-UA 181. Bishop. 4 points. The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s  What Is Literature?          The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Cross-listed with Spanish  as SPAN-UA 952. Black. 4 points. In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth.\u201d While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late 15th through  late 17th centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism (the conversos),  Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and Illuminati, witches,  Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those accused of sexual or  religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and sodomy). We close the  semester considering what finally brought about the definitive  abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read transcripts from  Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations, historical  chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an Inquisitor\u2019s manual  with instructions for torture, a witch-hunting treatise, and  devotional literature. We also will examine more contemporary  reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers Karamazov, Monty  Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish Inquisition\u201d skit,  and the film adaptation of J. K. Rowling\u2019s 2003 Harry Potter and  the Order of the Phoenix.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which  gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually  stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished  professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from  NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional,  cultural, and governmental leaders. In spring 2005, the College  of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which  extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors  Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small  classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the  wider New York community. In some instances students may count the  classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this  appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives. Advanced  Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact  with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to  challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis  and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct  their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an  environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students  and faculty alike. \u2014Dean Matthew S. Santirocco Course Descriptions    Current Political and Moral Conflicts and the U.S. Constitution (V28.0116; call # 72828) Instructor: Alan J. Pomerantz Wednesday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  U.S. political and moral debate has moved steadily into the realm of  the Supreme Court. Some have strongly argued that the Court\u2019s  interpretation and application of the Constitution have adversely  affected our fundamental rights, usurped powers from other branches of  government, disregarded all notions of federalism, upset the separation  of powers necessary for a stable democracy, and created an \u201cImperial  Judiciary.\u201d Others have argued as strongly that the Court has acted  properly to protect fundamental freedoms and individual rights in the  face of unprecedented political and governmental efforts to limit them,  and in doing so has fulfilled the role envisioned for the Court by the  Constitution. Conducted by the Socratic method, the seminar examines  current controversial political issues that have a constitutional basis  and the Court\u2019s participation in the debate. Topics include abortion,  euthanasia, medical life support, and capital punishment; gay rights,  gay marriage, and acts in private among consenting adults; college  speech codes, including \u201chate\u201d speech and symbolic speech; and racial  and ethnic profiling. Participants read the relevant Supreme Court  cases, news reports, and political and legal commentary from across the  political spectrum. Students are expected to apply critical thinking to  the topics. Alan J. Pomerantz, Esq.,   is a practicing lawyer and partner of Orrick, Herrington &amp;  Sutcliffe, a major international law firm. A graduate of the NYU School  of Law, he also studied in Chile and received an advanced legal degree  from the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands). He has lectured and  taught widely, including at the NYU School of Law, the University of  Amsterdam, Columbia Graduate School, the University of Concepci\u00f3n  (Chile), the School of Visual Arts, and Hunter College High School. He  has published numerous articles and contributed to several treatises on  legal topics and is recognized in the International Who\u2019s Who\u2014Lawyers .  Mr. Pomerantz has participated in important and controversial matters  affecting individual rights, including death penalty appeals, rights of  public artistic expression, right of privacy for acts of consenting  adults, and numerous free speech cases. The United States and the War on Terror: Terrorism, Counterterrorism, and National Security (V28.0122; call # 75545) Instructor: Karen J. Greenberg Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. In  the aftermath of 9/11, the United States launched a \u201cwar on terror\u201d and  in so doing challenged some of the basic assumptions of American  domestic and international policy. In the name of security, the powers  of the presidency, the nature of the courts, the role of the media, and  the limits of internationalism have come under scrutiny. This seminar  explores the questions that have come to the fore in the war on terror  and seeks to place them in historical context. The course will address,  among other topics, the balance between security and liberty,  Guantanamo Bay, detention and the roles of the Office of the Vice  President, Department of Justice, Department of Defense, Department of  State, and the effectiveness of the United States as a partner in the  global war on terror. The course considers the changes that may be  required by a 21st century in which the emergence of security as a  vital concern has come to dominate questions of policy and philosophy. Karen J.

Stehlin Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  course explores the instability of the European state system in the  pre-1914 era and the causes and responsibility for the war by examining  the contributions of each of the major European states to the outbreak  of war. It considers the Bismarckian system of European diplomacy and  the balance of power as it existed before the war, the various  diplomatic crises before 1914, the interrelation of internal events in  the various countries to their foreign policy, and the various  interpretations of the causes of the war. Topics include the Moroccan  crises, the weaknesses of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Anglo-German  naval and economic rivalries, the Balkan struggles for independence,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand at Sarajevo, the personal  responsibility of the individual statesmen, the ever-widening conflict,  and the attempts to contain it. May be counted toward the major in History.  Stewart A. Stehlin   is Professor Emeritus of History. His areas of teaching have been the  development of the modern European state system in the 19th and 20th  centuries, the history of modern Germany, and European diplomatic  history of the 19th and 20th centuries.

Rethinking Who We Are: Interpersonal Approaches to the Person (V28.0129; call # 75298) Instructor: Michael A. Westerman Monday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. There  are unresolved tensions in the field of psychology between  individual-centered models of the person and interpersonal ones. The  seminar is based on the belief that in order to make progress on these  unresolved issues we need to recognize that they refer to a  long-standing fundamental question philosophers began wondering about  centuries before the discipline of psychology came into existence\u2014what  place do our relationships with other people have in our lives?  Moreover, we need to engage in an inquiry that involves a dynamic  interplay between psychological considerations and philosophical ones.  Participants in the seminar learn about work in several specific areas  where these tensions appear, including models of child development,  approaches to psychopathology, and basic questions about psychotherapy.  We also consider more \u201cinterpersonal\u201d versus more individual-centered  ways in which psychologists think about interpersonal interaction  itself. The final topic concerns the philosophy of the social sciences.  We look at recent contributions by psychologists and philosophers  suggesting that we replace traditional concepts of the process of  psychological research with a social view of that process. Throughout  the seminar, we refer to classic philosophical texts and contributions  by historians of ideas to explore critically the ways in which  contemporary efforts by psychologists reflect concepts of the person  from our philosophical tradition. Students who have taken V50.0247 may not register for this seminar. Michael A. Westerman   is Associate Professor of Psychology. He also holds a Consulting  Faculty appointment in the Department of Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral  Sciences at Beth Israel Medical Center. His area of expertise is  clinical psychology. He has conducted research on several topics  concerning interpersonal relationships, including studies of  mother-child interaction, family systems, and the patient-therapist  relationship in psychotherapy. His publications also include articles  on issues in philosophical psychology. He is currently involved in a  program of research based on an interpersonal reconceptualization of  psychological defenses he has developed that is called the theory of  interpersonal defense. Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 72834) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and  thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion  today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal,  medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and  gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed,  sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at  the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary  literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for  civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz   is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative  Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and  culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for  several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about  abortion, entitled \u201cVoices,\u201d in New York and Washington, D.C. \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited (V28.0144; call # 72836) Instructor: James Gilligan Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This  seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering  approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological  rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d  is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a  wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different  stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the  phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism,  totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or  distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill  the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of  modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal,  and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their  credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political  religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them  with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in  which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious  expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the  modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The  seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which  the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality  will need to occur.

The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was Transformed (V28.0147; call # 72839) Instructor: Jill N. Claster Thursday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The  century covered in this course saw disasters of many kinds, some all  too familiar to us in the 20th century. It was a time of the Black  Death and the decimation of the population on an enormous scale; a time  of recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had existed in  the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and the Roman  Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to religious  authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the same era,  there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political forms,  vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of immense  consequence for all of Europe . . . and for our own culture. Through  the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are the  beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age of  Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters who transformed the nature and conception of literature and  art and who informed our own worldview. Overall we will study a century  that many historians have understood as the most creative and the most  terrible of all the centuries before the 20th. May be counted toward the major in History.  Jill N. Claster   is Professor of History Emerita with a specialty in the Middle Ages.  She has served as Dean of the College of Arts and Science and as  Director of the Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies. She has been  the recipient of a Fulbright grant and was honored with the Great  Teacher Award by the Alumni Association of NYU. She is currently  working on a book about the Crusades. Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber (V28.0149; call # 72841) Instructor: Jing Wang Thursday, 4:55\u20137:25 p.m. The  Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic literary classic produced by Cao  Xueqin in the middle of the 18th century. Following the traditional  form of Chinese fiction, known as \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a  vast terrain of Chinese culture and social life and is widely regarded  as the culmination of the vernacular novel of imperial China and a  synthesis of Chinese aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the  tragic love story between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan  in southern China at its dramatic center the novel intimately explores  the questions concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love  and affection, or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and  destroys life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the  excesses and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if  hidden, social and class tensions. Its manifold structure, intricate  plot development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable  characters, makes this novel the most complex and colorful of all  times. Both reading and discussions are conducted in English. Jing Wang   is Assistant Research Scholar in the College of Arts and Science and  the Department of East Asian Studies, where, from 1999 to 2006, she was  Lecturer in Chinese. She is the editor and translator of Anthology of Short Stories by American Women Writers in the 1990\u2019s (2002). In 2000, she was the featured columnist/translator on foreign literature for the literary magazine Shanghai Literature .  Her teaching and research interests include women writers in China and  the West, literary translation, modern Chinese social thought, and  comparative studies of cities and urban culture. In addition to  literary translations, she also publishes personal essays. Civil War at Rome (V28.0153; call # 75602) Instructor: Mich\u00e8le Lowrie Monday and Wednesday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This  course examines the rich literature documenting the civil wars that  tore apart the Roman Republic in the first century BCE and the empire  in the first century CE. Contemporary and later writing of history,  epic, elegy, and lyric poetry finds civil war a defining experience for  Roman identity. The legend about Romulus and Remus puts fratricide at  the center of the city\u2019s foundation. The expanding empire found former  enemies drawn within, so that what previously was a war between city  states took on the coloring of civil contention retrospectively once  these areas were unified. Different sides elevate their leaders as  heroes in a cascading sequence: Caesar versus Pompey, Brutus and  Cassius versus Caesar, Antony and Octavian versus Brutus, Octavian  versus Antony. But what do the leaders stand for? Why does civil war  become a paradigm for thinking about the state? Is social violence the  reason Roman literature is obsessed with politics? We will examine the  differences between sedition, conspiracy, and civil war through the  writings of Cicero, Caesar, Sallust, Vergil, Horace, Propertius, Livy,  Lucan, Tacitus, and Suetonius along with selections from the Greek  historians Plutarch and Appian. All materials will be read in English  translation. May be counted toward the major in Classics.  Mich\u00e8le Lowrie,   Associate Professor of Classics, teaches classes ranging from  elementary language to advanced graduate seminars. She specializes in  the literature of Republican and Augustan Rome and has published on the  majority of authors represented in the course, including a monograph on  Horace and an edited volume on the reception of Vergil. Current  research interests are ancient conceptions of foundation and  sovereignty, the role of the exemplum   as a figure that tells consequential narratives, and national identity.  The reception of Rome in modern literature and political thought is an  abiding concern. She recently organized a conference on this topic at  the University of Konstanz in Germany. Forthcoming are another  monograph, Writing, Performance, and Authority in Augustan Rome, and an anthology of articles on Horace. Transdisciplinary Investigations across Multiple Evolutionary Scales (V28.0154; call # 75429) Instructor: Tyler Volk Monday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  TIMES seminar will take on the basis of pattern itself across the  scales of nature and mind, and search for common functional principles  in those patterns. The guiding context is the fact that evolution as a  form-generating process, in the general sense, occurs on multiple  scales, such as biological (theory of evolution), cultural (invention  and social selection), and cognition (learning and directed  creativity). All these scales have unique but also similar subprocesses  of replication, variation, and selection. Therefore, where the  functional advantages of certain general solutions are the same to the  challenges of existence on different scales, we should expect to find  common patterns as those solutions. Students will find this an exciting  area of inquiry, and are expected to enlarge their intellectual  horizons as they engage in self-directed research in the context of a  diverse group. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll.    Tyler Volk is Associate Professor of Biology and also Director of Science in the new Environmental Studies Program. He is author of Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind ,  as well as of recent papers that elucidate the reasons for the  generation of common functional principles at different scales. He has  also looked at death as a functional aspect of life on multiple scales,  from bacteria to human psychology, in his book What Is Death?: A Scientist Looks at the Cycle of Life \u2014and  so this view of transdisciplinary patterns has implications for  building bridges of understanding across scales. He is now working on a  project called \u201cthe evolution of gods.\u201d From Adam and Eve to the Trial of Jesus: Justice and Injustice in Biblical Narrative (V28.0155; call # 75348) Instructor: J. H. H. Weiler Thursday, 9:30 a.m.\u201312:00 p.m. The  Bible, as one of the foundational texts of Western civilization, is a  gallery of lively episodes that stimulate, nurture, or otherwise  challenge our sense and value of justice and injustice. Its  full-blooded characters gush forth with all their imperfections, and  their arresting lives present specimens of ethical problems that we  continue to confront in our everyday lives. In this course students  examine legal, moral, and normative existential issues embodied in the  dramas of such characters. In light of their episodes, themes that have  relevance to contemporary issues\u2014such as \u201caxis of evil,\u201d \u201ccommunal  responsibility,\u201d \u201cecological crisis,\u201d \u201cethics vs. religion,\u201d  \u201cgenocide,\u201d \u201choly war,\u201d \u201claw and ruler,\u201d \u201cthe Other,\u201d \u201creligious  intolerance,\u201d \u201csanctity of human life,\u201d and \u201csexual temptation and  moral obligation\u201d\u2014will be thoroughly scrutinized. Readings will cover  some key texts on the notion(s) of justice, readings from the Bible and  selected bibliographies for each of the biblical episodes. Students  will acquire tools to differentiate and hone their understanding of the  meaning of \u201cjustice\u201d and be challenged to reconsider, both critically  and creatively, their assumptions and apprehension of moral  responsibility, and ultimately, their own worldview and  self-understanding through a rereading of passages from the Bible. The  seminar will be taught at the Law School by law school methods  (\u201cSocratic\u201d interactive) and standards\u2014rigorous but academically and  intellectually rewarding. May be counted toward the major in Religious Studies or in Jewish History and Civilization.  J. H. H. Weiler   is University Professor and European Union Jean Monnet Chair at NYU Law  School. He serves as Director of The Straus Institute for the Advanced  Study of Law &amp; Justice and The Tikvah Center for Law and Jewish  Civilization. He was previously Professor of Law at the Michigan Law  School and then the Manley Hudson Professor of Law and the Jean Monnet  Chair at the Harvard Law School. He is a Fellow of the American Academy  of Arts and Sciences. He is the Editor-in-Chief of The European Journal of International Law . His recent publications include Un Europa Cristiana (translated into nine languages), The Constitution of Europe (translated into seven languages), and a novella, Der Fall Steinmann . Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach (V28.0156; call # 75320) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday: 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. Humans  are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that  others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by  justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this  phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist  systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of  justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in  the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains  an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s  nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one  can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally  sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any  subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence,  except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge  the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling  attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of  this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding. William Klein   teaches social foundations in NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies Program. In the  College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse  Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to  NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught  the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics,  from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under  a pen name) modern crime. Don Quixote (V28.0157; call # 75428) Instructor: Georgina Dopico Black Wednesday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. This seminar explores the privileged position of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019s Don Quixote   as first modern novel while also attending to the historical and  literary contexts from which it emerged. On one hand, our close reading  of Don Quixote considers how it is a work of recycling and crisis that  incorporates, parodies, and transforms all previous literary \u2014and many  non-literary\u2014 discourses to invent a new narrative form that does not  subscribe to any single poetics. On the other hand, this seminar  attempts to contextualize Cervantes\u2019s work within its historical  moment. To this end we consider some of the most important social,  political, economic, religious and cultural debates and institutions of  Renaissance Europe including Inquisition, imperial expansion, and  political and economic decline. We also explore questions of madness,  erotic and literary desire, authorship, subjectivity, the seductions  and the dangers of reading, the status of representation, translation,  literal vision versus literary visions, the workings of gender, race,  class and nation, and the tenuous frontiers between fiction and  history. The seminar is conducted in  English. Students may read the text in English (using Edith Grossman\u2019s  acclaimed translation) or in the original Spanish. May be counted  toward the major in Spanish or in Medieval and Renaissance Studies.  Georgina Dopico Black is Associate Professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and Editor of the Journal of Spanish Cultural Studies. She is the author of Perfect Wives, Other Women: Adultery and Inquisition in Early Modern Spain (2001), winner of the MLA\u2019s Katherine Singer Kovacs Prize and of Yale\u2019s Heyman Award. She has co-edited Suplemento al Tesoro de la lengua espa\u00f1ola de Sebasti\u00e1n de Covarrubias (2001), as well as two books on Cervantes: En un lugar de la Mancha (1999) and USA Cervantes (2008). Her current projects include one book on Don Quixote, another  on bodies and methods of truth production in the early modern period,  and a cultural history of medieval and Renaissance Spain. She has also  published articles on the morisco expulsion, the first Spanish  dictionary, Renaissance libraries, Inquisitorial torture, prostitution,  relics, and questions of national definition. The New York Dance Scene: Performance and Criticism Today (V28.0158; call # 75427) Instructor: Jennifer Homans Wednesday, 3:30\u20136:00 p.m. This  course offers a tour of today\u2019s dance scene in New York. We attend and  discuss performances ranging from classical ballet to \u201ccutting edge\u201d  contemporary dance. But seeing is only the beginning. Students also  study the historical roots of each performance we attend and read about  the artists involved (dancers and choreographers but also musicians and  designers). We evaluate each performance critically and historically,  and situate it within the larger cultural debates of our time. We study  classical ballet in its traditional and contemporary forms through  performances by New York City Ballet and Armitage Gone! Our examination  of the current state of American modern dance takes us to performances  at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Dance Theater Workshop, and the  Baryshnikov Arts Center, among others. Students attend performances  every other week; the interim week is devoted to discussion and  analysis. In preparation for class, students read historical  background, biographies, and criticism, and each student prepares an  in-class presentation relating to the performances we attend. In  consultation with the instructor, students also select a topic or  artist for a final extended essay. Jennifer Homans is the dance critic for the New Republic   and a Distinguished Scholar in Residence at New York University. She  holds a Ph.D. in Modern European History, and her forthcoming book, Classical Ballet: A New History ,  is a cultural history that follows ballet from its origins in  17th-century France to the present. Her articles have also appeared in  the New York Times and the New York Review of Books.   In her previous career, she was a professional dancer, trained in  ballet, modern, and jazz techniques. She performed with the Chicago  Lyric Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet  and has danced a wide repertory, ranging from the ballet classics to  works by George Balanchine, Jerome Robbins, and other contemporary  choreographers. The Pastness of the Present: Exploring \u201cHistorically Informed Performance\u201d and \u201cHistorically Involved Composition\u201d (V28.0159; call # 75642) Instructor: Elizabeth Hoffman Monday and Wednesday, 12:30\u20131:45 p.m. How  have performers of notated Western musics resolved the interpretive  dilemmas that result from performing musics which arose amidst distant  historical conditions and traditions? Tracing 19th- and 20th-century  answers to this question, students will explore the historically  informed performance movement in music studies. Concurrently, we will  consider what this movement\u2019s hypotheses and ethics might reveal if  used as a framework for viewing composers\u2019 confrontations with past  style practices. The ultimate goal of the course is to give students a  new set of questions with which to interrogate musical culture in the  21st century, and an intellectual framework with which to formulate  their own responses and experience. Case studies will be drawn from the  baroque period and the 19th and 20th centuries, and will include  selected examples of recent popular musics. The course should be of  interest to students majoring in music, history, philosophy, and other  disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. There are no prerequisites for this course. Ability to read music is strongly suggested, but is not required. Elizabeth Hoffman,   Associate Professor of Music, is the recipient of a Golden Dozen  Teaching Award. Her research interests include theories of tuning;  timbrally and texturally driven media forms; rhythmic complexity;  theories of notation and interpretation; aesthetics; the impact of  technology on creative thought; and the involvement of women in the  field of music composition. In addition to acoustic music, she composes  electroacoustic music, including works for stereo and multi-channel  sound, instrument and computer generated sound, and live  electroacoustic music. Her work has been recognized by artists grants  from the Seattle Arts Commission, a Bourges Residence Prize, and a Prix  Ars Electronica mention.                        Welcome!

A hands-on course in which students  learn how to program computers to simulate physical and biological  processes. The course meets alternately in classroom and computer  laboratory settings. The techniques needed to perform such  simulations are taught in class and then applied in the laboratory by  the students themselves, who work individually or in teams on  computing projects and report on these projects to the group as a  whole. Students learn how to make the computer generate graphics,  movies, and sounds as needed for presentation of the results of the  different simulations. Examples emphasized in class include the  orbits of planets, moons, comets, and spacecraft; the spread of  diseases in a population; the production of sound by musical  instruments; and the electrical activity of nerves. Students may draw  their projects from this list or choose other projects according to  individual interests.          Language and Reality in 20th-Century  Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Ulfers. 4 points. Explores the possibility that a common  ground exists between the so-called two cultures of science and the  humanities. It posits the hypothesis of a correlation between  postclassical science (for example, quantum theory) and postmodern  literature and philosophy. Among the key notions examined are  Heisenberg\u2019s \u201cuncertainty principle\u201d and the \u201cundecidability\u201d  of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions, and their  implications in literary works, revolves around their effect on  classical logic, the referential function of language, and the  traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality.  Readings include selections from the works of Borges, Kundera,  Pirsig, and Pynchon, as well as from nontechnical texts on quantum  and chaos theories.          The Supreme Court and the Religion  Clauses: Religion and State in America FRSEM-UA 218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the Native American  church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a  public high school invite a rabbi to give a benediction and  convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or  her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of  capital punishment or abortion? This course divides these questions  into three subject areas: religious liberty, separation of church and  state, and the role of religion in public and political life. It  focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more  important, invites students to construct a new vision of the proper  relationship among religion, state, and society in a 21st-century  liberal constitutional democracy.          First Amendment Freedom of Expression FRSEM-UA 235 Solomon. 4 points. Conflicts over freedom of speech erupt  into public debate almost every week. Congress passes a law to purge  indecency from online communications. A tobacco company sues a major  television network for libel. Press disclosures threaten the  fair-trial rights of defendants in the Oklahoma City bombing trial.  Although the First Amendment appears on its face to prohibit any  governmental restrictions on speech, the Supreme Court in fact  balances free and open expression against other vital interests of  society. This course begins by examining the struggle against  seditious libel (the crime of criticizing government or its  officials) that was not won in this country until the landmark  decision in New York Times v. Sullivan in 1964. Students examine  freedom of speech through the prism of a rich variety of contemporary  conflicts, including political dissent that advocates overthrow of  the government, prior restraints against publication, flag burning,  obscenity and pornography, the new law that bans indecency from  online services, hate speech, and inflictions of emotional distress.  Students read and analyze important decisions of the U.S. Supreme  Court.          From the Rise of Christianity to  Bowling Alone: A Sociological Perspective on Two Millennia FRSEM-UA 282 Lehman. 4 points. The second decade of the new millennium  has dawned with intensifying ideological cleavages in the United  States and assertions that we are increasingly a nation of isolated  individualists whose disregard for collective responsibilities is  eroding civic virtues and democratic institutions. Our seminar\u2019s  aim is to assess these diagnoses using Amitai Etzioni\u2019s The New  Golden Rule as a theoretical template and relying on such analytical  dimensions as autonomy versus order and freedom versus determinism.  We first situate American society in the broader context of decisive  moral and social transformations that have occurred in Western  civilization over the last two thousand years. To that end, our  seminar looks at Rodney Stark\u2019s acclaimed The Rise of Christianity,  which focuses on formative developments during the first four  centuries of the first millennium of the common era, and Max Weber\u2019s  classic, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. We then  examine social-science analyses of the contemporary American  situation, with the help of such books as Habits of the Heart by  Robert Bellah and his colleagues. Our final readings are Robert  Putnam\u2019s controversial Bowling Alone, which remains the most  publicized critique of contemporary American civic life, and Claude  S. Fischer\u2019s recent Made in America, which paints a much more  upbeat picture of what is happening around us.          The Crusades and Their Legacy FRSEM-UA 296 Claster. 4 points. In the history of the interactions  among Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, the Crusades, which began at  the end of the 11th century, form one of the most important chapters,  if not the most important chapter. The Crusades began as religious  wars to recover the holy places venerated by Christians in the city  of Jerusalem. For 200 years, the Crusaders managed to hold on to  their possessions, losing more of them with every passing decade,  until at last the Muslims triumphed and the kingdom in the East was  lost to Western Christendom. This seminar covers the Crusades  themselves, but focuses on the relations among the three great  religions and how it came about that they all claim Jerusalem for  their own. We study the differences among the religions, as well as  their many similarities. Most of all, we address some of the problems  crucial to an understanding of the world we live in: the nature of a  holy war, the issue of whether the Crusades were the first  manifestation of European imperialism in the Middle East, and the  legacy of the crusading era. Readings include Muslim, Jewish, and  Christian writings of the era in translation, as well as secondary  works.          Latin America at the Start of the 21st  Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FRSEM-UA 306 Casta\u00f1eda. 4 points. Focuses on several aspects of Latin  America\u2019s problems in the past and their possible solutions today.  The seminar takes up such topics as the absence of orderly, peaceful,  and steady democratic rule during the first 160 or 170 years of  independence from colonial rule and the consolidation of  representative democracy today; the absence of economic growth during  the last 20 years and the possibility of a new economic takeoff  today; the widespread persistence of violence in Latin America and  the growing respect for human rights today; and the weakness of civil  society in Latin America in the past and the growing strength and  vigor of civil society today. For each topic, readings deal with its  political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and  present.            Documentary Theatre FRSEM-UA 351 Martin. 4 points. Explores the subject matter, history,  and theoretical discourses surrounding the global occurrence of  contemporary theatre of the real, also popularly known as documentary  theatre. By analyzing the content, structure, and dramatic devices of  a number of plays, we will look at the problems and possibilities of  the ways in which theatre that cites reality portrays a range of  human behavior from everyday life to important political events in  the attempt to create and recreate personal, political, and  historical realities. Documentary theatre both acknowledges a  positivist faith in empirical reality and underscores an  epistemological crisis in knowing truth. We read plays about the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict, terrorism, the Holocaust, racial  clashes, the deposition of Cardinal Law, Oscar Wilde, the murder of  Matthew Shepard, Lebanese suicide bombers, the open murder of demonstrators in Greensboro, the  cover-up of industrial accidents in Poland, honor killings in  Holland, and accompanying theoretical essays, as well as look at some  performances on video. The questions we will consider include: Can  theatre effectively critique social and moral values? What are the  implications of the blurring of art and life? Are fiction and  nonfiction adequate terms for considering the idea of truth? How  might we consider theatre of the real from the vantage point of the  contemporary collapse of the distinction between the real, the  simulated, and the virtual?          Literary Theory and Its Applications FRSEM-UA 355 Maynard. 4 points. Students in this seminar read a  selection of essays from major thinkers about literature, mainly from  the latter half of the 20th century, to learn to consider different  approaches to literature. They complete the course by preparing a  discussion of a work of literature using one or more of the  conceptual approaches they have studied. Emphasis is placed on  learning how to analyze theoretical problems and improvise in  applying them to new situations. Recommended for students interested  in any area of the humanities.    Welcome to College: The Novel FRSEM-UA 371 Sternhell. 4 points. Starting college can be  exhilarating\u2014and terrifying. A chance for intellectual  enlightenment\u2014or intense loneliness. An escape from a stultifying  small town of narrow-minded people\u2014or a riot of alcohol, sex, and  drugs. In this course, we read a selection of college novels from  different historical periods, ranging from F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s  This Side of Paradise (about life at Princeton just before World War  I) to Tom Wolfe\u2019s recent bestseller I Am Charlotte Simmons (about  the corruption of a brilliant and innocent country girl at a  contemporary Ivy university). We discuss these novels from a variety  of perspectives: literary, historical, and journalistic. In addition  to presenting biographical and historical/cultural reports on at  least two of the authors and their novels, students write about their  own experiences as first-year students at NYU in several genres,  including fiction and nonfiction. Together, we explore this important  life passage, examining life as we live it.          Lethal Passions: Medea and Her Legacies FRSEM-UA 377 Theodoratou. 4 points. The mythic figure of Medea has held our  imagination for nearly 2,500 years. What kind of woman is capable of  casting such an enduring spell? Best known as the partner of Jason  and the murderer of her own children, Medea has been the name of an  exploration into the passion and violence, the devastation and  vengeance, the complex relations and modes of betrayal that so often  punctuate our everyday existence. She has demanded that we think  about the relations between the sexes, the meaning of home and exile,  the experience of the foreigner, the ethical and moral dimensions of  agency and decisions, and the meaning of motherhood. Because these  issues have remained vital, her popularity has outlived the ancient  Greek texts in which she was born and has found new expressions in  various forms\u2014including tragic drama, poetry, novels, painting,  cinema, and music. This course seeks to understand the reasons for  her longevity in the rich complexity of her character and actions and  to explore the ways in which her story has been revised and  recontextualized across the ages for new and different ends. We will  consider a range of texts from antiquity to the present to think  about how they understand the tensions, contradictions, and  conflicting desires embodied and enacted in this mesmerizing figure.          Computational Thought FRSEM-UA 385 Prerequisite: AP  calculus, discrete mathematics, or some programming experience.  Shasha. 4 points. Computational technology and methods  lie at the core of modern science, commerce, entertainment, and,  regrettably, war. Very powerful ideas underlie the field, with roots  in mathematics, linguistics, engineering, and even philosophy. Some  of its greatest inventions were born in caf\u00e9s or as responses to a  puzzle. Some recent algorithmic methods come from studying ants and  evolution. This course introduces computational thinking as it builds  on logic, linguistics, heuristics, artificial intelligence, and  biological computing. The learning style combines straight lecture,  interactive discussions of puzzles and games, and short computer  programs (in the programming language Python). Students make a few  presentations during the semester about topics such as the solutions  to computationally motivated puzzles, the relative power of  linguistic descriptions, and their very own simulations of a Rogerian  psychiatrist. The goal is for students to learn to think about  computation from multiple perspectives and to synthesize those  perspectives when faced with unsolved challenges.          Comfort and Suffering FRSEM-UA 393 Fulmer. 4 points. The purpose of this seminar is to  explore the nature of comfort and suffering as a human experience. We  examine related readings through the lens of the health care system  paradigm and use case studies to explore the wellness-illness  continuum of human experiences. Students become familiar with  conceptual frameworks used by nurses, physicians, and social workers  as they assist patients through the illness experience, which is  continually balanced between comfort and suffering. Our discussions  on the nature of comfort and suffering focus on writings from the  Bible, which are contrasted with contemporary editorials and  publications, in order to examine historical changes in the way  individuals think about these important dimensions of the human  experience. Scientific advances create heretofore unimaginable  opportunities, choices, and dilemmas for all of us as we seek to  discern how to cope with disease, human suffering, and the  psychological consequences that are inevitable when illness and care  needs create complexity in our lives. We debate the notion of  \u201cself-care,\u201d now very popular in the health care literature, and  contrast it with the concept of \u201cpatient abandonment.\u201d          Thirteen Masterworks of 20th-Century  Classical Music FRSEM-UA 397 Boorman. 4 points. The last hundred years have seen  radical changes in classical music, not only in the sound world but  also in aesthetic and technique\u2014ranging from the breakdown of  tonality and the use of electronic and computer resources in  performance to questions of the relationship of composer and  performer, of the place of noise, and even of what music is or could  be. This course presents outstanding works by a range of composers  (among them, Stravinsky, Carter, and Messiaen) both because of their  importance and as illustrations of ideas about music. Each  composition is explored for itself and also as a stimulus to  discussion about one or more of these issues. Each composition is one  that has stood the test of time and been hailed as a major work\u2014and  those criteria also need discussion. The course involves considerable  listening alongside readings. It requires a willingness to reassess  conventional views about music and to accept unconventional  solutions.        Alexis de Tocqueville FRSEM-UA 398 Berman. 4 points. Alexis de Tocqueville published  Democracy in America in two volumes, in 1835 and 1840. Those volumes  have come to be widely regarded as a masterpiece twice over, the most  incisive portrait of the American national character ever written,  and a profound reflection on the meaning of democracy itself.  Democracy in America is also a beautiful work of literature. This  seminar studies Democracy in America in depth. It looks at some of  Tocqueville\u2019s writings on his own country, France, and glances  briefly at his predecessor and kinsman, Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand, who  visited America in the 1790s. By reading and discussing Tocqueville  and Chateaubriand, students sharpen their ability to think  philosophically about democracy, America, France, and other themes  and increase their ability to recognize and appreciate the art of  good writing.          The Meanings of Photography FRSEM-UA 400 Baer. 4 points. We live in an illustrated world, and  photographs have come to determine political, personal, and even the  most private of decisions. Who is guilty and who is exonerated? Who  gets elected and who loses the vote? Whom do you like, will you get  to know, or want to be with? Whom you remember and whom will you  forget depend on how someone or something has been presented in a  photograph. To navigate this maze of images takes special skills.  Nowhere more powerfully than in photographs have the lines between  reality and fiction, truth and lie, been blurred. There is great  danger in this development and immense potential to free ourselves  from existing constraints, too. This interdisciplinary seminar  explores how photographic images create meaning and how they help us  make the worlds we live in. Particular attention is paid to the way  photography marks the often invisible difference between someone\u2019s  private world and the world at large. We read major theoretical texts  on photography, watch films where photographs play a decisive role,  and look at a wide range of photographs from the inception of the  medium to the current moment to test theories of photography against  the medium\u2019s uncanny and unrivaled power to evoke the real. Be  prepared to look closely and to think hard. Readings include texts by  Siegfried Kracauer, Walter Benjamin, Vladimir Rodchenko, Andr\u00e9  Bazin, Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag, Geoffrey Batchen, Allan Sekula,  Vil\u00e9m Flusser, and Mario Vargas Llosa, as well as images by a  plethora of artists, professionals, and amateurs from around the  globe.          Guitar Heroes (and Heroines): Music,  Video Games, and the Nature of Human Cognition FRSEM-UA 427 Marcus. 4 points. A look at music and video games from  the perspective of cognitive and evolutionary psychology. Among the  questions we consider: Why are human beings so passionate about music  and so easily sucked in by video games? Is our love of music the  product of natural selection? Can science tell us anything about what  works in music and what doesn\u2019t? What is the relationship between  music and language? Is there a \u201cuniversal grammar\u201d for music?  Will machines ever be able to create satisfying works of music? The  primary focus is on the psychology of music, with video games serving  as counterpoint. Readings are drawn from a broad range of  disciplines, including psychology, linguistics, evolutionary biology,  artificial intelligence, and neuroscience. Written assignments  include weekly reaction papers and a final paper proposing a novel  experiment.    COLLEGIATE SEMINARS        The Cultural Nature of Language COSEM-UA 101 Schieffelin. 4 points. From accents and pronouns to swearing  and spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. We examine  language use as a social practice and analyze how speakers and their  language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts  and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don\u2019t  (for example, feral children), we examine speech and silence across a  range of societies. We also look at popular attitudes toward language  and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (for  example, political correctness), in legal and educational  institutions (such as \u201cEnglish only\u201d), and in multilingual cities  (such as Barcelona and Montreal) to understand how ideas about  language are often recruited to nonlinguistic concerns, such as who  should be included or excluded. In thinking about the cultural nature  of language in this way, we critically explore issues of identity and  authority.          Terrorism, Nihilism, and Modernity COSEM-UA 102 Gilligan. 4 points. The past century has witnessed violence  the character and scale of which are so unique and unprecedented that  we have had to create a new vocabulary to describe it (genocide,  terrorism) and the ideologies that underlie it (totalitarianism,  fundamentalism). To understand modern violence, we examine the origin  of the modern mind in the 17th century, when science, based on  universal doubt, ended the Age of Faith, and the traditional sources  of moral, legal, and political authority lost credibility. Nietzsche  called this the \u201cdeath of God\u201d (and the Devil); it could also be  called the death of Good and Evil, leading to another set of new  words (nihilism, agnosticism, anomie, anarchy). We study the origins  and implications of these developments by reading Shakespeare and  John Donne, Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky, Beckett and Wittgenstein,  Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt, as well as modern mass murderers from  Hitler to bin Laden. Finally, we ask whether modern human sciences  can help us understand how to reverse or at least limit this  escalation of violence.          In Search of Lost Time COSEM-UA 104 Clements. 4 points. We read Proust (in translation) as he  should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also  with delectation. A prodigious novel, 4,500 pages long, In Search of  Lost Time addresses literature\u2019s richest theme: desire\u2014its  remembrance, transformation, perversion, defeat, and final resurgence  in the form of art. More than 100 years old, often said to be the  first modern novel, it remains a dazzling portrait of the French beau  monde and, even more, of the power and elegance of its author\u2019s  sensibility. It is still unparalleled in how it combines  self-examination with social history, extraordinary psychological  acuity with the study of glamour and decadence, and how it merges an  audacious explosion of form with explorations of memory, attachment,  deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, disappointment, and ennui. It is  also one of the most pleasurable and elating reads. Although Marcel  Proust (1871\u20131922) is usually assumed to be France\u2019s greatest  novelist, his prose is so layered and brilliant that, unfortunately,  many readers begin at the beginning and never move past the first 50  pages, reading the same gorgeous sentences again and again. While In  Search of Lost Time\u2019s prose style (playing on association,  evocation, magnification, punning, rhythm) may have been its most  radical contribution to the art of the novel, it cannot be understood  until it has been read once in its entirety. In this seminar, we keep  moving at a brisk pace through the work, merely glancing at its  riches on our way, until we arrive at the uniquely euphoric  experience of reading the final volume, Time Regained. Required  reading: an average of 350 pages per week.          American Wars, Past and Present:  Vietnam, Iraq (I and II), Afghanistan COSEM-UA 106 Young. 4 points. Considers the last two major wars of  the 20th century and the first two of the 21st century. The seminar  begins with the history, memory, and subsequent political uses of the  Vietnam War. We then move on to examine the Gulf War I (Operation  Desert Storm), which was shaped by the way the administration of  President George H. W. Bush understood the Vietnam War. The  subsequent war in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) can be understood in  part in terms of what some policymakers believed to be the unfinished  business of Gulf War I. Yet it too was fought in the shadow of  Vietnam analogies. Finally, the war in Afghanistan, launched in  response to 9/11, in terms of tactics and goals, has been shaped by  all three of the preceding wars. We examine these wars through  primary documents and secondary sources, as well as the abundance of  documentary and fiction film in which they have all been represented.  The overarching concern of the seminar is the ongoing haunting of  American politics\u2014military and civilian\u2014by a war fought over  three decades ago. There are two connected questions: Can history  teach? What does it teach?          Zoo\u00ebsis: Animal Acts for Changing  Times COSEM-UA 107 Chaudhuri. 4 points. The emerging field of animal studies  has already generated neologisms in various disciplines:  \u201canthrozoology\u201d (culture studies), \u201czoopolis\u201d (urban social  theory), and \u201czoontology\u201d (philosophy). To these the fields of  literature and performance studies propose an addition, \u201czoo\u00ebsis,\u201d  to refer to the history of animal representation that stretches, in  the Western literary tradition, from Aesop\u2019s Fables to Will Self\u2019s  Great Apes; in the Western dramatic tradition, from Aristophanes\u2019  The Frogs to Albee\u2019s The Goat; in film, from Muybridge\u2019s  \u201czoogyroscope\u201d to Herzog\u2019s Grizzly Man; in popular culture,  from Mickey Mouse to Animal Planet; and in popular performance, from  gladiatorial contests to Siegfried and Roy. To speak of zoo\u00ebsis is  also to acknowledge the manifold performances engendered by cultural  animal practices such as dog shows, keeping pets, equitation, rodeo,  bullfighting, animal sacrifice, scientific experimentation,  taxidermy, hunting, wearing fur, eating meat\u2014each with its own  archive and repertory, its own performers and spectators. We study  recent films, novels, plays, and cultural events that reveal how our  interaction with animals shapes our understanding of the human, our  approach to the \u201cOther\u201d (including the racial and ethnic  \u201cOther\u201d), and our attitude toward the world.          Matter, Dark Matter, and Dark Energy COSEM-UA 108 Farrar. 4 points. The past several decades have seen  tremendous advances in observational cosmology. As a result, we  understand in remarkable detail many aspects of the evolution and  contents of the universe. This course focuses on three of the most  puzzling facts about the universe: Why was there a slight excess of  matter over antimatter after the Big Bang? (Otherwise, after  matter-antimatter annihilation was complete, no matter would have  been left.) What is dark matter? (Although on average in the universe  it is five times more abundant than normal matter, we know that it is  something not found on earth or, so far, observed in our  laboratories.) What is so-called \u201cdark energy\u201d? (The expansion  rate of the universe is actually accelerating, rather than slowing  down as was expected, a finding attributed to this new component of  the universe.) Students enrolling in the seminar should have taken AP  Physics, be enrolled in Physics I (PHYS-UA 91), or have permission of  the instructor.          How We See COSEM-UA 109 Carrasco. 4 points. Do we see the world the way we do  because we are the way we are or because the world is the way it is?  The ease with which we comprehend the visual world and recognize  objects and events makes it tempting to think that the world is just  the way we see it and to take our perceptual capabilities for  granted. But when we comprehend that we cannot process all the  information available in the environment, when we try to build  machines that can see, or when we encounter people who have lost some  specific visual capability\u2014for example, those who can no longer  recognize faces\u2014we realize how extraordinary and intricate are the  machinery and mechanisms of sight. This course looks at what we know  about vision from multiple scientific perspectives. Perceptual  psychology tells us about the process of seeing and provides  important insights into the workings of visual mechanisms;  neuropsychology shows us what happens to perception when these  mechanisms malfunction; and neuroscience tells us about processes at  the level of cells and neural systems. At the same time, we discuss  modes and techniques of scientific inquiry from these different  perspectives. How do vision scientists learn? What kinds of  experiments do they conduct? How has the development of new  neuroimaging techniques (fMRI, for example) shaped the field?          Great Science, Fabulous Science, and  Voodoo Science COSEM-UA 111 Mincer. 4 points. Science is often portrayed as following  a very clearly defined set of procedures: start with a hypothesis, do  an experiment, and, based on the results, reject the hypothesis or  adopt it as a working assumption. The actual process, however, is  rarely so straightforward. In addition, the stories as usually told  or recorded may differ from what really happened. We study some  famous and infamous experiments, mainly in the physical sciences,  selected to illustrate intellectual tours de force, cases of error,  cases of fraud, and the murky boundaries between them. Along the way,  issues such as the discarding of \u201cfaulty data,\u201d theoretical bias,  and probabilistic tools for hypothesis acceptance and rejection are  discussed. To take this course, students should have had high school  chemistry, physics, and calculus.          Finding New York City COSEM-UA 114 Serrin. 4 points. In this seminar, students explore,  read, and write about\u2014and develop a deep understanding of\u2014New  York City from diverse perspectives and by means of various media. We  venture into different neighborhoods, ethnic areas, all five  boroughs, out on the Hudson and East rivers, restaurants, parks, and  the like. We examine New York history and how the city has changed  over the decades, writing several pieces on what we see and read and  what people tell us. In the end, all should have an understanding of  how New York City began, how it has changed over time, what remains  from the old days, what new things are happening, and what the future  might be. This is, in short, a course in urban America that takes New  York City as its laboratory. The seminar turns to reading the  splendid books or sections from the splendid books that deal with  important aspects of the history and life of New York City, among  them The Island at the Center of the World; Divided Loyalties;  Forgotten Patriots; The Devil\u2019s Own Work: The Civil War Draft Riots  and the Fight to Reconstruct America; Five Points; Positively 4th  Street; and A Freewheelin\u2019 Time: A Memoir of Greenwich Village in  the Sixties. It also considers how the image of New York City in the  movies has changed over the decades, drawing in part on the book  Celluloid Skyline. In addition, it uses parts of the Ken Burns\u2019s  PBS documentary series New York City.          Russia\u2019s Multicultural Empire COSEM-UA 116 Burbank. 4 points. From the 16th century to the present, \u201cRussia\u201d has been an empire\u2014a state that spread its power over different peoples, with different religious commitments, different laws and customs, and different histories. Even after the quite peaceful breakup of the USSR, the Russian Federation is the largest country in the world, and still a multi-ethnic state. What held the vast territories and populations, ruled by tsars, and later communists, together? Why has Russia not disintegrated or been torn apart by multiple wars among its many ethnic groups since 1991? This seminar will explore these questions through readings, discussions, and research. We will examine how Russian leaders ruled their many populations and how people living on the terrain of a succession of Russian empires\u2014the Grand Princedom of Muscovy, imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Federation\u2014have imagined their relations with each other and with these states. Our sources include historians\u2019 studies, literature, and documents of many types: games, maps, laws, and films. Each student will write a research paper concerning a particular imperial situation, and we work together to understand the origins, habits, and effects of Russia\u2019s empires of difference.          Impossible Writing COSEM-UA 118 Foer. 4 points. As with any art, literature\u2019s form  determines what is possible. In this course, we challenge the  boundaries of the form through a series of \u201cimpossible\u201d  exercises\u2014that is, pieces of writing that are asked to do what  writing cannot do. For example, one assignment challenges  literature\u2019s unique portability by generating \u201csite-specific\u201d  stories around campus. Another assignment focuses on the lack of  explicit tonality and atmosphere in writing by generating oral  stories. In our discussions about the work produced, we explore the  ways that these radical techniques can be brought into more  traditional writing. The course focuses on the production of work,  and students are expected to produce a piece of writing every week,  usually between two paragraphs and four pages.          Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War  and U.S. Culture COSEM-UA 119 Fern\u00e1ndez. 4 points The Great Depression. Liberal democracy  in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of ideologies ranging from  anarchism to fascism, offering solutions to the afflictions of people  all over the planet. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts  to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government.  All eyes turn toward Spain. This seminar is centered on NYU\u2019s  Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of  materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who,  between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. We  explore the place occupied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in  American culture from the 1930s forward; how journalists, writers,  artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain; and how the legacy  of the war has affected U.S. culture over the last 70 years. Each  student completes a major research project based on the holdings of  ALBA.          Utopia and Apocalypse COSEM-UA 120 Borenstein. 4 points. The utopian impulse is the drive to  create the perfect world; the apocalypse is the global cataclysm that  is often considered utopia\u2019s prerequisite. In this seminar, we  examine the development of the utopian tradition, as both literary  genre and philosophical thought experiment. Among the questions to be  considered: What is the relationship between utopia and the novel?  How do we get from \u201chere\u201d (the imperfect world) to \u201cthere\u201d  (the perfect one), and how is this journey enacted in fiction? Why  are the family, gender, and sexuality so central to the utopian  tradition? What is the utopian conception of pleasure? Utopia is  often seen as the culmination of historical progress, the goal toward  which humanity has been striving. Later utopian (and anti-utopian)  fictions often place their \u201cperfect\u201d societies in a  post-apocalyptic framework, adding particular moral and temporal  dimensions to utopia: not only does utopia become the endpoint of  history, but the perfection of the coming world can be invoked to  justify the cataclysm that precedes it. Course materials consist of  fiction, scripture, philosophy, film, and graphic novels, including  the works of Bacon, Campanella, Dostoevsky, LeGuin, Marx and Engels,  More, Moore and Gibbons, and Plato.          Moral Dilemmas of Work and Care in the  21st Century COSEM-UA 121 Gerson. 4 points. Modern societies have long sought to  reconcile the conflict between self-development and caring for others  by dividing women and men into different moral categories. Structural  arrangements (such as the separation of home and work) and cultural  pressures (such as the norms of intensive motherhood and  good-providing fatherhood) expect women to find personal fulfillment  in caring for others and men to care for others by sharing the  rewards of their independent pursuits. Yet the rise of fluid families  and post-industrial workplaces has severely undermined this gender  division of \u201cmoral labor.\u201d As women take on increasing economic  responsibilities and men face a dwindling pool of stable jobs, rigid  moral categories have given way to new moral dilemmas. In crafting an  identity, how do women and men balance work commitments with a  personal life? In forming adult relationships, how do they weigh the  need for autonomy with the desire for enduring commitment? In caring  for children, how do they trade off earning a living with family  time? This course examines the link between blurring gender  boundaries and the rise of new moral dilemmas of work and care. We  examine the institutional roots of these dilemmas, explore the new  strategies people are developing to resolve them, and consider the  social and political consequences of these revolutionary shifts.          Exploring the Mysteries of Behavior COSEM-UA 122 Kiorpes. 4 points. Did you ever wonder how whales navigate  flawlessly over thousands of miles? Why songbirds sing? This course  provides an in-depth look at a variety of organisms that have evolved  particular, special behavioral adaptations as solutions to  environmental challenges. Each neural system to be studied highlights  a unique combination of behavioral skill and environmental problem to  be solved. For example, echolocation in bats is a navigation device  and an adaptive hunting system that allows them to successfully hunt  on the wing; infrared sensing in snakes is an effective prey  localization and defense mechanism, enhancing their survival in the  absence of limbs. Students learn basic principles of sensory, motor,  and cognitive neuroscience and study the mechanisms underlying the  natural behavior of organisms. Students independently identify  unique, species-specific behavioral adaptations and explore the  neural mechanisms related to those adaptations. The resulting  investigation forms the basis for a term paper and an oral  presentation to the class. A high degree of student participation is  expected. A textbook as well as primary research articles will  comprise the readings. Students should have a strong background in  biology, animal behavior, or psychology.          The Mysteries of Paris: Detective  Fiction in France COSEM-UA 125 Miller. 4 points. While critics debate the origins of  detective fiction, no one questions the central place this literary  genre holds in contemporary arts production\u2014not only in novels but  also in television, computer games, and film. In France alone,  detective (or mystery) fiction accounts for 20 percent of all novels  purchased during the year. The French, in fact, have inflected the  genre in very particular ways: For example, thanks to the fascination  of the great 19th-century writers Balzac and Hugo with the real-life  police detective Vidocq, the \u201cambiguous and obsessed\u201d fictional  investigator has become a staple of both French and American  detective fiction. The Franco-American connection also inspired  author Edgar Allan Poe to situate his mysteries on Paris\u2019s Rue  Morgue. In turn, his stories prompted a major output of detective  fiction during France\u2019s Second Empire, many located in the \u201cCity  of Lights.\u201d From Gaston Leroux\u2019s and Eug\u00e8ne Sue\u2019s urban  thrillers of the late 19th century to Daniel Pennac\u2019s hilarious  multi-cultural adventures in Belleville, the hippest neighborhood of  the 21st century, Paris has thus become a site to be decoded and  observed, the crucible for questions basic to detective fiction the  world over: Why do people commit crimes? What are the consequences  for the individual and for society? What is the nature of evil? And  what kind of human being dedicates himself or herself to finding out  the answers? In this seminar, we analyze what constitutes a detective  or mystery novel (and discuss the potential differences between  \u201cdetective\u201d and \u201cmystery\u201d), trace the development of the  genre in France, and examine why it is that reading such works is so  compelling. We focus primarily on novels in which Paris plays a major  role, studying how the city has been used to give shape to the  underlying questions of the novel. We see, perhaps unsurprisingly,  that French-language detective fiction has been as involved in  imagining a mysterious Paris as in solving Paris\u2019s mysteries.          Consuming China, Past and Present COSEM-UA 127 Waley-Cohen. 4 points. Material culture and consumption in  China from imperial times to the present. This course explores some  of the ways in which commerce and consumerism have flourished in  China despite various potentially countervailing factors, including  Confucians\u2019 presumed aversion to trade, Buddhist and Daoist  renunciations of material things, wartime deprivations under the  Republic, rising egalitarianism, and Communist Party denunciations of  bourgeois ideals of consumption. We will investigate such aspects as  clothing and cosmetics; houses and gardens; art collecting and  connoisseurship; books and publishing; food and narcotics; opera and  theatre. While illuminating Chinese social and cultural life,  including aspects of continuity or change over several centuries, the  course also introduces students to theoretical concepts about  modernity\u2019s relationship to the world of goods and consumption, and  considers whether and to what extent those concepts, formulated in a  largely western context, may or may not be applicable to China.          Understanding 9/11 COSEM-UA 128 Gerety. 4 points. Examines the 9/11 attacks from an  interdisciplinary perspective, seeking to reach a better  understanding of the attack itself, the motivations and backgrounds  of the attackers, the failures in the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s  defenses\u2014and above all, the nature and scope of America\u2019s  response, at home and abroad. We read studies of terrorism and  counter-terrorism, including moral and legal arguments about torture,  detention, and targeted killings. We visit various sites in New York  City and meet with people with direct experience of the attack and  its aftermath, including representatives of both the police and the  immigrant communities who have suffered profiling and mistrust from  the suspicions aroused by the attack. Looking toward the future, we  examine local, national, and international strategies to prevent such  attacks and to halt the radicalization that brings fresh recruits to  terrorist movements.    ADVANCED HONORS SEMINARS          The History of Disbelief AHSEM-UA 113 Stephens. 4 points. Takes up an extended history of atheism  and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It begins in  Greece and then moves on to a brief discussion of anthropological  perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, to the Hebrews  and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the  Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the  romantic period. Time is spent in England and America in the 19th  century, when disbelief was being tied to radical politics, before  moving on to the connection between disbelief and realism, modernism  and postmodernism. The main arguments for and against the existence  of God are considered. However, the main purpose of this course is to  force students to confront and grapple with some of the most  sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors  read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky,  Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud.          Varieties of Religious Experience  Revisited AHSEM-UA 144 Gilligan. 4 points. Uses but also updates William James\u2019s  pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in  psychological rather than theological terms. Examines how the term  \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing than helpful when it fails to  differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs  and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional  development. Discusses the phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d  (nationalism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as  attempts to reject modernity (the modern scientific mentality), in  order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in  the soul of modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources  of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason)  lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. Considers that  political religions result from psychological regression and  contrasts them with the current moment in the evolution of religious  consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of  religious expression, understanding, and experience consistent with  the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it.  Concludes by examining whether this is the context in which the next  major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need  to occur.          The 14th Century\u2014When Europe Was  Transformed AHSEM-UA 147 Claster. 4 points. The century covered in this course saw  disasters of many kinds, some all too familiar to us in the 21st  century. It was the century of the Black Death and the decimation of  the population on an enormous and unprecedented scale; a time of an  economic recession that changed the pattern of prosperity that had  existed in the preceding two centuries; a time when the papacy and  the Roman Church were faced with the rise of heresy and challenges to  religious authority; a time of wars and of rebellions. Yet, in the  same era, there was a march forward\u2014toward new ideas, new political  forms, vernacular languages, a reawakening that brought changes of  immense consequence for all of Europe and for our own culture.  Through the darkest periods, the great and beautiful changes that are  the beginnings of the Italian Renaissance emerged. This was the age  of Petrarch and Boccaccio, among many others, and the great Italian  painters and writers who transformed the nature and conception of  literature and art and who informed our own worldview. Overall, we  study a century that many historians have understood as the most  creative and the most terrible of all the centuries until the 20th  century.          The Making of an Iconic Image AHSEM-UA 148 Cross-listed with  Photography and Imaging of the Tisch School of the Arts as PHTI-UT  1120. Willis. 4 points. Iconic images are pictures that become  rooted in our personal memory and are stored away for future  reference through our experiences with them. Often, the power of an  iconic image extends beyond the meaning of its original purpose and  takes on another form socially and historically. This seminar  explores the range of ideas and methods used by photographers,  artists, historians, filmmakers, and critical thinkers in addressing  the notion of iconic images within photography, video, and film. It  combines historical, contemporary, and theoretical approaches to  identity politics and visual culture, and addresses how images are  constructed through art, media, advertising, political campaigns, war  and disaster, beauty, and popular culture. Class discussions  highlight the trends and transformations that have characterized the  evolution of the iconic image. Using a series of case studies, we  explore the construction of beauty and style, gendered images, race,  and pop culture. We also consider issues of representation, display,  and reception, as well as the wider social context in which art,  music, and culture are experienced in private and public spaces. In  addition to classes held on campus, field trips are taken to  archives, museums, and galleries. Each week, students discuss a  photograph of their own choice.          Reading The Dream of the Red Chamber AHSEM-UA 149 Wang. 4 points. The Dream of the Red Chamber is an epic  literary classic produced by Cao Xueqin in the middle of the 18th  century. Following the traditional form of Chinese fiction, known as  \u201cthe chaptered novel,\u201d it covers a vast terrain of Chinese  culture and social life and is widely regarded as the culmination of  the vernacular novel of imperial China and a synthesis of Chinese  aesthetic and philosophical traditions. With the tragic love story  between two teenage members of an aristocratic clan in southern China  at its dramatic center, the novel intimately explores the questions  concerning what is eternal and what is ephemeral; love and affection,  or \u201cqing,\u201d as the heart of being that both animates and destroys  life; the nature of individual talent and its fragility; the excesses  and decadence of the privileged; as well as the growing, if hidden,  social and class tensions. Its manifold structure and intricate plot  development, coupled with its dazzling array of memorable characters,  make this novel the most complex and colorful of all times. Both  reading and discussions are conducted in English.          Transdisciplinary Investigations Across  Multiple Evolutionary Scales AHSEM-UA 154 Volk. 4 points. This TIMES seminar considers the most  basic patterns across the realms of nature and mind and searches for  common functional principles that create those patterns. The guiding  context is the fact that evolution is a form-generating process. In a  general sense, evolution occurs on multiple scales: biological  (Darwinian evolution), cultural (invention and social selection), and  cognition (learning and creativity). All these scales possess unique  but also similar subprocesses of replication, variation, and  selection. Therefore, where the functional advantages of certain  solutions are the same to the challenges of existence across the  realms, we should expect to find common patterns as those solutions.  (See the instructor\u2019s book and papers on \u201cmetapatterns\u201d for  more.) Students find this an exciting area of inquiry and enlarge  their intellectual horizons as they engage in research that becomes  more self-chosen during the course. Students from all disciplines are  encouraged to enroll.          Reconstructing World Violence: A  Hobbesian Approach AHSEM-UA 156 Klein. 4 points. Humans are as violent as any creature,  but we have something in abundance that others may lack: the ability  to sustain and glorify our violence by justifying it. After  attempting to develop coherent accounts of this phenomenon, students  consider ways in which pacifist systems of thought have interacted  with violent systems of justification, often but not always with  genocidal results. It was in the midst of such a violent crisis that  Hobbes initiated what remains an undeveloped approach. If one can  extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s nationalist agenda and redirect his  approach in a democratic way, one can arrive (as many have) at the  following claim: Only when globally sovereign conflict-resolving  institutions are fully authorized will any subordinate system  justifying violence lose its force and coherence, except in the case  of violent revolutionary movements that challenge the global  authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling attempts to  operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of this claim  not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its  implications or suspect its grounding.          Edmund Wilson and the Art of Cultural  Criticism AHSEM-UA 165 Cross-listed with  Journalism as JOUR-UA 401. Berman. 4 points. Edmund Wilson (1895\u20131972) was the  greatest cultural critic that America has ever produced\u2014or so a  good many cultural critics of our own time have come to believe.  Wilson belonged to a circle of writers from the First World War  generation that included John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and  Edna St. Vincent Millay. He wrote novels, poetry, plays, and diaries.  But mostly he wrote book reviews and essays on literary, political,  and historical topics, which ran in the New Republic, the New Yorker,  the New York Review of Books and other magazines. Reading a  substantial sampling of Wilson\u2019s work, we will examine a series of  large topics, including the cultural atmosphere of Greenwich Village  early in the 20th century; the rise of literary modernism; the  influence of Marxism; the literature of the Civil War; and various  traditions of American thought and literature over the centuries. We  will pay close attention to Wilson\u2019s style of journalistic writing:  his emphases on clarity, on conversational ease, and on emotional  forcefulness. Students will be asked to apply Wilson\u2019s principles  of writing to their own compositions\u2014an extremely useful thing to  do for any student who seeks to become a better writer.             Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in  20th-Century America AHSEM-UA 168 Cross-listed with History  as HIST-UA 664. Please note that this course does not satisfy the  advanced research seminar requirement for the history major. Nash. 4  points. Conflicts over racial equality, freedom  of speech, and equal protection under the law that were guaranteed in  the Constitution have been contested terrain throughout U.S. history.  These struggles sharpened in the 20th century as African Americans  fought to end racial segregation, women sought equal rights, business  interests resisted labor militancy, while federal and state  governments suppressed radicals and other dissenters. This seminar  examines the legal struggles and the social movements that took place  as Americans fought for civil rights and civil liberties during  periods of war, industrial unrest, and social change. It explores  these stories by analyzing legal history through the lenses of  political, social, and cultural history. This is an interdisciplinary  course. Students study novels, poems, and oral memoirs; view films;  and read historical monographs that speak to this big and important  subject. The Tamiment Library, one of the most important repositories  in the United States documenting the history of radical politics,  civil rights, and civil liberties, is our laboratory. Students work  with archives and other special collections on a weekly basis,  learning how to use and evaluate these primary sources, interpret  evidence, make analytical arguments, and develop research questions.             Commitment and Escape AHSEM-UA 171 Cross-listed with  Comparative Literature as COLIT-UA 181. Bishop. 4 points. The seventy-or-so years this seminar  examines were among the most turbulent in the history of the world.  They start with the butchery of World War II, the Shoah, and atomic  devastation, and end with the often violent birth of new nations  through the decolonization of African and Asian lands. But they were  also years of reconstruction and modernization, leading to booming  economies and social improvement. The rise of Arab nationalism and  Islamic fundamentalism and the emergence of China as the colossus of  the 21st century were among the signposts of a changing world in  which peoples demanded\u2014and won\u2014their freedom. Perhaps most  revolutionary, women at last attained freedom and equality in many  parts of the globe. Many writers and thinkers felt such concern for  the world around them that they were inevitably drawn to dealing with  contemporary issues. Others focused on broader, more philosophic  approaches to the existential problems of man in this world; others  still sought escape from commitment in artistic paths, removed from  social and political considerations. By working with texts\u2014novels,  essays, short stories, plays, and films\u2014that reflect artists\u2019 and  intellectuals\u2019 reactions to their times, we will explore and  analyze many of the leading creative voices of these turbulent years,  including, but not limited to: Arthur Miller, Albert Camus, Assia  Djebar, Samuel Beckett, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Betty Friedan, and James  Baldwin. The keynote to the seminar will come from Jean-Paul Sartre\u2019s  What Is Literature?          The Spanish Inquisition AHSEM-UA 173 Cross-listed with Spanish  as SPAN-UA 952. Black. 4 points. In contemporary media and in the wake  of 9/11, the Spanish Inquisition has been used as shorthand to denote  intolerance, persecution, fanaticism, and a disposition to cruelty in  the pursuit of \u201ctruth.\u201d While some elements of this reputation  are well-earned, the history of the Inquisition is far more complex  and interesting. We begin the semester with the heated question of  the origins of the Inquisition and its key role in nation building,  in order to then turn to the Inquisition\u2019s internal organization  and standard practices. From there, we consider the various targets  of inquisitorial suspicion or persecution from the late 15th through  late 17th centuries: Judaism and crypto-Judaism (the conversos),  Protestantism, prohibited books, mystics and Illuminati, witches,  Islam and crypto-Islam (the moriscos), and those accused of sexual or  religious misconduct (blasphemy, bigamy, and sodomy). We close the  semester considering what finally brought about the definitive  abolition of the Inquisition in 1834. We will read transcripts from  Inquisitorial trials, edicts and proclamations, historical  chronicles, novels, plays, autobiographies, an Inquisitor\u2019s manual  with instructions for torture, a witch-hunting treatise, and  devotional literature. We also will examine more contemporary  reflections: Dostoevsky\u2019s 1880 The Brothers Karamazov, Monty  Python\u2019s 1970 \u201cNobody expects the Spanish Inquisition\u201d skit,  and the film adaptation of J. K. Rowling\u2019s 2003 Harry Potter and  the Order of the Phoenix.

One way the College has done so is through its Seminar program, which gives students the opportunity to participate in small, intellectually stimulating classes on important topics taught by distinguished professors drawn not only from the College\u2019s faculty but also from NYU\u2019s professional schools and from among New York\u2019s professional, cultural, and governmental leaders. In spring 2005, the College of Arts and Science launched the Advanced Honors Seminar program, which extends the basic principles behind the very successful Freshman Honors Seminars, offered since 1992, to upper-level courses. These small classes are taught by faculty from across the University and from the wider New York community. In some instances students may count the classes toward their major or minor, if the departments consider this appropriate; other classes will count simply as electives. Advanced Honors Seminars have as their goals to put undergraduates into contact with leading thinkers, to introduce them to important subjects, to challenge them intellectually through demanding standards of analysis and oral and written argumentation, and to prepare them to conduct their own research. In sum, these courses are meant to foster an environment in which learning is an exciting experience for students and faculty alike. - Dean Matthew S. Santirocco COURSE DESCRIPTIONS  The History of Disbelief (V28.0113; call # 75084) Instructor: Mitchell Stephens Thursday, 12:30\u20133:00 p.m. This seminar will take up an extended history of atheism and doubt (in the context of a history of religion). It will begin in Greece and then move on to a brief discussion of anthropological perspectives on belief, before returning to Greece, to the Hebrews and Rome, to India and Baghdad, and then back to Europe during the Renaissance, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, and the Romantic period.

The main arguments for and against the existence of God will be considered. However, the main purpose of this course will be to force students to confront and grapple with some of the most sophisticated and profound human expressions of disbelief. Authors whose works will be read may include Cicero, Hume, Holbach, Paine, Shelley, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Woolf, and Freud, among others. Mitchell Stephens is Professor of Journalism and Mass Communication. He is the author of, among other books, The Rise of the Image the Fall of the Word and A History of News . Articles by him on media issues, philosophy, anthropology, physics, and other subjects have appeared in the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Los Angeles Times , FEED , and other publications. He has recorded radio commentaries for Marketplace and On the Media .  Past and Present in Irish Archaeology (V28.0134; call # 75085) Instructor: Pam Crabtree Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. Ireland has a rich archaeological heritage that includes hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic Period, Megalithic tombs at Knowth and Newgrange, the Hill of Tara, early Christian monasteries such as Clonmacnoise, and the Viking settlements in Dublin itself. This course will consider how the Irish past has been constructed and what role that this construction of the Irish past has played in the modern world. We will review the archaeology of Ireland from its initial settlement in the Mesolithic through the British colonization of Northern Ireland in the early Modern Era. The course will also examine the impact of rapid economic development on Ireland\u2019s archaeological resources, including the current debate surrounding the site of Tara. Pam Crabtree , Associate Professor of Anthropology, is a zooarchaeologist whose research interests center broadly on the uses of faunal remains to study past animal husbandry patterns, hunting practices, and diet. She is also interested in the use of archaeologically recovered animal remains to study trade, social status, ethnicity, and prehistoric ritual. Her primary area of interest is later prehistoric and early medieval Europe, but she has also worked on Natufian settlement and subsistence in the Southern Levant and 18th- and 19th-century sites in eastern North America. Crabtree is currently a member of an archaeological team that is surveying the Irish royal site of Dun Ailinne in Ireland. Her work has been published in a number of edited volumes and journals, including the Journal of Field Archaeology and World Archaeology . She and her co-author Bradley Adams recently completed a book entitled Comparative Skeletal Anatomy . Abortion: Examining the Issues (V28.0142; call # 72917) Instructor: Evelyn Birge Vitz Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00\u20133:15 p.m. This multidisciplinary course takes as its purpose a careful and thought-provoking examination of many issues surrounding abortion today. In a seminar setting, we will read about and discuss legal, medical, historical, psychological, political, religious, ethical, and gender questions in a balanced manner, considering both\u2014indeed, sometimes several\u2014sides of the issues involved. We will also look at the representation of and attitudes toward abortion in contemporary literature and popular culture. This seminar will provide a forum for civil, informed, and open discussion of this difficult issue. This course will count towards the major in Gender and Sexuality Studies.  Evelyn (Timmie) Birge Vitz is Professor of French, and Affiliated Professor of Comparative Literature, Religious Studies, and Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She has published widely on many aspects of medieval literature and culture. She has also been researching and writing about abortion for several years, and has held workshops of a dramatic script about abortion in New York and Washington, D.C.  \u201cVarieties of Religious Experience\u201d Revisited (V28.0144; call # 72918) Instructor: James Gilligan Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. This seminar will utilize but also update William James\u2019s pioneering approach to interpreting and understanding religion in psychological rather than theological terms. We will examine how the term \u201creligion\u201d is more confusing than helpful when it fails to differentiate between a wide variety of utterly incompatible beliefs and practices at different stages of cognitive and emotional development. We will discuss the phenomenon of \u201cpolitical religions\u201d (nationalism, racism, totalitarianism, apocalyptic fundamentalism) as attempts to reject or distort modernity (the worldview of modern science), in order to fill the vacuum that Sartre called \u201cthe God-shaped hole in the soul of modern man\u201d that resulted when the traditional sources of moral, legal, and political authority (God, religion, pure reason) lost their credibility as sources of knowledge. We will consider the political religions as resulting from psychological regression, and contrast them with the current moment in the evolution of religious consciousness, in which the challenge is to find progressive forms of religious expression, understanding and experience that are consistent with the modern scientific mentality, while not being reducible to it. The seminar will conclude by examining whether this is the context in which the next major step in the evolution of both culture and personality will need to occur. James Gilligan , Collegiate Professor, headed the Institute of Law and Psychiatry and directed mental health programs for the Massachusetts prison system while on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Department of Psychiatry. He has also served as President of the International Association for Forensic Psychotherapy, and as Chair of the Committee on prevention, which was part of President Clinton\u2019s National Campaign against Youth Violence.

(See the instructor\u2019s book and papers on \u201cmetapatterns\u201d for more.) Students will find this an exciting area of inquiry, and will enlarge their intellectual horizons as they engage in research that becomes more self-chosen during the course. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to enroll. Indeed, we seek a diversity of interests and knowledge skills.  Tyler Volk is Professor of Biology, Director of Science for the Environmental Studies Program, and a recent recipient of the University\u2019s Distinguished Teaching Award. He is the author of Metapatterns across Space, Time, and Mind and of recent papers that provide reasons for the generation of common functional principles at different scales. Several relevant papers can be accessed at http://pages.nyu.edu/~tv1/Volk.htm . Volk conducts research on the global carbon cycle and Earth\u2019s future and has written books on death-and-life as a scale-transcending pattern and on the multiple systems of our biosphere. He plays lead guitar for The Amygdaloids.  Reconstructing World Violence: A Hobbesian Approach (V28.0156; call # 72924) Instructor: William Klein Wednesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. Humans are as violent as any creature, but we have something in abundance that others may lack: the ability to sustain and glorify our violence by justifying it. After attempting to develop coherent accounts of this phenomenon, students in this seminar consider ways in which pacifist systems of thought have interacted with violent systems of justification, often but not always with genocidal results. It was in the midst of such a violent crisis that Hobbes initiated what remains an undeveloped approach. If one can extrapolate from Hobbes\u2019s nationalist agenda and redirect his approach in a democratic way, one can arrive (as many have) at the following claim: only when globally sovereign conflict-resolving institutions are fully authorized will any subordinate system justifying violence lose its force and coherence, except in the case of violent revolutionary movements which challenge the global authority itself. Partly by examining various fledgling attempts to operate aspects of a future sovereign system, we ask of this claim not so much whether it is practical as whether we resist its implications or suspect its grounding. William Klein teaches social foundations in NYU\u2019s Liberal Studies Program. In the College of Arts and Science he has also taught in both the Morse Academic Plan and the Freshman Honors Seminar Program. Before coming to NYU, he was at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he taught the history of Western social thought. He writes on a range of topics, from Renaissance political thought to constitutional history and (under a pen name) modern crime. Literature of the Absurd (V50.0160; call # 75378) Instructor: Tom Bishop Tuesday, 2:00\u20134:30 p.m. The absurd sensibility has profoundly marked writers of many countries and languages since the start of the 20th century. The notion of the absurd is most closely associated with the Theater of the Absurd, launched in the 1950s in Paris by, notably, Beckett and Ionesco, and continued worldwide by such playwrights as Pinter, Albee, Havel, and Frisch. But the preoccupation with the absurd was not limited to the theater; in the immediate post\u2013World War II period, the Existentialists already had posited the absurdity of the human condition, and works by Sartre and Camus brilliantly explored this philosophic position. The metaphysical anguish at the base of absurdist attitudes stemmed from what Martin Esslin, the author of the seminal Theater of the Absurd , called the disappearance of \u201cthe certitudes and unshakable basic assumptions of former ages.\u201d Kafka\u2019s work is exemplary; many other writers view the world as fundamentally absurd, including Pirandello, Stein, Gombrowicz, Grass, Heller, Cort\u00e1zar, Vonnegut, Pynchon, Kert\u00e9sz. Many filmmakers shared these perspectives, including Antonioni and Godard. In a century that witnessed two unbelievably destructive worldwide conflicts, that made possible the Holocaust and other genocides, that produced Hiroshima and the capacity for humankind to destroy itself and the entire world, it is no surprise that the absurd was a dominant stance, even if often treated with devastating humor. Tom Bishop is the Florence Gould Professor of French Literature and Professor of Comparative Literature and Director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture. He chaired the Department of French for 33 years. He has written extensively on European and American theater and on contemporary French fiction and civilization. His books include studies of Beckett, Sartre, 20th-century theater, and French cultural and political life. His most recent book, From the Left Bank: Reflections on Contemporary French Theater and Fiction , appeared in 1997. He has organized many literary conferences and festivals in New York and Paris, and has received numerous decorations from the French government as well as the Grand Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise. He earned an OBIE award for achievement in Off-Broadway Theater. Beginnings and Endings (and Middles) in Music and the Other Arts (V28.0161; call # 76098) Instructor: Michael Beckerman Tuesday and Thursday, 11:00 a.m.\u201312:15 p.m. What are the strategies and approaches used to begin pieces of music? What gestures signal conclusion in jazz, pop music, or African drumming? How do we understand genres, such as opera and concerto, that, in effect, begin more than once, when the curtain opens or the soloist enters? This course looks at a broad repertoire of music, from Beethoven\u2019s Fifth to \u201cI Heard It through the Grapevine,\u201d and from worldbeat to hip-hop, in order to explore the way musical compositions are started and stopped. But we also explore a realm stranger still: the middle. For while middles have a reputation as expendable transitions between points of importance, they are also places of great mystery, where material too strange, too delicate, or too sexy to touch the rest of the world finds a home. Although music will be at the \u201ccore\u201d of the course, we will also look comparatively at strategies in Shakespeare and experimental theater, in films such as those by David Lynch and the Coen Brothers, at examples from modern dance, and at storytelling ranging from the Bible and Moby Dick to manga. This course is designed to give students tools with which to ask new questions about what kind of stuff goes where and why that might be. There are no prerequisites for this course. It will count toward the Music major or minor. Michael Beckerman is Professor and Chair of Music. He has written books and articles on such topics as Gypsies, Film Music, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s \u201cNew World\u201d Symphony, Music and War, Czech Jazz, Historical Soundscapes, and Mozart\u2019s \u201cTurkish\u201d Rondo. He was for several years a special guest on PBS\u2019s Live from Lincoln Center , appears frequently on national radio, and writes for the New York Times .
