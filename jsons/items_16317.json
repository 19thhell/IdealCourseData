Hands-on Advocacy: NYU in Albany Day and NYU in DC Day   OGCA facilitates annual face-to-face meetings for undergraduates, graduates, and alumni to discuss the importance of financial aid with their legislative representatives at the State Capitol in Albany and on Capitol Hill in Washington DC . Your advocacy is crucial to securing the expansion of financial aid programs and bringing better access to higher education to many more would-be students.
