Abstract: This is an intermediate level, Ph.D. course in Applied  Econometrics . Topics to be studied include specification, estimation, and  inference in the context of models that include then extend beyond the standard  linear multiple regression framework. After a review of the linear model, we  will develop the asymptotic distribution theory necessary for analysis of  generalized linear and nonlinear models. We will then turn to instrumental  variables, maximum likelihood, generalized method of moments (GMM), and two step  estimation methods. Inference techniques used in the linear regression  framework such as t and F tests will be extended to include Wald,  Lagrange multiplier and likelihood ratio and tests for nonnested hypotheses  such as the Hausman specification test. Specific modelling frameworks will  include the linear regression model and extensions to models for panel data,  multiple equation models, time series models and models for discrete choice.         Prerequisites : Multivariate calculus, matrix algebra, probability  and distribution theory, statistical inference, and an introduction to the  multiple linear regression model . Appendices A and B in Greene  (2011) are assumed . We will survey the parts of Appendix C and  Chapter 2 that would have appeared in prerequisite courses. A significant part  of this course will focus on the advanced parts of Appendices C and D and  Chapters 4 through 7. We will also make use of a few of the results in Appendix  E.      Course Requirements : Grades for the course will be based on:         Midterm    examination (30%), The midterm examination will be given in class.    Take    home final exam (40%)    Several    problem sets and small projects (total 30%).               Course Materials :      Text: The required text for the course is Greene, W., Econometric  Analysis , 7 th Edition, Prentice Hall, 2011. (You may use the 6 th   edition if you prefer.) Other texts that might be useful are: Davidson, R., and  MacKinnon, J., Econometric Theory and Methods , Oxford University Press,  2004, which is more advanced than Greene; Johnston, J. and DiNardo, J., Econometric  Methods , 4 th Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1997, which is comparable to  Greene; and Kennedy, P., A Guide to Econometrics , 4 th   Edition, MIT Press, 1998, Woolridge, J., Introductory Econometrics: A Modern  Approach, 3rd Edition (or later) , Southwestern, 2006 (or later) or  Gujarati, D., Basic Econometrics , 4 rd Edition, McGraw-Hill,  2004, all of which are less advanced. Note: A useful list of errata and  comments submitted by readers of the text are listed at the website for the  text, http://people.stern.nyu.edu/wgreene/Text/econometricanalysis.htm    where there is a button for the  errata/discussion list.      Software: Some of the outside work for this course will involve  using a computer. Students may use any computer software that they are familiar  with for this purpose. I will provide a copy of NLOGIT to anyone  who wishes to use it. Data sets needed for the exercises will be  distributed to the class via the course website. The data sets used for  the examples in the text are all available at the text website.      Readings: A few relevant articles from the literature will be  suggested (not required). The papers listed are useful pedagogical literature,  and students intending to do empirical research for their dissertations will  probably find them worthwhile reading. The others are a selection from a huge  literature that should be both interesting and accessible to students in this  course.       Return to course home page.

Reading List (annotated)      Arellano, M. and O. Bover  &quot;Another Look at the Instrumental Variable  Estimation of Error-Components Models,&quot; Journal of Econometrics ,  68, 1995, pp. 29-51.      Ashenfelter, O., and Krueger, A ., &quot;Estimates of the Economic Returns to  Schooling from a New Sample of Twins,&quot; American Economic Review ,  84, 5, 1994, pp. 1157-1173. An intriguing study of measurement error and  instrumental variables estimation. Intriguing study of data on twins gathered  at a convention of twins in Twinsburg ,   Ohio .      Breusch, T., and Pagan, A ., &quot;The LM Test and Its Applications to Model  Specification in Econometrics,&quot; Review of Economic Studies , 47,  1980, pp. 239-254. Began a methodological shift in econometrics toward a  reinterpretation of existing tests and development of many new ones. Short  lived paradigm shift, as the tests are strongly parametric, and conflict with  the current trend toward less stringently parameterized models. An excellent  book with similar material, developed at length is Godfrey, L., Misspecification  Tests in Econometrics , Cambridge University Press, 1988. (Important  contribution to methodology.)      Breusch, T., and Pagan , A., &quot;A Simple Test for Heteroscedasticity and  Random Coefficients Variation,&quot; Econometrica , 47, 1979, pp.  1287-1294. Application of the LM methodology developed in fuller detail in the  1980 paper (they were done simultaneously) to a common problem. Has become  essentially the standard test for heteroscedasticity - soon to be supplanted by  the conditional moment test. (See Pagan and Vella.)      Christensen, L., and Greene, W ., &quot;Economies of Scale in U.S. Electric  Power Generation,&quot; Journal of Political Economy , 84, 1976, pp.  655-676. Application of specification testing in a model, showing how  theoretical propositions produce testable restrictions on the empirical model.  Fairly straightforward application of the seemingly unrelated regressions  model, maximum likelihood estimation, and use of likelihood ratio tests.         Frisch, R., and Waugh, F ., &quot;Partial Time Regressions as Compared with Individual  Trends,&quot; Econometrica , 1, 1933, pp. 387-401. Purely empirical  discovery of one of the fundamental pillars of econometrics, the Frisch-Waugh  theorem for partitioning a linear projection. Another high water mark in the  literature.      Greene, W., and Seaks, T ., &quot;The Restricted Least Squares Estimator: A  Pedagogical Note,&quot; Review of Economics and Statistics , 73, 1991,  pp. 563-567. Some interesting matrix algebra for the linear regression model  and restricted least squares. Surprise discovery of an apparently theretofore  overlooked (by econometricians, though not statisticians) aspect of linear  regression.      Harvey, A., &quot;Estimating Regression Models with  Multiplicative Heteroscedasticity,&quot; Econometrica , 44, 1976, pp.  461-465. Very general model for heteroscedasticity. A good companion to Breusch  and Pagan. Also illustrates an interesting application of Newton 's method and the method of scoring for  maximum likelihood estimation.      Hansen, L., &quot;Large Sample Properties of Generalized Method of  Moments Estimators,&quot; Econometrica , 50, 1982, pp. 1029-1054. Soon to  be classic, if not already, study of the method of moments. Pioneering paper  that has produced a major shift in the direction of econometric methodology.  One of the most influential methodological pieces since 1980, in close  competition with Dickey-Fuller on unit roots. Shows how estimators of model  parameters can be developed without need to make strong distributional  assumptions. Innovation in the literature - extremely influential.      Hausman, J., &quot;Specification Tests in Econometrics,&quot; Econometrica ,  46, 1978, pp. 1251-1271. Develops the &quot;Hausman Test,&quot; a now widely  used specification test that gets around the need for nested models imposed by  the conventional likelihood, Neyman-Pearson based tests.      Hausman, J., and Taylor, W., &quot;Panel Data and Unobservable Individual  Effects,&quot; Econometrica , 49, 1981, pp. 1377-1398. Extends the  familiar fixed and random effects models to some more involved cases. For  example, how to deal with fixed effects in models in which group effects are  fixed over time.      Heckman, J., &quot;Sample Selection Bias as a Specification  Error,&quot; Econometrica , 47, 1979, pp. 153-161. First in a literature  on two step estimation of models. A clever application of two step estimation in  a model of nonrandom sampling. (His work began on it as a Ph.D. student in  1970-1972) Began a debate on sample selection models that continues.  Interesting application for the form that methodological progress takes place.      Murphy, K., and Topel, R ., &quot;Estimation and Inference in Two Step  Econometric Models,&quot; Journal of Business and Economic Statistics ,  3, 1985, pp. 370-379. Lays out the computations needed for handling two step  maximum likelihood or least squares estimation. A now standard result. Applications  becoming increasingly common. Worth reading.      Newey, W., and West, K ., &quot;A Simple, Positive Semi-definite,  Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent Covariance Matrix,&quot; Econometrica ,  55, 1987, pp. 703-708. The canonical presentation of one of the most important  tools in the applied econometricians toolkit. Generalizes White's estimator,  and makes feasible, many GMM estimators in time series settings.      Revelt, D. and K. Train, &quot;Mixed Logit with Repeated Choices: Households'  Choices of Appliance Efficiency Level,&quot; Review of Economics and  Statistics, 1998, 80, , pp. 1-11.      Waugh, F., &quot;The Place of Least Squares in  Econometrics,&quot; Econometrica , 29, 1961, pp. 386-396. Historical  piece. Argues that OLS, which at that time, was becoming &quot;old fashioned&quot;  and ordinary was underappreciated in economics and produced important results.  Sounds like he was about 40 years before his time.      White, H., &quot;A Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Covariance  Matrix Estimator and Direct Test for Heteroscedasticity,&quot; Econometrica ,  48, 1980, 817-838. The White estimator for unknown heteroscedasticity.  Remarkably simple yet powerful estimator. A major step toward robust estimation  in econometrics. Very important paper.
