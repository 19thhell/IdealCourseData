The majority of the interviews, particularly in Series       I, were collected by the Oral History of American Left for deposit at the Tamiment       Library. At the same time, OHAL solicited and accepted recordings from scholars, filmmakers,       activists, and other likeminded individuals who were not affiliated with the project.       OHAL staff actively took interviews between 1976-1985. The collection of interviews       by OHAL and Tamiment Library continued through the late 2000s at a diminished pace.              The collection also contains materials that were created or collected by the Tamiment       Institute before the establishment of OHAL.                          Processing Information note        The Oral History of the American Left has seen many waves of processing since its       founding in 1976. The two primary access tools resulting from the first wave of processing       were indexes and Jonathan Bloom and Paul Buhle's         Guide to the Oral History of the American Left , published in 1984. Discovery tools were updated as new tapes were added to the collection.       A wide range of appraisal guidelines, arrangement strategies, and numbering schemes       were deployed by the archivists working on the collection over the decades. At times,       this created inconsistencies in collection management and description.              Digitization began in the late 2000s, employing outside vendors and NewYork University's       Preservation Department. Transcription had occurred since the 1980s, and another batch       of interviews was transcribed and edited in the early 2010s.              In 2012, efforts to complete the digitization were resumed in earnest, and digitization       of Series I was completed in 2015. This push was supported by three grants from the       Korein Foundation, and sustained use of New York University's in-house transfer capabilities       for the transfer of OHAL materials.              In conjunction with the digitization, a serious effort was undertaken to consolidate       physical control over Series I. Different generations of cassettes were stored in       different locations throughout the library, and a major effort was undertaken to reconcile       these materials and confirm that the library was digitizing the most complete versions       of interviews. At the same time, a new online finding aid was written, consolidating       legacy description from multiple sources, updating it to conform to modern archival       standards, and creating new content. This was completed in 2015.              Less visibly, a major effort was undertaken to standardize the diverse naming conventions       for digital surrogates from in the first wave of digitization projects. Files in the       library's digital preservation repository we mapped and batch renamed for better control       over digital assets. This too was completed in 2015"}]},

The purpose of this project was to expand the archive's documentation       of radicalism and labor by recording the memories of veteran activists before they       were lost. The founders of OHAL were working within the milieu of \"new social history\"       and were intent on using the Oral History of the American Left to collect stories       from groups often underrepresented in traditional historical narratives including       rank and file activists, women, and ethnic minorities. The project founders, by their       own admission, were a part of a revival of interest in folkloric community histories       and captivated by the ability of the recorded interview to bring these stories to       life. They also were cognizant of the interviewer\u2019s role in shaping an oral history,       and the interviewers' own activism is also frequently on display. As such, decades       later, the early interviews of the collection not only give insight into the experiences       of activists from the 1910s-1960s, but illuminate the psychology of the Left during       the Reagan era.            Paul Buhle was the director of the project from its founding, and was its most prolific       interviewer. Other staff included Roger Keeran who was co-director in the early years       and Jon Bloom who joined the project in 1977 to work as an interviewer, coordinator,       and fundraiser. Additional OHAL staff in the 1980s included interviewer and project       coordinator Ruth F. Prago, interviewer Bea Lemisch, and indexer Ameila Green.            Interviewing began with a series of small grants provided by the Rabinowitz and Bronson       Cutting Foundations. The New Jersey Historical Commission provided funding in 1978       to support interviews on radicalism in New Jersey between 1930 and 1960. Later, Ruth       F. Prago developed the idea to start a radio series based on interviews held for the       OHAL collection. Together with Pacifica Radio the project received a one-year grant       from the New York State Council for the Humanities to conduct interviews with twenty-five       women about radicalism during the 1930s. Radio producers used these interviews to       create the radio series \"Grandma was an Activist,\" first broadcast in 1983. OHAL received       major funding in 1982\u20131983 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This support       enabled Paul Buhle to build a comprehensive collection of oral histories regarding       ethnic-immigrant radicalism, its press, and fraternal organizations. The NEH grant       also enabled OHAL to collect hundreds of hours of interviews made by filmmakers on       American anarchism, the Hollywood blacklist, the Communist Party, the Columbia University       student strike of 1968, and other subjects.            From its founding, OHAL was intended to be a comprehensive document of the experiences       of the members of the Left in the United States, and it was assumed that the collection       would continue to grow over time. Tamiment Library continued to conduct interviews       and collect interviews from third parties through the 1990s and into the early 2010s."}]},

Researchers       may view an item\u2019s original container, but the media themselves are not available       for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already       been digitized are noted in the collection\u2019s finding aid and can be requested in our       reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before       they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation       of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access       copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu                          Immediate Source of Acquisition note        From its inception, the Oral History of the American Left was an assembled collection       with a diverse provenance. The majority of the interviews, particularly in Series       I, were collected by the Oral History of American Left for deposit at the Tamiment       Library. At the same time, OHAL solicited and accepted recordings from scholars, filmmakers,       activists, and other likeminded individuals who were not affiliated with the project.       OHAL staff actively took interviews between 1976-1985. The collection of interviews       by OHAL and Tamiment Library continued through the late 2000s at a diminished pace.              The collection also contains materials that were created or collected by the Tamiment       Institute before the establishment of OHAL.                          Processing Information note        The Oral History of the American Left has seen many waves of processing since its       founding in 1976. The two primary access tools resulting from the first wave of processing       were indexes and Jonathan Bloom and Paul Buhle's         Guide to the Oral History of the American Left , published in 1984. Discovery tools were updated as new tapes were added to the collection.       A wide range of appraisal guidelines, arrangement strategies, and numbering schemes       were deployed by the archivists working on the collection over the decades. At times,       this created inconsistencies in collection management and description.              Digitization began in the late 2000s, employing outside vendors and NewYork University's       Preservation Department. Transcription had occurred since the 1980s, and another batch       of interviews was transcribed and edited in the early 2010s.              In 2012, efforts to complete the digitization were resumed in earnest, and digitization       of Series I was completed in 2015. This push was supported by three grants from the       Korein Foundation, and sustained use of New York University's in-house transfer capabilities       for the transfer of OHAL materials.              In conjunction with the digitization, a serious effort was undertaken to consolidate       physical control over Series I. Different generations of cassettes were stored in       different locations throughout the library, and a major effort was undertaken to reconcile       these materials and confirm that the library was digitizing the most complete versions       of interviews. At the same time, a new online finding aid was written, consolidating       legacy description from multiple sources, updating it to conform to modern archival       standards, and creating new content. This was completed in 2015.              Less visibly, a major effort was undertaken to standardize the diverse naming conventions       for digital surrogates from in the first wave of digitization projects. Files in the       library's digital preservation repository we mapped and batch renamed for better control       over digital assets. This too was completed in 2015"}, {"content": "Guide to the Oral History of the American Left Collection    OH.002                    See all finding aids in this repository Table of Contents           Descriptive Summary    Historical/Biographical Note    Scope and Content Note and Arrangement    Access Points    Administrative Information    Container List     Oral History of the American Left Main Series     Fred Zimring Interviews     Reynold Hills Project Interviews        Filmmakers' Tapes and Transcripts       Seeing Red            The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter            A Crime to Fit the Punishment            Tighten Your Belts, Bite the Bullet            Anarchism in America            Free Voice of Labor            Trouble on Fashion Avenue            The Case of the Legless Veteran: James Kutcher            Peekskill Work in Progress                   Tamiment Institute Tapes     Aleine Austin Tapes regarding      Monthly Review and Highlander Folk School     Restricted Interviews in Oral History of the American Left     Higley Hill     Rose Leopold                          Print / View Finding Aid as Single Page Guide to the Oral History of the American Left Collection     OH.002                Elmer Holmes Bobst Library 70 Washington Square South New York, NY, 10012 (212) 998-2630 tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu  Tamiment Library and Robert F.

The purpose of this project was to expand the archive's documentation       of radicalism and labor by recording the memories of veteran activists before they       were lost. The founders of OHAL were working within the milieu of \"new social history\"       and were intent on using the Oral History of the American Left to collect stories       from groups often underrepresented in traditional historical narratives including       rank and file activists, women, and ethnic minorities. The project founders, by their       own admission, were a part of a revival of interest in folkloric community histories       and captivated by the ability of the recorded interview to bring these stories to       life. They also were cognizant of the interviewer\u2019s role in shaping an oral history,       and the interviewers' own activism is also frequently on display. As such, decades       later, the early interviews of the collection not only give insight into the experiences       of activists from the 1910s-1960s, but illuminate the psychology of the Left during       the Reagan era.            Paul Buhle was the director of the project from its founding, and was its most prolific       interviewer. Other staff included Roger Keeran who was co-director in the early years       and Jon Bloom who joined the project in 1977 to work as an interviewer, coordinator,       and fundraiser. Additional OHAL staff in the 1980s included interviewer and project       coordinator Ruth F. Prago, interviewer Bea Lemisch, and indexer Ameila Green.            Interviewing began with a series of small grants provided by the Rabinowitz and Bronson       Cutting Foundations. The New Jersey Historical Commission provided funding in 1978       to support interviews on radicalism in New Jersey between 1930 and 1960. Later, Ruth       F. Prago developed the idea to start a radio series based on interviews held for the       OHAL collection. Together with Pacifica Radio the project received a one-year grant       from the New York State Council for the Humanities to conduct interviews with twenty-five       women about radicalism during the 1930s. Radio producers used these interviews to       create the radio series \"Grandma was an Activist,\" first broadcast in 1983. OHAL received       major funding in 1982\u20131983 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. This support       enabled Paul Buhle to build a comprehensive collection of oral histories regarding       ethnic-immigrant radicalism, its press, and fraternal organizations. The NEH grant       also enabled OHAL to collect hundreds of hours of interviews made by filmmakers on       American anarchism, the Hollywood blacklist, the Communist Party, the Columbia University       student strike of 1968, and other subjects.            From its founding, OHAL was intended to be a comprehensive document of the experiences       of the members of the Left in the United States, and it was assumed that the collection       would continue to grow over time. Tamiment Library continued to conduct interviews       and collect interviews from third parties through the 1990s and into the early 2010s."}, {"content": "Guide to the Oral History of the American Left Collection    OH.002                    See all finding aids in this repository Table of Contents           Descriptive Summary    Historical/Biographical Note    Scope and Content Note and Arrangement    Access Points    Administrative Information    Container List     Oral History of the American Left Main Series     Fred Zimring Interviews     Reynold Hills Project Interviews        Filmmakers' Tapes and Transcripts       Seeing Red            The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter            A Crime to Fit the Punishment            Tighten Your Belts, Bite the Bullet            Anarchism in America            Free Voice of Labor            Trouble on Fashion Avenue            The Case of the Legless Veteran: James Kutcher            Peekskill Work in Progress                   Tamiment Institute Tapes     Aleine Austin Tapes regarding      Monthly Review and Highlander Folk School     Restricted Interviews in Oral History of the American Left     Higley Hill     Rose Leopold                          Print / View Finding Aid as Single Page Guide to the Oral History of the American Left Collection     OH.002                Elmer Holmes Bobst Library 70 Washington Square South New York, NY, 10012 (212) 998-2630 tamiment.wagner@library.nyu.edu  Tamiment Library and Robert F.
