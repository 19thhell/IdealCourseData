In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Marx, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?            Classical Literature &amp; Philosophy: Gender &amp; Genre    Bianchi    Thurs   11:00-1:45pm   COLIT-UA 160   In this course we will explore the co-emergence of philosophy and various literary genres (epic, lyric poetry, dialogue, tragedy, comedy) in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the development of literary and rhetorical theory. Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao.

By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.

Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud.

Description       To many people the latest theories in science may seem distant and otherworldly. Complex mathematics and subject-specific technical jargon can form intimidating barriers to modern scientific understanding. Why then are big science fiction movies like Star Wars and Avatar so successful at the box office? Is the sci-fi genre simply a social lubricant for the acceptance of science? Do these fictional narratives prophetically predict innovations within the sciences or do they actually serve to inspire these innovations? At its core, the sci-fi genre emerges from the interlacing of scientific rationality and the escapism of story-telling, extrapolating current scientific knowledge into alternate realities. In this seminar we will explore the genre of science fiction and its underlying literary and scientific elements. Students will write two expository essays and a short story. Readings may include works by: Voltaire, Isaac Asimov, Ursula K. Le Guin, Arthur C. Clarke, Orson Scott Card, Alice Sheldon, Kurt Vonnegut, Octavia Butler, H.G. Wells, Philip K. Dick, Mary Shelley, Robert A. Heinlein, and Jules Verne.

In other words, we like to think of ourselves as subjects. The self-conscious and autonomous subject constitutes itself in relation to what is \u2018other.\u2019 But what is this \u2018other\u2019? The word \u2018other\u2019 does not always refer to another person: It may also refer to constitutive events, or \u2018necessary fictions.\u2019 These \u2018others\u2019 may be the addressees of our poems, the material and immaterial products of our imaginations, and indeed the otherness we find in ourselves. How do we relate to these \u2018others\u2019? How do desire, action, and ethical duty (but also fate, guilt, and the law), allow us to perceive ourselves as free? We will explore these and other questions as they have been posed in literary works by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Plato, Ovid, Garcilaso de la Vega, Racine, Keats, Poe, Gautier, Baudelaire, Melville, Lorca, Kafka, Beckett, paintings by Da Vinci and Vel\u00e1zquez, and philosophical and theoretical writings by Kant, Hegel, Freud, Marx, Saussure, Heidegger, Lacan, and Levinas. Though the tragic fate of Agamemnon or Oedipus appears inevitable, in our reading we explore how fate is a necessary fiction that enables action. Today we have transferred the power of fate onto other essentialized constructs such as the free market, advertising, or intelligence organizations which come to structure our desires and dictate the course of our lives. We will trace how inspiration may be found in negation by reading literary texts on the unknown contents of letters \u2013 as in Poe \u2013or on endless waiting for what will never come\u2014as in Melville and Beckett. Situated at intersection of the different discourses that comprise Comparative Literature \u2013 fiction, poetry, art, philosophy, psychoanalysis, and political theory \u2013 this class aims to problematize the notion of modern subjectivity. Our primary concerns will be at once ethical and poetic: How can what exceeds knowledge and representation signal itself in thought?            Classical Literature &amp; Philosophy: Gender &amp; Genre    Bianchi    Thurs   11:00-1:45pm   COLIT-UA 160   In this course we will explore the co-emergence of philosophy and various literary genres (epic, lyric poetry, dialogue, tragedy, comedy) in ancient Greece and Rome, as well as the development of literary and rhetorical theory. Through close readings of primary texts we will observe how certain themes (e.g. justice, love, desire) are expressed across different genres, and how (and how successfully) philosophy and the emerging arts of poetics and rhetoric distinguish themselves and develop throughout the classical antiquity. Authors include Homer, the Presocratic philosophers, Plato,Aristotle, Sappho, Euripides, Aristophanes, Lucretius, Cicero, Horace, Longinus, Quintilian, and various modern and contemporary commentators. Our study will be divided into five thematic units: 1. First Beginnings; 2. Philosophy and Poetry; 3. Love and Desire in Ancient Greek Philosophy and Literature; 4. Classical Rhetoric. The course will be primarily discussion based. We will work on carefully understanding, analyzing, and criticizing texts, considering the significance of genre in classical thinking, appreciating classical texts in their cultural context, and developing written and spoken skills. Each week students will be required to read approximately 60-120 pages of text (toward the upper end for literary texts, and the lower end for philosophical/theoretical texts).        African Literature: Arts, Literature &amp; Film    Diawara Thurs 2:00-4:45pm COLIT-UA 844   A look at contemporary African Literature, film and art as a way of examining different outcomes of postcolonial cultural policies and practices in Africa. The main topics include 1) a discussion of the Negritude Movement and the artistic legacy of Leopold Sedar Senghor; 2) a close look at the Guinean Cultural Revolution and the African experimentations with Marxist and socialist realist art forms; 3) Pan-Africanism and art; and 4) the post-nationalist writers and video artists of Nigeria. The aim of the class is to provide students with a sense of the context of artistic productions in Africa. It is hoped that students will gain an understanding of some of the major trends in African literature and film; and become conversant with the politics, aesthetics and reception theories behind African imaginative works.      Topics in Film and Literature: South by South: Ideological Maps And Fictions of Uneven Development Dopico Tues 2-4:45pm COLIT-UA 300.001 SPAN-UA 551.002 This course considers the \u201cidea of  the South\u201d as geopolitical territory, imaginary landscape and ideological  map:a fictive and creative topos where  regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural  imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives and alternative histories.  Reading comparatively, south by south,  we discover a dynamic cultural genealogy from the global South\u2019s western  hemisphere that precedes the urgency of current debates about uneven  development and the problems of North and South. We will encounter artists who manipulate and  contest the political imaginary and the fictive qualities  assigned to the South and its subjects.Engaging works that exalt or decry that ideological geography, we will  examine how these artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and  its fictions.    Lectures and section discussions will  consider works that reflect on different Souths and consider how they portray  seductive, dangerous, infantile, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures.  In texts, visual art, and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider  how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South  becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the  realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous, childlike, or  exotic status on political maps and cultural markets. We will question why writers explore lost  worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s buried history to fictively rework  and revive the past. We will consider  why outsiders, children, and outlaws are central tropes. We will think about  the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how  they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of  the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred  and loyalty in the South. In our reading  we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d  the South and those who live or pass through it. We will consider stories that manipulate the  status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of  the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment   of the exile, and the collecting and  correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics  and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary  and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and  neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political  conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.   Primary texts will include many  of the following Giuseppe di Lampedusa, The Leopard, Leonardo Sciascia, The  Wine Dark Sea, Thomas Mann, \u201cDeath in Venice,\u201d \u201cMario and the Magician,\u201d   Albert Camus, The Stranger, Andr\u00e9 Gide, \u201c The Immoralist,\u201d W.E.B DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, William  Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom!, Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were  Watching God, Richard Wright, Black  Boy , selections from Uncle Tom\u2019s Children, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Wise  Blood , The Violent Bear It Away, Dorothy Allison, Bastard out of  Carolina, Alejo Carpentier, The Lost Steps, Juan Rulfo, Pedro  P\u00e1ramo, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, One Hundred Years of Solitud, Junot D\u00edaz, The Brief Wondrous Life of  Oscar Wao.

By the early 1940s, when he became the most famous black writer in the world and acquired a global reading public, Wright had amassed a wide range of books across many genres and literary traditions. This course explores Wright's career through an examination of works that figured in his intellectual formation and works by authors Wright in turn influenced. The course begins with key writings by Wright and the critical reception of his work in the U.S. and Europe during his lifetime and proceeds through a chronological examination of pivotal texts he encountered. Works by Marx, Proust, Horatio Alger, Gertrude Stein, H. L. Mencken, Theodore Dreiser, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ralph Ellison, George Lamming, Lillian Smith, James Baldwin, William James, and Kenneth Burke, among others, will form the course reading list.      Jr. Theory Seminar: Modernity    Iampolski    Tues 4:55-7:35pm   COLIT-UA 200   Modernity is a product of  Enlightenment that dramatically changed the face of the Western culture by  proclaiming the autonomy and supremacy of human Reason. This new attitude  allowed an unprecedented development of science and became a basis for many fundamental achievements of the Western  civilization. However the same attitude has created a lot of contradictions  that define modernity. The course is designed to analyze the antinomies of the  culture of modernity. We will start with a founding  document of European rationalism - philosophical statements by Descartes and  will see how the cult of Reason and the great western political principles (equality of rights, the rule of  law) related to the dominance of Reason are paradoxically responsible for new  kinds of violence and social exclusion.   The following subjects (among  others) will be discussed:   -- Modern Rationality and Modern  Science.   -- Changing notion of Experience.   -- New understanding of Space, Distance, Time.   -- Culture of appearances.   -- Nation, State.   -- Democracy and Totalitarianism.   -- Violence, War and Discipline.   -- Machines.   -- Market, Money and the Struggle for Survival.   -- Commodity and Desire.    Readings include: Marx,  Freud, Descartes, Arendt, Foucault, Benjamin, Elias, Deleuze, Balibar, Lefort  and many others.      Topics in 20th Century Literature: Paranoid Narratives Sanders Wed 12:30-3:15pm COLIT-UA 190   It\u2019s no secret that we live in an age of paranoia. What  began as a psychiatric diagnosis may now be the predominant form taken by our  experience of politics and of technology. But could there be something about  the very structure of narrative itself\u2014its \u201cvoices\u201d and its \u201cspeakers\u201d\u2014that is  paranoid, or gives rise to paranoia? Tracing psychoanalytic theories of  paranoia (Sigmund Freud, Melanie Klein), and attending no less to their   narrative structure, we address this question and others by reading key  autobiographical and fictional works, such as may include Daniel Paul  Schreber\u2019s Memoirs of My Nervous Illness , George Orwell\u2019s Nineteen  Eighty-Four , James Ellroy\u2019s American  Tabloid , as well as political writings and documents by Richard Hofstadter,  Michel Foucault, Julian Assange (Wikileaks), South African AIDS denialists, and  Rwandan g\u00e9nocidaires .      Studies in Prose Genres: Autobiography Sieburth Mon/Wed 11:00-12:15pm COLIT-UA 125   The word Autobiography can be etymologically decomposed  into: autos (\u201cself\u201d) + bios (\u201clife\u201d) + graph\u00ea (\u201cwriting\u201d), and over the course of the semester we will be looking at the interaction of these three elements as the genre of autobiography evolves over time. Until the 20 th century, autobiography has been, for the most, a predominantly Western practice\u2014for very specific religious and cultural reasons, which we shall explore and which have to do with the particular constructions of the \u201cself\u201d associated with the Judeo-Christian tradition. Examples of autobiographical writing, however, can also be found in classical Chinese and Japanese cultures, and we shall accordingly examine a few samples of these at the outset of the course by reading a few short Confucian autobiographies, selections from The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagan , and Shen Fu\u2019s Six Records of a Floating Life . We will then turn our attention to the Confessions of St. Augustine, a conversion narrative which in many ways provides the master-text of Western autobiography. This will be followed by another Christian \u201cLife,\u201d the earliest known text of its sort in vernacular English, the 15 th -century Book of Margery Kempe . Selections from Montaigne\u2019s Essays will then be placed against this religious tradition of autobiography: emphasis will be laid not only on the more secularized or \u201chumanist\u201d notions of the self emerging during the Renaissance, but on the essay-form itself as providing a non-narrative model for self-portraiture. From Montaigne, we will turn to Puritan and early Republican America, represented by the \u201ccaptivity narrative\u201d of Mary Rowlandson and by Ben Franklin\u2019s slippery account of his self-fashioning into celebrity. This will lead into a reading of the first six books of Rousseau\u2019s Confessions , which rewrite Augustine while setting the agenda for the next two centuries of modern autobiography. Equally influential, at least insofar as the African American literary tradition is concerned, is the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass , which blends elements of the sentimental novel and the European picaresque into a call for political self-liberation through writing. The final unit of the course will focus on the impact of psychiatry and psychoanalysis on modern autobiography: the texts include Aur\u00e9lia , G\u00e9rard de Nerval\u2019s account of his descent into \u201cmadness,\u201d Michel Leiris\u2019s post-surrealist Manhood , and the poet H.D.\u2019s account of her analysis in Vienna with the master himself, Tribute to Freud. Note: Course enrollment limited to 20. Requirements: Four short papers (5-7 pp.) over the course of the semester.

Though dubbed \u201cLab Lit\u201d by biologist Jennifer L. Rohn, these novels feature not only laboratory scientists but the naturalists of Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s\u00a0 Prodigal Summer \u00a0, the mathematicians of Janna Levin\u2019s\u00a0 A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines \u00a0, and the neurosurgeon of Ian McEwan\u2019s\u00a0 Saturday \u00a0. This class takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding this new genre. At times, we\u2019ll use a literary studies perspective, asking how such novels create fictional drama and narrative suspense out of scientific work. We\u2019ll also draw on research in the history and sociology of science that examines the construction of scientific identity and the dynamics of the scientific community, as we look at how these novels represent scientists and the scientific world. And we\u2019ll turn to feminist critiques of science and work in science studies that interrogates the very nature of scientific research and thinking. In addition to the novels listed above, readings may include Richard Powers\u2019s\u00a0 Galatea 2.2 \u00a0, Allegra Goodman\u2019s\u00a0 Intuition \u00a0, Alan Lightman\u2019s\u00a0 Einstein\u2019s Dreams \u00a0, Max Weber\u2019s \u201cScience as a Vocation,\u201d Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar\u2019s\u00a0 Laboratory Life \u00a0, and essays by Evelyn Fox Keller and Sandra Hrdy.
