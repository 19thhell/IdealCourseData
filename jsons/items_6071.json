Students incorporate nursing, medical, and psychosocial concepts into assessment, diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and management of culturally diverse patient populations with acute, critical, and/or chronic illnesses. Students refine their diagnostic reasoning skills and diagnostic evaluation abilities. Utilizing principles of evidence based practice, students formulate a treatment plan that reflects the best evidence, individual patient preferences, and clinical judgment to promote achievement of clinical outcomes. As students complete this last clinical course, an emphasis is placed on the comprehensive management of a variety of complex and concomitant health problems, both acute and chronic. The leadership role of the acute care nurse practitioner is fostered along with best treatment practices in collaboration and conjunction with the interdisciplinary team.
