Description       Worlds of social dance often find their genesis among artists, rebels, non-conformists, and others who are deliberately or accidently marginal to mainstream capitalist culture. From the bordellos of Buenos Aires, where tango was born, to the honky-tonks of Nashville, to the jazz clubs of New Orleans and New York, to say nothing of contemporary raves, social dance\u2019s roots may be found in transgressive behavior. Dancers in these scenes are often referred to as obsessed, addicted, and out of control. But whose control? In this course we examine the relation of the moving body to music and transgression, analyzing the way aesthetic styles create demimondes and subcultures that transform gender relations and public affect writ large. Beginning with theories of the aesthetic that explain the power of the body in cultural expression, we move on to examine dance worlds in their historical and ethnographic context, paying close attention to the politics of the body and its influence on changing parameters of social permissibility. We will also explore dancers\u2019 efforts to test behaviors and assert identities outside the confines of the ordered, everyday world and consider what qualities are lost or gained when these dances become adopted for mainstream consumption. We will read works by Pierre Bordieu, Marcel Mauss, Jacques Ranciere, Jose Munoz, Jane Desmond, Sarah Thornton, Fiona Buckland, Robert Farris Thompson, Julie Taylor, Juliet McMains, Frances Aparicio, Marta Savigliano, Barbara Browning, and Tricia Rose, among others.

Description       Worlds of social dance often find their genesis among artists, rebels, non-conformists, and others who are deliberately or accidently marginal to mainstream capitalist culture. From the bordellos of Buenos Aires, where tango was born, to the honky-tonks of Nashville, to the jazz clubs of New Orleans and New York, to say nothing of contemporary raves, social dance\u2019s roots may be found in transgressive behavior. Dancers in these scenes are often referred to as obsessed, addicted, and out of control. But whose control? In this course we examine the relation of the moving body to music and transgression, analyzing the way aesthetic styles create demimondes and subcultures that transform gender relations and public affect writ large. Beginning with theories of the aesthetic that explain the power of the body in cultural expression, we move on to examine dance worlds in their historical and ethnographic context, paying close attention to the politics of the body and its influence on changing parameters of social permissibility. We will also explore dancers\u2019 efforts to test behaviors and assert identities outside the confines of the ordered, everyday world and consider what qualities are lost or gained when these dances become adopted for mainstream consumption. We will read works by Pierre Bordieu, Marcel Mauss, Jacques Ranciere, Jose Munoz, Jane Desmond, Sarah Thornton, Fiona Buckland, Robert Farris Thompson, Julie Taylor, Juliet McMains, Frances Aparicio, Marta Savigliano, Barbara Browning, and Tricia Rose, among others.

Launched by former dancer and renowned historian Jennifer Homans, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Center for Ballet and the Arts at NYU is an international institute for scholars and artists of ballet and its related arts and sciences. Its mission is to inspire new ideas and new dances, expanding the way we think about ballet and bringing vitality to its history, practice, and performance in the 21st century.   \u201cBallet today is adrift, in part because it is perceived as elite and inaccessible,\u201d said Dr. Homans. \u201cOur goal at the Center for Ballet and the Arts is twofold: to break open the increasingly narrow world of ballet as a performing art and bring to it new ideas and the full resources of a major resource university, and to bring ballet into the university as a serious subject of study and research, establishing it as a field within the arts and sciences.\u201d   The new Center will approach the study of ballet by drawing fellows from around the world and across a wide range of fields with a shared passion for and interest in the history and practice of ballet. Initial funding for the Center has been provided by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which will enable the Center to fund five full fellows and several associate fellows for the upcoming semester, in addition to developing other programs. The Center\u2019s fall 2014 fellows will include:   \u2022 John Carrafa, director/choreographer  \u2022 Gregory Mosher, Professor of Professional Practice, Columbia University, School of the Arts; producer, director  \u2022 J. David Velleman, Professor of Philosophy and Bioethics, New York University  \u2022 Heather Watts, dancer, educator, arts advocate  \u2022 Frederick Wiseman, filmmaker  \u2022 Christopher d'Amboise, director/choreographer (associate fellow)  \u2022 John Michael Schert, Visiting Artist and Social Entrepreneur, The University of Chicago (associate fellow)   \u201cHomans\u2019s book Apollo\u2019s Angels brilliantly traces the social and cultural significance of ballet and delineates the causes of its current state of drift and malaise,\u201d said Reynold Levy, President of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts from 2002-2014 and a member of the Advisory Board for the Center. \u201cWe believe the Center will bring to ballet the kind of research and debate it needs and deserves. By embracing scholars and practitioners from many disciplines, we aim to help invigorate the art form.\u201d   In addition to Levy, other Advisory Board members include an eclectic mix of influential academic and cultural leaders, including architect Elizabeth Diller, historian Simon Schama, designer Isaac Mizrahi, choreographers William Forsythe and Mark Morris, and filmmaker Frederick Wiseman. In addition to its Resident Fellows program, the Center\u2019s initial programs include public conversations between artists and intellectuals across a range of fields and the Lincoln Kirstein Lecture, a major public lecture to be delivered annually on the subject of dance. The inaugural Lincoln Kirstein Lecture will be held in the fall of 2015 and will feature Helen Vendler, Arthur Kingsley Porter University Professor at Harvard University, speaking on poetry and dance. The Center will also host open ballet master classes taught by accomplished choreographers, followed by a discussion with scholars and/or artists from different fields.   The Center hopes to develop collaborations nationally and internationally with other arts organizations interested in expanding ballet and has several projects in the works. Its first joint event will be a conversation with choreographer and MacArthur Fellow Alexei Ratmansky, moderated by Paul Holdengr\u00e4ber as part of The New York Public Library\u2019s LIVE from the NYPL series. The event will take place on October 8th at 7 p.m. Visit here for more information.   The Center for Ballet and the Arts will mark its official opening on September 22 with a presentation by Jennifer Homans followed by a master class and discussion with choreographer Mark Morris.
