V29.0300, V95.0551.001 (permission of instructor required) Reading comparatively, south by south, this course considers the \u201cidea of the South\u201d as a real and imagined territory, a potent ideological geography, where regional mythology, racial divisions, national contests, and cultural imperialism together produce extraordinary narratives. This course looks to literature, narrative, and film, to trace a history of ideas and imagination that predates the urgency of current debates about the global south and the problem of uneven development. We will be concerned with artists who know the political imaginary and the fictive qualities assigned to the South and its subjects. In reading across a wide range of works that exalts or decries that ideological geography, we will examine how artists remake \u201cthe South,\u201d and how they engage the North and its fictions.    We will consider works that reflect on different Souths as both home and destination, and consider how they portray seductive, dangerous, charming, backward, or even criminal cultures. In texts and films from Europe and the Americas, we will consider how realities and fantasies of the South are represented, how a global South becomes a true fiction, and how writers from \u201cSouthern\u201d places respond to the realities of uneven development and to their own barbarous or exotic status. Readings will focus on the ways in which artists develop and contest depictions of the South as places where crises over nationhood and progress take place, and where the social \u201crealities\u201d of the North cannot hold.    We will question why writers explore lost worlds, or belatedly return to a region\u2019s lost history to fictively reinscribe the past. In so doing, we will explore the exceptional \u201crepresentational burden\u201d of Southern artists and consider how they negotiate their double bind -- how they engage the biases and appetites of the North and at the same time respond to the weight of history, self-hatred and loyalty in the South. In our reading we will trace the tension of the North-South axis in narratives that \u201cexplain\u201d the South and those who live or pass through it, we will consider stories that manipulate the status of the native artist (or native informant), the promise and mirage of the cultural tourist, the uneasy spectatorship of the imperial traveler, the ressentiment of the exile, and the collecting and correcting anthropology of the political and economic immigrant. Thinking about the relationship between geopolitics and regional mythology, we will consider the enduring forms of this imaginary and ideological mapping, how it has been vital to nationalism, empire and neo-colonialism, but also how it continues to function in the political conflicts and cultural markets of \u201cglobalization.    Junior Theory Seminar: Test and its Meaning Iampolski Wed 4:55-7:35, 4 pts. V29.0200    The Epic Poem from Homer to Milton Javitch Tues/Thurs 12:30-1:45, 4 pts. V29.0106, V65.0106       We will, first of all, read with some care the following epics: Homer\u2019s Iliad, Virgil\u2019s Aeneid , The Song of Roland, , Tasso\u2019s Jerusalem Delivered, and Milton's Paradise Lost .    What can reading these epics tell us about war and heroism in Western culture? Or about history? Or the idea of empire? What governs relations between the human and the divine? Can the claims of duty,reason, piety be reconciled with those of pleasure, passion, and fury? What do these epics reveal about the changes that occur over time in Western notions of individual worth.    In addition to discussing these issues we will also address the following, more literary questions: what are the recurring features that define epic as a genre? How are the grand effects (scale,scope, style) of epic achieved? What constitutes poetic imitation? What is its function in epics after Homer\u2019s? How do new poets use or exploit the epic tradition they inherit to stage their own critical departures from their predecessors? Is the writing of epic still possible in modern times?    There will be a midterm and final exam, and students will be asked to write short paper.    Texts and Ideas: Topics: Animal Humans Lezra Mon/Wed 3:30-4:45 V55.0400 (This MAP course may also count as a CL core course with permission from DUGS; Recitaion required) \u201cOne might go so far as to define man as a creature that has failed in its effort to keep itsanimalness\u2026\u201d So writes the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk. What sort of animal were we? Where, how and by whom has the line between the human and the animal been drawn?With what consequences for our \u201chuman\u201d understanding of the world? Of concepts like the\u201csoul,\u201d \u201csociety,\u201d politics, the family? Is the line between the human and the animal drawndifferently in different genres\u2014in literary works, theological treatises, natural histories, paintings,films? We will come at these questions from different angles, following them in the Hebrew andChristian scriptures, pre-Socratic and other classical works (Ovid, Pliny, Euripides), in earlymodern responses to these questions (in works by Marie de France, Shakespeare, Montaigne,Descartes, Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Titian), in essays by contemporaryphilosophers and advocates (Singer, Derrida), and in films that treat the blurring of bordersbetween humans and animals (Walker, Wylie).
