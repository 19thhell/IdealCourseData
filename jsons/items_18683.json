Interdisciplinary and Flexible   Answering these and related questions requires a firm foundation in science and engineering on the one hand, and humanities and social sciences on the other. Following individualized courses of study and collaboration with faculty mentors, Science and Technology Studies majors dig beneath the headlines to understand the relations among science, technology, and society.   The Science and Technology Studies curriculum falls into four broad categories: general education (40 credits), science or engineering courses (28 credits), science and technology studies courses (34 credits), and free electives (18 credits). A student can combine a core of scientific or technical courses along with the analysis of those fields from an STS perspectives. The free electives are used as a student pleases, either to increase the depth of the science/engineering core, to take advantage of cross-school minors with NYU, or to study abroad.   Foundation for the Future   For students who plan to continue their education beyond the bachelor&#39;s degree, Science and Technology Studies makes an excellent preprofessional degree.      There are more than twice the number of applicants to medical schools as there are available seats. The MCAT exam, for entrance into medical school, is expanding its scope, and students will be expected to understand more than the science of medicine. Using Science and Technology Studies as a prehealth degree gives you the flexibility to do just that.    For students heading to law school, Science and Technology Studies is an attractive prelaw option. Lawyers with expertise in science or engineering are in demand to practice cases with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Lawyers are also increasingly asked to deal with scientific and technical matters in their practice, and the STS degree helps students prepare to understand and explain technical matters that come before them.     Not all Science and Technology students go on to law or medical school -- they are also qualified to work in public health, conduct laboratory research, work as a science journalist, or pursue advanced study in the history and philosophy of science and technology.

Please note: some students substitute EG 1003 for a different science course, following the practice of the department that regulates their Technology/Science concentration.

Lawyers are also increasingly asked to deal with scientific and technical matters in their practice, and the STS degree helps students prepare to understand and explain technical matters that come before them.     Not all Science and Technology students go on to law or medical school -- they are also qualified to work in public health, conduct laboratory research, work as a science journalist, or pursue advanced study in the history and philosophy of science and technology.
