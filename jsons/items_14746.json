Corporations and Transparency: Improving Consumer Markets and Increasing Public Accountability In \"Transparency in Politics and the Media: Accountability and Open Government,\" Nigel Bowles, James T. Hamilton, David A. Lev, eds. I.B. Tauris/Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. View/Download    Abstract    From cuneiform to card catalogs, people have always recorded data. But now we have tools to collect information faster than ever before. The proliferation of data includes statistics collected by governments about the economy, such as unemployment data or data that we supply on our tax returns and patent filings. When the media refer to the era of \u201cBig Data,\u201d they are including the vast amounts of information we also passively generate. Our mobile phones and cars contain sensors to track and report our location, position, acceleration, and temperature. The smart meters in our homes reveal when we turn on the heat or hot water. Companies increasingly gather data about our shopping and web browsing habits. The world\u2019s storehouse of digital information is growing at the rate of five trillion bits per second.      What is revolutionary is not only the quantity of data but also how we can use computers to search, sort, compare, aggregate, visualize, and track data. This kind of analysis can help us understand more about ourselves, our communities, and our environment, realizing the benefits of what has been called the quantified self and community. But these benefits can only be realized if data are available in a form that computers can ingest and process. Data must be open \u2013freely accessible and computable. When data are open, anyone can create sophisticated visualizations, models and analyses as well as spot mistakes or mix and mash across datasets to yield new insights.

Information for Impact: Liberating Nonprofit Sector Data Aspen Institute (January 2013) View/Download Report    Abstract    This report addresses the challenges to obtaining better, more usable data about the nonprofit sector to match the sector\u2019s growing importance. In 2010, there were 1.5 million tax-exempt organizations in the United States with $1.51 trillion in revenues. Through the Form 990 in its several varieties, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gathers and publishes a large amount of information about tax-exempt organizations. Over time, versions of the Form 990 have evolved that collect information on governance, investments, and other factors not directly related to an organization\u2019s tax calculations or qualifications for tax exemption. Copies of these returns are available one at a time from the filers or from other sources. The IRS creates image files of Form 990 returns and sells compilationsof them to the subscribing public for a fee. Several institutions, particularly GuideStar, the Foundation Center, and the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) at the Urban Institute, use this IRS data to analyze and present information about individual nonprofits and about the sector as a whole.      Like other important data collected by governments, information contained in the 990s could potentially be far more useful if it were not only public but \u201copen\u201d data. Open data are data that are available to all, free of charge, in a standard format, published without proprietary conditions, and available online as a bulk download rather than only through single-entry lookup. Making the Form 990 data truly open in this sense would not only make it easier to use for the organizations that already process it, but would also make it useful to researchers, advocates, entrepreneurs, technologists, and nonprofits that do not have the resources to use the data in its current form. We argue that open 990 data may increase transparency for nonprofit organizations, making it easier for state and federal authorities to detect fraud, spur innovation in the nonprofit sector and, above all, help us to understand the potential value of the 990 data.       2012      Noveck, Beth 2012.  Open Data \u2013 The Democratic Imperative Crooked Timber View Online    Abstract    Open Data are the basis for government innovation. This isn\u2019t because open data make government more transparent or accountable. Like Tom Slee , I have serious doubts about whether it does either of those things. In any event, shining a light on the misdeeds of ineffective institutions isn\u2019t as imperative as redesigning how they work. Instead, open data can provide the raw material to convene informed conversations inside and outside institutions about what\u2019s broken and the empirical foundation for developing solutions together.        The ability of third parties to participate is what makes open data truly transformative. The organization that collects and maintains information is not always in the exclusive position to use it well. For example, US regulators have compiled hospital infection rates for a long time. Accessible only to government professionals, they had limited resources to make adequate use of the information. When HHS made the data publicly available by publishing the data online in a computable format, then Microsoft and Google were able to mash up that information with mapping data to create search engine s that allow anyone \u2013 from the investigative journalist to the parent of the sick child\u2014to decide which hospital to choose (or whether it is safer to stay home). When data are open\u2014namely legally and technically accessible and capable of being machine processed \u2013 those with technical know how can create sophisticated and useful tools, visualizations, models and analysis as well as spot mistakes or mix and mash across datasets to yield insights. As Matt Parker, put it: \u201cBy making data open, you enable others to bring fresh perspectives, insights, and additional resources to your data, and that\u2019s when it can become really valuable.\u201d       2011      Noveck, Beth 2011.  Evolving Democracy for the 21st Century Huffington Post View Article Online    Abstract    In groups people can accomplish what they cannot do alone. Now new visual and social technologies are making it possible for people to make decisions and solve complex problems collectively. These technologies are enabling groups not only to create community but also to   wield power and create rules to govern their own affairs. Electronic democracy theorists have either focused on the individual and the state, disregarding the collaborative nature of public life,   or they remain wedded to out-dated and unrealistic conceptions of deliberation. This Article makes two central claims. First, technology will enable more effective forms of collective action. This is   particularly so of the emerging tools for \u201ccollective visualization\u201d which will profoundly reshape the ability of people to make decisions, own and dispose of assets, organize, protest, deliberate,   dissent and resolve disputes together. From this argument derives a second, normative claim. We should explore ways to structure the law to defer political and legal decisionmaking downward to   decentralized group-based decisionmaking. This argument about groups expands upon previous theories of law that recognize a center of power independent of central government: namely, the   corporation. If we take seriously the potential impact of technology on collective action, we ought to think about what it means to give groups body as well as soul \u2013 to \u201cincorporate\u201d them. The   Article rejects the anti-group arguments of Sunstein, Posner and Netanel and argues for the potential to realize legitimate self-governance at a \u201clower\u201d and more democratic level. The law has a central role to play in empowering active citizens to take part in this new form of democracy.            Noveck, Beth 2011.  What's in a Name?

Wiki Government: How Technology Can Make Government Better, Democracy Stronger, and Citizens More Powerful Brookings Press (2009), Russian (2012), Chinese (2011), Arabic (2011), Audio Book (2011) View Book Online    Abstract    Wiki Government shows how to bring innovation to government. In explaining how to enhance political institutions with the power of networks, it offers a fundamental rethinking of democracy in the digital age. Collaborative democracy-government of the people, by the people, for the people-is an old dream. Today, Wiki Government shows how technology can make that dream a reality. In this thought-provoking book, Beth Simone Noveck illustrates how collaborative democracy strengthens public decisionmaking by connecting the power of the many to the work of the few. Equally important, she provides a step-by-step demonstration of how collaborative democracy can be designed, opening policymaking to greater participation. \"Wiki Government\" tells the story behind one of the most dramatic public sector innovations in recent years - inviting the public to participate in the patent examination process. Patent examiners usually work in secret, cut off from essential information and racing against the clock to master arcane technical claims. The Peer-to-Patent project radically transformed this process by allowing anyone with Internet access to collaborate with the agency in reviewing patent applications. \"Wiki Government\" describes how a far-flung team of technologists, lawyers, and policymakers pried open a tradition-bound agency's doors. Noveck explains how she brought both fiercely competitive companies and risk-averse bureaucrats on board. She discusses the design challenges the team faced in creating software to distill online collaboration into useful expertise, not just rants or raves. And she explains how law, policy, and technology can be revamped to help government work in more open and participatory ways in a wide range of policy arenas, including education and the environment.       2008      Noveck, Beth (selected chapters) 2008.  A Complex(ity) Strategy for Breaking the Environmental Logjam (with David R. Johnson), in Breaking the LogJam: An Environmental Law for the 21st Century NYU Environ. L. Rev. (Fall 2008)    Abstract    In this essay, we explore how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) might use technology to improve the agency's level of scientific expertise and to obtain useful information sooner to inform EPA policymaking. By creating a self-reinforcing collaboration between government and networked publics, new web-based tools could help produce change within government and without - namely governmental decisions informed by better data obtained through citizen participation and civic action coordinated with governmental priorities. The agency has the opportunity to help break the logjam of environmental policymaking by developing transparent and participatory mechanisms for expert citizen participation. The key insight is not to throw open the floodgates to undifferentiated public input, but to design group-based processes that enable online communities to collaborate on finding and vetting information for agencies.     2007      Noveck, Beth 2007.  Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education Journal of Legal Education, Volume 57, Number 1 View Online    Abstract    Law students are footnoting the publicly authored, online resource known as Wikipedia in their term papers. Courts have cited to Wikipedia in authoritative judicial opinions. Law professors are doing so in their journal articls. Yet some members of the legal and academic communities are up in arms, decrying the use of an encyclopedia that anyone can write and edit. To allow students to rely on an online resource that might contain mistakes encourages laziness and risks undermining the legitimacy of legal authority and professionalism.       2006      Noveck, Beth 2006.  Peer to Patent: Collective Intelligence and Intellectual Property Reform 20 Harv. J. L. Tech. 123    Abstract    The patent system is broken. The Constitution intended for patents to foster innovation and the promotion of progress in the useful arts. Instead, the Patent Office creates uncertainty and monopoly. Underpaid and overwhelmed examiners struggle under the burden of 350,000 applications per year and a mounting backlog of 600,000. Increasingly patents are approved for unmerited inventions. What if we could make it easier to ensure that only the most worthwhile inventions got twenty years of monopoly rights? What if we could offer a way to protect the inventor\u2019s investment while still safeguarding the marketplace of ideas from bad inventions? What if we could make informed decisions about scientifically complex problems before the fact, rather than trying to reform the system ex post? What if we could harness collective intelligence to replace bureaucracy? This Article argues that we should reform the patent system by re-designing the institution of patent examination. Our existing legal mechanisms for awarding the patent monopoly are constructed around the outdated assumption that only expert bureaucrats can produce dispassionate decisions in the public interest. Building upon what we have learned from online and off-line systems of collaboration, we can now use the tools available to combine the wisdom of expert scientific communities of practice with the legal determinations of a trained Patent Office staff.

The State of Play: Law and Virtual Worlds NYU Press, 2006 View Book Online    Abstract    The State of Play presents an essential first step in understanding how new digital worlds will change the future of our universe. Millions of people around the world inhabit virtual words: multiplayer online games where characters live, love, buy, trade, cheat, steal, and have every possible kind of adventure. Far more complicated and sophisticated than early video games, people now spend countless hours in virtual universes like Second Life and Star Wars Galaxies not to shoot space invaders but to create new identities, fall in love, build cities, make rules, and break them.      As digital worlds become increasingly powerful and lifelike, people will employ them for countless real-world purposes, including commerce, education, medicine, law enforcement, and military training. Inevitably, real-world law will regulate them. But should virtual worlds be fully integrated into our real-world legal system or should they be treated as separate jurisdictions with their own forms of dispute resolution? What rules should govern virtual communities? Should the law step in to protect property rights when virtual items are destroyed or stolen?      These questions, and many more, are considered in The State of Play , where legal experts, game designers, and policymakers explore the boundaries of free speech, intellectual property, and creativity in virtual worlds. The essays explore both the emergence of law in multiplayer online games and how we can use virtual worlds to study real-world social interactions and test real-world laws.

Trademark Law and the Social Construction of Trust: Creating the Legal Framework for On-Line Identity 83 Wash. U. L. Q. 1733    Abstract    The intellectual property system has fostered many debates, including recent ones, regarding how the system affects access to knowledge. Yet, before one can access, one must preserve. Two interconnected problems posed by the growth of online creation illustrate the predicament. First, unlike analog creations, important digital creations such as e-mails and word-processed documents are mediated and controlled by second parties. Thus, although these creations are core intellectual property, they are not treated as such. Service providers and software makers terminate or deny access to people\u2019s digital property all the time. In addition, when one dies, some service providers refuse to grant heirs access to this property. The uneven and unclear management of these creations means that society will lose access to perhaps the greatest chronicling of human experience ever. Accordingly, this Article investigates and sets forth the theoretical foundations to explain why and how society should preserve this property. In so doing the Article finds that a second problem, which can be understood as one of control, arises. This Article is the first in a series of works aimed at investigating the nature and extent of control one may have or exert over a work. As such, this Article begins the project by examining the normative theories behind creators\u2019, heirs\u2019, and society\u2019s interests in the works. All three groups have interests in preservation, but the basis for the claims differs. In addition, an examination of the theoretical basis for these claims shows that the nature of the attention economy in conjunction with labor- and persona-based property theories support the position that in life a creator has strong claims for control over her intangible creations. Yet, the Article finds that historical and literary theory combined with recent economic theory as advanced by Professors Brett Frischmann and Mark Lemley regarding spillovers\u2014positive externalities generated by access to ideas and information\u2014reveals two points. First, these views support the need for better preservation of digital intellectual property insofar as it is infrastructure and has the potential for spillover effects. Second, although the creator may be best placed to manage and exert control of the works at issue, once the creator dies, literary, historical, and economic theory show that the claims for control diminish if not vanish. The explication and implications of this second point are explored elsewhere. This Article lays the groundwork for seeing that creators may need and have powerful claims for access and control over their works but that these same claims are necessarily limited by an understanding of the nature of creation and creative systems. The dividing line falls between life and death. The life and death distinction that this Article offers seeks to balance creators\u2019 interests in control over a work and society\u2019s interests in fostering later expressions and creations of new works. This Article examines the life side of the line.     2005      Noveck, Beth and David R. Johnson 2005.  Society's Software Society's Software, 74 FORDHAM L.

It facilitates the expression that is the cornerstone of self-fulfillment and self-realization. It also serves to diffuse societal violence' by allowing for an airing of controversial opinions and diluting the ill effects of harmful speech. The First Amendment is credited with safeguarding the proverbial marketplace of ideas, and thereby facilitating an evolutionary process that allows good ideas to propagate. Scholars from Professor Alexander Meiklejohn to Professor Owen Fiss see free expression as a political freedom essential to democracy. Professor Jack Balkin argues that free speech secures the right of individuals to participate in the production and distribution of culture, not simply politics narrowly understood.      All are incorrect, at least in emphasis, to suggest that core First   Amendment goals revolve entirely around freedom for individuals to speak their own minds. In an era of computer networks and peer production technologies, we increasingly produce both democracy and culture collectively. The group, not the individual, is the central speech actor, the crucible where individual opinions are combined and refined, where the resulting group speech is translated into action and amplified by money.       2004      Noveck, Beth 2004.  \"Unchat: Democratic Solution for a Wired World\" in Democracy Online: The Prospects for Democratic Renewal Through the Internet Peter Shane, ed.,(2004) View Online    Abstract    Taking a multidisciplinary approach that they identify as a \"cyber-realist research agenda,\" the contributors to this volume examine the prospects for electronic democracy in terms of its form and practice--while avoiding the pitfall of treating the benefits of electronic democracy as being self-evident.

Corporations and Transparency: Improving Consumer Markets and Increasing Public Accountability In \"Transparency in Politics and the Media: Accountability and Open Government,\" Nigel Bowles, James T. Hamilton, David A. Lev, eds. I.B. Tauris/Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. View/Download    Abstract    From cuneiform to card catalogs, people have always recorded data. But now we have tools to collect information faster than ever before. The proliferation of data includes statistics collected by governments about the economy, such as unemployment data or data that we supply on our tax returns and patent filings. When the media refer to the era of \u201cBig Data,\u201d they are including the vast amounts of information we also passively generate. Our mobile phones and cars contain sensors to track and report our location, position, acceleration, and temperature. The smart meters in our homes reveal when we turn on the heat or hot water. Companies increasingly gather data about our shopping and web browsing habits. The world\u2019s storehouse of digital information is growing at the rate of five trillion bits per second.      What is revolutionary is not only the quantity of data but also how we can use computers to search, sort, compare, aggregate, visualize, and track data. This kind of analysis can help us understand more about ourselves, our communities, and our environment, realizing the benefits of what has been called the quantified self and community. But these benefits can only be realized if data are available in a form that computers can ingest and process. Data must be open \u2013freely accessible and computable. When data are open, anyone can create sophisticated visualizations, models and analyses as well as spot mistakes or mix and mash across datasets to yield new insights.

Information for Impact: Liberating Nonprofit Sector Data Aspen Institute (January 2013) View/Download Report    Abstract    This report addresses the challenges to obtaining better, more usable data about the nonprofit sector to match the sector\u2019s growing importance. In 2010, there were 1.5 million tax-exempt organizations in the United States with $1.51 trillion in revenues. Through the Form 990 in its several varieties, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gathers and publishes a large amount of information about tax-exempt organizations. Over time, versions of the Form 990 have evolved that collect information on governance, investments, and other factors not directly related to an organization\u2019s tax calculations or qualifications for tax exemption. Copies of these returns are available one at a time from the filers or from other sources. The IRS creates image files of Form 990 returns and sells compilationsof them to the subscribing public for a fee. Several institutions, particularly GuideStar, the Foundation Center, and the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) at the Urban Institute, use this IRS data to analyze and present information about individual nonprofits and about the sector as a whole.      Like other important data collected by governments, information contained in the 990s could potentially be far more useful if it were not only public but \u201copen\u201d data. Open data are data that are available to all, free of charge, in a standard format, published without proprietary conditions, and available online as a bulk download rather than only through single-entry lookup. Making the Form 990 data truly open in this sense would not only make it easier to use for the organizations that already process it, but would also make it useful to researchers, advocates, entrepreneurs, technologists, and nonprofits that do not have the resources to use the data in its current form. We argue that open 990 data may increase transparency for nonprofit organizations, making it easier for state and federal authorities to detect fraud, spur innovation in the nonprofit sector and, above all, help us to understand the potential value of the 990 data.       2012      Noveck, Beth 2012.  Open Data \u2013 The Democratic Imperative Crooked Timber View Online    Abstract    Open Data are the basis for government innovation. This isn\u2019t because open data make government more transparent or accountable. Like Tom Slee , I have serious doubts about whether it does either of those things. In any event, shining a light on the misdeeds of ineffective institutions isn\u2019t as imperative as redesigning how they work. Instead, open data can provide the raw material to convene informed conversations inside and outside institutions about what\u2019s broken and the empirical foundation for developing solutions together.        The ability of third parties to participate is what makes open data truly transformative. The organization that collects and maintains information is not always in the exclusive position to use it well. For example, US regulators have compiled hospital infection rates for a long time. Accessible only to government professionals, they had limited resources to make adequate use of the information. When HHS made the data publicly available by publishing the data online in a computable format, then Microsoft and Google were able to mash up that information with mapping data to create search engine s that allow anyone \u2013 from the investigative journalist to the parent of the sick child\u2014to decide which hospital to choose (or whether it is safer to stay home). When data are open\u2014namely legally and technically accessible and capable of being machine processed \u2013 those with technical know how can create sophisticated and useful tools, visualizations, models and analysis as well as spot mistakes or mix and mash across datasets to yield insights. As Matt Parker, put it: \u201cBy making data open, you enable others to bring fresh perspectives, insights, and additional resources to your data, and that\u2019s when it can become really valuable.\u201d       2011      Noveck, Beth 2011.  Evolving Democracy for the 21st Century Huffington Post View Article Online    Abstract    In groups people can accomplish what they cannot do alone. Now new visual and social technologies are making it possible for people to make decisions and solve complex problems collectively. These technologies are enabling groups not only to create community but also to   wield power and create rules to govern their own affairs. Electronic democracy theorists have either focused on the individual and the state, disregarding the collaborative nature of public life,   or they remain wedded to out-dated and unrealistic conceptions of deliberation. This Article makes two central claims. First, technology will enable more effective forms of collective action. This is   particularly so of the emerging tools for \u201ccollective visualization\u201d which will profoundly reshape the ability of people to make decisions, own and dispose of assets, organize, protest, deliberate,   dissent and resolve disputes together. From this argument derives a second, normative claim. We should explore ways to structure the law to defer political and legal decisionmaking downward to   decentralized group-based decisionmaking. This argument about groups expands upon previous theories of law that recognize a center of power independent of central government: namely, the   corporation. If we take seriously the potential impact of technology on collective action, we ought to think about what it means to give groups body as well as soul \u2013 to \u201cincorporate\u201d them. The   Article rejects the anti-group arguments of Sunstein, Posner and Netanel and argues for the potential to realize legitimate self-governance at a \u201clower\u201d and more democratic level. The law has a central role to play in empowering active citizens to take part in this new form of democracy.            Noveck, Beth 2011.  What's in a Name?

Wiki Government: How Technology Can Make Government Better, Democracy Stronger, and Citizens More Powerful Brookings Press (2009), Russian (2012), Chinese (2011), Arabic (2011), Audio Book (2011) View Book Online    Abstract    Wiki Government shows how to bring innovation to government. In explaining how to enhance political institutions with the power of networks, it offers a fundamental rethinking of democracy in the digital age. Collaborative democracy-government of the people, by the people, for the people-is an old dream. Today, Wiki Government shows how technology can make that dream a reality. In this thought-provoking book, Beth Simone Noveck illustrates how collaborative democracy strengthens public decisionmaking by connecting the power of the many to the work of the few. Equally important, she provides a step-by-step demonstration of how collaborative democracy can be designed, opening policymaking to greater participation. \"Wiki Government\" tells the story behind one of the most dramatic public sector innovations in recent years - inviting the public to participate in the patent examination process. Patent examiners usually work in secret, cut off from essential information and racing against the clock to master arcane technical claims. The Peer-to-Patent project radically transformed this process by allowing anyone with Internet access to collaborate with the agency in reviewing patent applications. \"Wiki Government\" describes how a far-flung team of technologists, lawyers, and policymakers pried open a tradition-bound agency's doors. Noveck explains how she brought both fiercely competitive companies and risk-averse bureaucrats on board. She discusses the design challenges the team faced in creating software to distill online collaboration into useful expertise, not just rants or raves. And she explains how law, policy, and technology can be revamped to help government work in more open and participatory ways in a wide range of policy arenas, including education and the environment.       2008      Noveck, Beth (selected chapters) 2008.  A Complex(ity) Strategy for Breaking the Environmental Logjam (with David R. Johnson), in Breaking the LogJam: An Environmental Law for the 21st Century NYU Environ. L. Rev. (Fall 2008)    Abstract    In this essay, we explore how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) might use technology to improve the agency's level of scientific expertise and to obtain useful information sooner to inform EPA policymaking. By creating a self-reinforcing collaboration between government and networked publics, new web-based tools could help produce change within government and without - namely governmental decisions informed by better data obtained through citizen participation and civic action coordinated with governmental priorities. The agency has the opportunity to help break the logjam of environmental policymaking by developing transparent and participatory mechanisms for expert citizen participation. The key insight is not to throw open the floodgates to undifferentiated public input, but to design group-based processes that enable online communities to collaborate on finding and vetting information for agencies.     2007      Noveck, Beth 2007.  Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education Journal of Legal Education, Volume 57, Number 1 View Online    Abstract    Law students are footnoting the publicly authored, online resource known as Wikipedia in their term papers. Courts have cited to Wikipedia in authoritative judicial opinions. Law professors are doing so in their journal articls. Yet some members of the legal and academic communities are up in arms, decrying the use of an encyclopedia that anyone can write and edit. To allow students to rely on an online resource that might contain mistakes encourages laziness and risks undermining the legitimacy of legal authority and professionalism.       2006      Noveck, Beth 2006.  Peer to Patent: Collective Intelligence and Intellectual Property Reform 20 Harv. J. L. Tech. 123    Abstract    The patent system is broken. The Constitution intended for patents to foster innovation and the promotion of progress in the useful arts. Instead, the Patent Office creates uncertainty and monopoly. Underpaid and overwhelmed examiners struggle under the burden of 350,000 applications per year and a mounting backlog of 600,000. Increasingly patents are approved for unmerited inventions. What if we could make it easier to ensure that only the most worthwhile inventions got twenty years of monopoly rights? What if we could offer a way to protect the inventor\u2019s investment while still safeguarding the marketplace of ideas from bad inventions? What if we could make informed decisions about scientifically complex problems before the fact, rather than trying to reform the system ex post? What if we could harness collective intelligence to replace bureaucracy? This Article argues that we should reform the patent system by re-designing the institution of patent examination. Our existing legal mechanisms for awarding the patent monopoly are constructed around the outdated assumption that only expert bureaucrats can produce dispassionate decisions in the public interest. Building upon what we have learned from online and off-line systems of collaboration, we can now use the tools available to combine the wisdom of expert scientific communities of practice with the legal determinations of a trained Patent Office staff. The patent system is broken. The Constitution intended for patents to foster innovation and the promotion of progress in the useful arts. Instead, the Patent Office creates uncertainty and monopoly. Underpaid and overwhelmed examiners struggle under the burden of 350,000 applications per year and a mounting backlog of 600,000. Increasingly patents are approved for unmerited inventions. What if we could make it easier to ensure that only the most worthwhile inventions got twenty years of monopoly rights? What if we could offer a way to protect the inventor\u2019s investment while still safeguarding the marketplace of ideas from bad inventions? What if we could make informed decisions about scientifically complex problems before the fact, rather than trying to reform the system ex post?

Balkin, Jack M. and Beth S. Noveck, eds. 2006.  The State of Play: Law and Virtual Worlds NYU Press, 2006 View Book Online    Abstract    The State of Play presents an essential first step in understanding how new digital worlds will change the future of our universe. Millions of people around the world inhabit virtual words: multiplayer online games where characters live, love, buy, trade, cheat, steal, and have every possible kind of adventure. Far more complicated and sophisticated than early video games, people now spend countless hours in virtual universes like Second Life and Star Wars Galaxies not to shoot space invaders but to create new identities, fall in love, build cities, make rules, and break them.      As digital worlds become increasingly powerful and lifelike, people will employ them for countless real-world purposes, including commerce, education, medicine, law enforcement, and military training. Inevitably, real-world law will regulate them. But should virtual worlds be fully integrated into our real-world legal system or should they be treated as separate jurisdictions with their own forms of dispute resolution? What rules should govern virtual communities? Should the law step in to protect property rights when virtual items are destroyed or stolen?      These questions, and many more, are considered in The State of Play , where legal experts, game designers, and policymakers explore the boundaries of free speech, intellectual property, and creativity in virtual worlds. The essays explore both the emergence of law in multiplayer online games and how we can use virtual worlds to study real-world social interactions and test real-world laws.

Trademark Law and the Social Construction of Trust: Creating the Legal Framework for On-Line Identity 83 Wash. U. L. Q. 1733    Abstract    The intellectual property system has fostered many debates, including recent ones, regarding how the system affects access to knowledge. Yet, before one can access, one must preserve. Two interconnected problems posed by the growth of online creation illustrate the predicament. First, unlike analog creations, important digital creations such as e-mails and word-processed documents are mediated and controlled by second parties. Thus, although these creations are core intellectual property, they are not treated as such. Service providers and software makers terminate or deny access to people\u2019s digital property all the time. In addition, when one dies, some service providers refuse to grant heirs access to this property. The uneven and unclear management of these creations means that society will lose access to perhaps the greatest chronicling of human experience ever. Accordingly, this Article investigates and sets forth the theoretical foundations to explain why and how society should preserve this property. In so doing the Article finds that a second problem, which can be understood as one of control, arises. This Article is the first in a series of works aimed at investigating the nature and extent of control one may have or exert over a work. As such, this Article begins the project by examining the normative theories behind creators\u2019, heirs\u2019, and society\u2019s interests in the works. All three groups have interests in preservation, but the basis for the claims differs. In addition, an examination of the theoretical basis for these claims shows that the nature of the attention economy in conjunction with labor- and persona-based property theories support the position that in life a creator has strong claims for control over her intangible creations. Yet, the Article finds that historical and literary theory combined with recent economic theory as advanced by Professors Brett Frischmann and Mark Lemley regarding spillovers\u2014positive externalities generated by access to ideas and information\u2014reveals two points. First, these views support the need for better preservation of digital intellectual property insofar as it is infrastructure and has the potential for spillover effects. Second, although the creator may be best placed to manage and exert control of the works at issue, once the creator dies, literary, historical, and economic theory show that the claims for control diminish if not vanish. The explication and implications of this second point are explored elsewhere. This Article lays the groundwork for seeing that creators may need and have powerful claims for access and control over their works but that these same claims are necessarily limited by an understanding of the nature of creation and creative systems. The dividing line falls between life and death. The life and death distinction that this Article offers seeks to balance creators\u2019 interests in control over a work and society\u2019s interests in fostering later expressions and creations of new works. This Article examines the life side of the line.     2005      Noveck, Beth and David R. Johnson 2005.  Society's Software Society's Software, 74 FORDHAM L. REV 101 (2005) Download Publication    Abstract    The First Amendment serves many purposes both individual and social.   It facilitates the expression that is the cornerstone of self-fulfillment and self-realization. It also serves to diffuse societal violence' by allowing for an airing of controversial opinions and diluting the ill effects of harmful speech. The First Amendment is credited with safeguarding the proverbial marketplace of ideas, and thereby facilitating an evolutionary process that allows good ideas to propagate. Scholars from Professor Alexander Meiklejohn to Professor Owen Fiss see free expression as a political freedom essential to democracy. Professor Jack Balkin argues that free speech secures the right of individuals to participate in the production and distribution of culture, not simply politics narrowly understood.      All are incorrect, at least in emphasis, to suggest that core First   Amendment goals revolve entirely around freedom for individuals to speak their own minds. In an era of computer networks and peer production technologies, we increasingly produce both democracy and culture collectively. The group, not the individual, is the central speech actor, the crucible where individual opinions are combined and refined, where the resulting group speech is translated into action and amplified by money.       2004      Noveck, Beth 2004.  \"Unchat: Democratic Solution for a Wired World\" in Democracy Online: The Prospects for Democratic Renewal Through the Internet Peter Shane, ed.,(2004) View Online    Abstract    Taking a multidisciplinary approach that they identify as a \"cyber-realist research agenda,\" the contributors to this volume examine the prospects for electronic democracy in terms of its form and practice--while avoiding the pitfall of treating the benefits of electronic democracy as being self-evident.

Corporations and Transparency: Improving Consumer Markets and Increasing Public Accountability In \"Transparency in Politics and the Media: Accountability and Open Government,\" Nigel Bowles, James T. Hamilton, David A. Lev, eds. I.B. Tauris/Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. View/Download    Abstract    From cuneiform to card catalogs, people have always recorded data. But now we have tools to collect information faster than ever before. The proliferation of data includes statistics collected by governments about the economy, such as unemployment data or data that we supply on our tax returns and patent filings. When the media refer to the era of \u201cBig Data,\u201d they are including the vast amounts of information we also passively generate. Our mobile phones and cars contain sensors to track and report our location, position, acceleration, and temperature. The smart meters in our homes reveal when we turn on the heat or hot water. Companies increasingly gather data about our shopping and web browsing habits. The world\u2019s storehouse of digital information is growing at the rate of five trillion bits per second.      What is revolutionary is not only the quantity of data but also how we can use computers to search, sort, compare, aggregate, visualize, and track data. This kind of analysis can help us understand more about ourselves, our communities, and our environment, realizing the benefits of what has been called the quantified self and community. But these benefits can only be realized if data are available in a form that computers can ingest and process. Data must be open \u2013freely accessible and computable. When data are open, anyone can create sophisticated visualizations, models and analyses as well as spot mistakes or mix and mash across datasets to yield new insights.

In 2010, there were 1.5 million tax-exempt organizations in the United States with $1.51 trillion in revenues. Through the Form 990 in its several varieties, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gathers and publishes a large amount of information about tax-exempt organizations. Over time, versions of the Form 990 have evolved that collect information on governance, investments, and other factors not directly related to an organization\u2019s tax calculations or qualifications for tax exemption. Copies of these returns are available one at a time from the filers or from other sources. The IRS creates image files of Form 990 returns and sells compilationsof them to the subscribing public for a fee. Several institutions, particularly GuideStar, the Foundation Center, and the National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) at the Urban Institute, use this IRS data to analyze and present information about individual nonprofits and about the sector as a whole.      Like other important data collected by governments, information contained in the 990s could potentially be far more useful if it were not only public but \u201copen\u201d data. Open data are data that are available to all, free of charge, in a standard format, published without proprietary conditions, and available online as a bulk download rather than only through single-entry lookup. Making the Form 990 data truly open in this sense would not only make it easier to use for the organizations that already process it, but would also make it useful to researchers, advocates, entrepreneurs, technologists, and nonprofits that do not have the resources to use the data in its current form. We argue that open 990 data may increase transparency for nonprofit organizations, making it easier for state and federal authorities to detect fraud, spur innovation in the nonprofit sector and, above all, help us to understand the potential value of the 990 data.       2012      Noveck, Beth 2012.  Open Data \u2013 The Democratic Imperative Crooked Timber View Online    Abstract    Open Data are the basis for government innovation. This isn\u2019t because open data make government more transparent or accountable. Like Tom Slee , I have serious doubts about whether it does either of those things. In any event, shining a light on the misdeeds of ineffective institutions isn\u2019t as imperative as redesigning how they work. Instead, open data can provide the raw material to convene informed conversations inside and outside institutions about what\u2019s broken and the empirical foundation for developing solutions together.        The ability of third parties to participate is what makes open data truly transformative. The organization that collects and maintains information is not always in the exclusive position to use it well. For example, US regulators have compiled hospital infection rates for a long time. Accessible only to government professionals, they had limited resources to make adequate use of the information. When HHS made the data publicly available by publishing the data online in a computable format, then Microsoft and Google were able to mash up that information with mapping data to create search engine s that allow anyone \u2013 from the investigative journalist to the parent of the sick child\u2014to decide which hospital to choose (or whether it is safer to stay home). When data are open\u2014namely legally and technically accessible and capable of being machine processed \u2013 those with technical know how can create sophisticated and useful tools, visualizations, models and analysis as well as spot mistakes or mix and mash across datasets to yield insights. As Matt Parker, put it: \u201cBy making data open, you enable others to bring fresh perspectives, insights, and additional resources to your data, and that\u2019s when it can become really valuable.\u201d       2011      Noveck, Beth 2011.  Evolving Democracy for the 21st Century Huffington Post View Article Online    Abstract    In groups people can accomplish what they cannot do alone. Now new visual and social technologies are making it possible for people to make decisions and solve complex problems collectively. These technologies are enabling groups not only to create community but also to   wield power and create rules to govern their own affairs. Electronic democracy theorists have either focused on the individual and the state, disregarding the collaborative nature of public life,   or they remain wedded to out-dated and unrealistic conceptions of deliberation. This Article makes two central claims. First, technology will enable more effective forms of collective action. This is   particularly so of the emerging tools for \u201ccollective visualization\u201d which will profoundly reshape the ability of people to make decisions, own and dispose of assets, organize, protest, deliberate,   dissent and resolve disputes together. From this argument derives a second, normative claim. We should explore ways to structure the law to defer political and legal decisionmaking downward to   decentralized group-based decisionmaking. This argument about groups expands upon previous theories of law that recognize a center of power independent of central government: namely, the   corporation. If we take seriously the potential impact of technology on collective action, we ought to think about what it means to give groups body as well as soul \u2013 to \u201cincorporate\u201d them. The   Article rejects the anti-group arguments of Sunstein, Posner and Netanel and argues for the potential to realize legitimate self-governance at a \u201clower\u201d and more democratic level. The law has a central role to play in empowering active citizens to take part in this new form of democracy.            Noveck, Beth 2011.  What's in a Name?

Wiki Government: How Technology Can Make Government Better, Democracy Stronger, and Citizens More Powerful Brookings Press (2009), Russian (2012), Chinese (2011), Arabic (2011), Audio Book (2011) View Book Online    Abstract    Wiki Government shows how to bring innovation to government. In explaining how to enhance political institutions with the power of networks, it offers a fundamental rethinking of democracy in the digital age. Collaborative democracy-government of the people, by the people, for the people-is an old dream. Today, Wiki Government shows how technology can make that dream a reality. In this thought-provoking book, Beth Simone Noveck illustrates how collaborative democracy strengthens public decisionmaking by connecting the power of the many to the work of the few. Equally important, she provides a step-by-step demonstration of how collaborative democracy can be designed, opening policymaking to greater participation. \"Wiki Government\" tells the story behind one of the most dramatic public sector innovations in recent years - inviting the public to participate in the patent examination process. Patent examiners usually work in secret, cut off from essential information and racing against the clock to master arcane technical claims. The Peer-to-Patent project radically transformed this process by allowing anyone with Internet access to collaborate with the agency in reviewing patent applications. \"Wiki Government\" describes how a far-flung team of technologists, lawyers, and policymakers pried open a tradition-bound agency's doors. Noveck explains how she brought both fiercely competitive companies and risk-averse bureaucrats on board. She discusses the design challenges the team faced in creating software to distill online collaboration into useful expertise, not just rants or raves. And she explains how law, policy, and technology can be revamped to help government work in more open and participatory ways in a wide range of policy arenas, including education and the environment.       2008      Noveck, Beth (selected chapters) 2008.  A Complex(ity) Strategy for Breaking the Environmental Logjam (with David R. Johnson), in Breaking the LogJam: An Environmental Law for the 21st Century NYU Environ. L. Rev. (Fall 2008)    Abstract    In this essay, we explore how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) might use technology to improve the agency's level of scientific expertise and to obtain useful information sooner to inform EPA policymaking. By creating a self-reinforcing collaboration between government and networked publics, new web-based tools could help produce change within government and without - namely governmental decisions informed by better data obtained through citizen participation and civic action coordinated with governmental priorities. The agency has the opportunity to help break the logjam of environmental policymaking by developing transparent and participatory mechanisms for expert citizen participation. The key insight is not to throw open the floodgates to undifferentiated public input, but to design group-based processes that enable online communities to collaborate on finding and vetting information for agencies.     2007      Noveck, Beth 2007.  Wikipedia and the Future of Legal Education Journal of Legal Education, Volume 57, Number 1 View Online    Abstract    Law students are footnoting the publicly authored, online resource known as Wikipedia in their term papers. Courts have cited to Wikipedia in authoritative judicial opinions. Law professors are doing so in their journal articls. Yet some members of the legal and academic communities are up in arms, decrying the use of an encyclopedia that anyone can write and edit. To allow students to rely on an online resource that might contain mistakes encourages laziness and risks undermining the legitimacy of legal authority and professionalism.       2006      Noveck, Beth 2006.  Peer to Patent: Collective Intelligence and Intellectual Property Reform 20 Harv. J. L. Tech. 123    Abstract    The patent system is broken. The Constitution intended for patents to foster innovation and the promotion of progress in the useful arts. Instead, the Patent Office creates uncertainty and monopoly. Underpaid and overwhelmed examiners struggle under the burden of 350,000 applications per year and a mounting backlog of 600,000. Increasingly patents are approved for unmerited inventions. What if we could make it easier to ensure that only the most worthwhile inventions got twenty years of monopoly rights? What if we could offer a way to protect the inventor\u2019s investment while still safeguarding the marketplace of ideas from bad inventions? What if we could make informed decisions about scientifically complex problems before the fact, rather than trying to reform the system ex post? What if we could harness collective intelligence to replace bureaucracy? This Article argues that we should reform the patent system by re-designing the institution of patent examination. Our existing legal mechanisms for awarding the patent monopoly are constructed around the outdated assumption that only expert bureaucrats can produce dispassionate decisions in the public interest. Building upon what we have learned from online and off-line systems of collaboration, we can now use the tools available to combine the wisdom of expert scientific communities of practice with the legal determinations of a trained Patent Office staff.

The State of Play: Law and Virtual Worlds NYU Press, 2006 View Book Online    Abstract    The State of Play presents an essential first step in understanding how new digital worlds will change the future of our universe. Millions of people around the world inhabit virtual words: multiplayer online games where characters live, love, buy, trade, cheat, steal, and have every possible kind of adventure. Far more complicated and sophisticated than early video games, people now spend countless hours in virtual universes like Second Life and Star Wars Galaxies not to shoot space invaders but to create new identities, fall in love, build cities, make rules, and break them.      As digital worlds become increasingly powerful and lifelike, people will employ them for countless real-world purposes, including commerce, education, medicine, law enforcement, and military training. Inevitably, real-world law will regulate them. But should virtual worlds be fully integrated into our real-world legal system or should they be treated as separate jurisdictions with their own forms of dispute resolution? What rules should govern virtual communities? Should the law step in to protect property rights when virtual items are destroyed or stolen?      These questions, and many more, are considered in The State of Play , where legal experts, game designers, and policymakers explore the boundaries of free speech, intellectual property, and creativity in virtual worlds. The essays explore both the emergence of law in multiplayer online games and how we can use virtual worlds to study real-world social interactions and test real-world laws.

Trademark Law and the Social Construction of Trust: Creating the Legal Framework for On-Line Identity 83 Wash. U. L. Q. 1733    Abstract    The intellectual property system has fostered many debates, including recent ones, regarding how the system affects access to knowledge. Yet, before one can access, one must preserve. Two interconnected problems posed by the growth of online creation illustrate the predicament. First, unlike analog creations, important digital creations such as e-mails and word-processed documents are mediated and controlled by second parties. Thus, although these creations are core intellectual property, they are not treated as such. Service providers and software makers terminate or deny access to people\u2019s digital property all the time. In addition, when one dies, some service providers refuse to grant heirs access to this property. The uneven and unclear management of these creations means that society will lose access to perhaps the greatest chronicling of human experience ever. Accordingly, this Article investigates and sets forth the theoretical foundations to explain why and how society should preserve this property. In so doing the Article finds that a second problem, which can be understood as one of control, arises. This Article is the first in a series of works aimed at investigating the nature and extent of control one may have or exert over a work. As such, this Article begins the project by examining the normative theories behind creators\u2019, heirs\u2019, and society\u2019s interests in the works. All three groups have interests in preservation, but the basis for the claims differs. In addition, an examination of the theoretical basis for these claims shows that the nature of the attention economy in conjunction with labor- and persona-based property theories support the position that in life a creator has strong claims for control over her intangible creations. Yet, the Article finds that historical and literary theory combined with recent economic theory as advanced by Professors Brett Frischmann and Mark Lemley regarding spillovers\u2014positive externalities generated by access to ideas and information\u2014reveals two points. First, these views support the need for better preservation of digital intellectual property insofar as it is infrastructure and has the potential for spillover effects. Second, although the creator may be best placed to manage and exert control of the works at issue, once the creator dies, literary, historical, and economic theory show that the claims for control diminish if not vanish. The explication and implications of this second point are explored elsewhere. This Article lays the groundwork for seeing that creators may need and have powerful claims for access and control over their works but that these same claims are necessarily limited by an understanding of the nature of creation and creative systems. The dividing line falls between life and death. The life and death distinction that this Article offers seeks to balance creators\u2019 interests in control over a work and society\u2019s interests in fostering later expressions and creations of new works. This Article examines the life side of the line.     2005      Noveck, Beth and David R. Johnson 2005.  Society's Software Society's Software, 74 FORDHAM L. REV 101 (2005) Download Publication    Abstract    The First Amendment serves many purposes both individual and social.   It facilitates the expression that is the cornerstone of self-fulfillment and self-realization. It also serves to diffuse societal violence' by allowing for an airing of controversial opinions and diluting the ill effects of harmful speech. The First Amendment is credited with safeguarding the proverbial marketplace of ideas, and thereby facilitating an evolutionary process that allows good ideas to propagate. Scholars from Professor Alexander Meiklejohn to Professor Owen Fiss see free expression as a political freedom essential to democracy. Professor Jack Balkin argues that free speech secures the right of individuals to participate in the production and distribution of culture, not simply politics narrowly understood.      All are incorrect, at least in emphasis, to suggest that core First   Amendment goals revolve entirely around freedom for individuals to speak their own minds. In an era of computer networks and peer production technologies, we increasingly produce both democracy and culture collectively. The group, not the individual, is the central speech actor, the crucible where individual opinions are combined and refined, where the resulting group speech is translated into action and amplified by money.       2004      Noveck, Beth 2004.  \"Unchat: Democratic Solution for a Wired World\" in Democracy Online: The Prospects for Democratic Renewal Through the Internet Peter Shane, ed.,(2004) View Online    Abstract    Taking a multidisciplinary approach that they identify as a \"cyber-realist research agenda,\" the contributors to this volume examine the prospects for electronic democracy in terms of its form and practice--while avoiding the pitfall of treating the benefits of electronic democracy as being self-evident.
