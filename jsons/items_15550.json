The report is based on an extensive searchable online database constructed by a team of NYU law students supervised by Rodr\u00edguez and Muzaffar Chishti, the director of MPI's office at NYU. Over time, the database will grow to include all immigration-related bills introduced between 2001 and 2008.   The database classifies the bills by categories including geographic area, bill status, and whether the legislation in question contracts or expands immigrants' rights. \"The trend is clear,\" said Rodr\u00edguez. \"At a time when Congress has been unable to pass comprehensive immigration reform, states have become increasingly active on the legislative front and are introducing bills that touch on everything from law enforcement to housing, health care, and immigrant integration policies. This database offers an important window on the contours of the debate taking place in state legislatures across the nation.\"    MORE INFORMATION  Search the State Responses to Immigration database   Read the database's accompanying report   Read the press release about the database's launch   Read Cristina Rodr\u00edguez's faculty profile                                Law School News Search           &rsaquo;               @nyulaw on Twitter     In new @BrennanCenter book, 2016 candidates are united in call to alter #criminaljustice system: http://t.co/W0Xq1ZCGhj 3 hours ago RT @OnPointRadio : 'Hundreds of thousands of children have same-sex parents.
