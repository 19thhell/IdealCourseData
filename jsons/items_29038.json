My book projects and articles traverse several disciplines and interdisciplines, but one through-line is an abiding interest in exploring how feelings are lived, experienced, and communicated between and across bodies\u2014and with what risks and possibilities for self and others. Another is the value of the aesthetic for repairing democratic social life. These two lines of interest converge insofar as I am keenly interested in the kinds of practices that make and un-make worlds. In all my work, I proceed with feminist and queer angles of vision as a way to put pressure on normative schemas of embodiment and subjectivity and to illuminate the cross-currents of gender, race, sexuality, and religion as they shape and impress the embodied life of feeling. These crossing or contact points do not always feel good. Far from it. They can even be points of democratic\u2014and psychic\u2014conflict. Social conflicts over difference are a key concern in my co-authored book with Janet R. Jakobsen, Love the Sin: Sexual Regulation and the Limits of Religious Tolerance (2004). Love the Sin analyzes debates over religion and sexuality in the United States. We are particularly interested in how \u201creligion\u201d is invoked\u2014even by the secular U.S. state\u2014to manage and contain supposedly \u201cthreatening\u201d social differences. Another joint project with Jakobsen, the edited volume Secularisms (2008), works explicitly to de-center U.S. conceptions of secularism. Both Love the Sin and Secularisms share a desire to disrupt the Enlightenment narrative that equates secularism with modernity, reason, freedom, peace, and progress. This narrative too often produces a forced choice between \u201cconservative\u201d religion and \u201cprogressive\u201d secularism, a choice not unlike the one often forwarded by secular gender and sexuality studies: to wit, between \u201cbad\u201d religion and the \u201cgoods\u201d of sexual liberation. In our work together, Jakobsen and I have consistently argued against such false choices, moving instead to consider how practices of sexual and religious freedom can be theorized in tandem with, rather than in constant opposition to, one another. My new solo book, Excess & Enchantment , examines how public performances of sexuality and religion converge across a diverse archive of visual and performance art, musical theatre, religious protest, and public displays of mourning. Throughout, I draw on the interdisciplinary methods and questions of gender and sexuality studies, performance studies, affect studies, and psychoanalysis. I have a long-standing interest in psychoanalysis as a critical method for understanding interactions between individuals and their social contexts, self and other, and the inner and outer lives of feeling. But psychoanalysis is not just a diverse body of theory irreducible to the proper name Freud; it is also a critical and creative practice in its own right.

At its core, the undergraduate Program encourages students to question the meanings of \"male\" and \"female,\" as well as of sexual norms, in both Western and non-Western societies. Courses seek to unravel the ways in which ideas about gender and sexuality shape social roles and identities, in addition to the ways in which race, class, and ethnicity function in the experience of gender and sexuality within a culture. Gender and Sexuality Studies challenges the privileging of some categories (i.e., male or heterosexual) over others, along with the social and political implications of such hierarchies. Our curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis and seeks to complicate what is often presented as \"natural\" or \"normal\" in traditional academic curricula.    The Program offers an undergraduate major and a minor in Gender and Sexuality Studies, the requirements for which are set forth in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin. By its very nature, Gender and Sexuality Studies enables students to combine intellectual inquiry with lived experience. To this end, students are encouraged to participate in internship opportunities and independent studies. Through these initiatives, students gain professional experience as well as an opportunity to test lessons learned in the classroom.    Students come to Gender and Sexuality Studies with an intellectual curiosity about the ordering of society and questions about their relationship to it. Through critical inquiry and exposure to a broad range of political and historical situations, many students go on to careers in social work, government, law, and political advocacy, often pertaining to gender and sexuality issues.    Students seeking admission should apply to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York University, 22 Washington Square North, New York, NY 10011. The University sponsors and administers a wide variety of financial aid programs. Awards are based on the student's record of academic achievement and test scores as well as on financial need.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
