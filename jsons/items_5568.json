Financial Aid Resources for Occupational Therapy Students                   Through the Doctor of Professional Studies (D.P.S.) Program, students have the opportunity to advance their knowledge and critical thinking via coursework that builds a foundation of critical analysis, evidence-based practice, ethics, and theory. The D.P.S. prepares advanced, skilled occupational therapists to deliver, present, and collaborate with interdisciplinary professionals to provide high quality care. Students are offered two areas of advanced clinical specialization: pediatrics and upper quadrant.    Graduates of the program must complete 36 points of coursework and defend their professional portfolios. The program is designed for two years of full-time study. In the pediatrics specialization, students learn about the dimensions of occupational therapy practice in relation to: (1) social, cultural, and physical environments; (2) families, significant others, and caregivers; (3) and teams and their interactions. Students in the upper quadrant specialization study normal anatomy of the upper quadrant and clinical management of disorders, injuries, and illnesses of the upper quadrant.    Graduation requirements for the D.P.S. degree are (1) successful completion of 36 points of approved coursework with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00, (2) presentation and successful defense of evidence-based professional portfolio, (3) completion of all requirements for the D.P.S. within seven years.

At the completion of the D.P.S. degree, students will defend an evidence-based professional electronic portfolio (&ldquo;e-portfolio&rdquo;). The e-portfolio will document how the student has integrated knowledge and skills learned in the curriculum to his/her specialty practice area. The e-portfolio involves three steps:    First, students complete an analysis of their current practices to determine career goals consistent with their area of specialization.    Second, students use their academic coursework and clinical experience to collect &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; that demonstrate advancement of knowledge, skills, and abilities gained through the integrated academic and clinical work within the program.    Third, students organize and catalog their artifacts. In the final course, Professional Portfolio: Advanced Practice OT-GE 3310, students present their e-portfolio to a panel of three faculty members. Faculty review the e-portfolio based on the original, professional development plan and its consistency with the evidence-based knowledge in the field of inquiry.

We interviewed one of the first recipients of the DPS, Karen Roston, about her experiences in creating the professional portfolio and her path through occupational therapy education.        The Cost of Your Education    Current information about costs and tuition is available on the Office of Graduate Admissions website .    A variety of financial aid is available to students , including help with childcare expenses. Further information will be provided upon your acceptance into the program.    Financial Aid Resources for Occupational Therapy Students                   Through the Doctor of Professional Studies (D.P.S.) Program, students have the opportunity to advance their knowledge and critical thinking via coursework that builds a foundation of critical analysis, evidence-based practice, ethics, and theory. The D.P.S. prepares advanced, skilled occupational therapists to deliver, present, and collaborate with interdisciplinary professionals to provide high quality care. Students are offered two areas of advanced clinical specialization: pediatrics and upper quadrant.    Graduates of the program must complete 36 points of coursework and defend their professional portfolios. The program is designed for two years of full-time study. In the pediatrics specialization, students learn about the dimensions of occupational therapy practice in relation to: (1) social, cultural, and physical environments; (2) families, significant others, and caregivers; (3) and teams and their interactions. Students in the upper quadrant specialization study normal anatomy of the upper quadrant and clinical management of disorders, injuries, and illnesses of the upper quadrant.    Graduation requirements for the D.P.S. degree are (1) successful completion of 36 points of approved coursework with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.00, (2) presentation and successful defense of evidence-based professional portfolio, (3) completion of all requirements for the D.P.S. within seven years. For complete descriptions of the courses listed below, see D.P.S. Courses in Occupational Therapy .    Department Core Courses (9 points)       Theoretical Foundations for Intervention OT-GE 2762    Developing a Guideline for Intervention OT-GE 2763    Ethics and Analytical Reasoning OT-GE 2764       Program Requirements (6 points)       Evidence-Based Practice OT-GE 3301    Advanced Assessments for the Practicing Therapist OT-GE 3306       Electives (6 points)    Students are required to complete six points of electives in related fields to support their studies. In addition to departmental selections, students may select electives from university-wide offerings. Electives are selected under Advisement.    Clinical Specializations (12 points)    Occupational Therapy for Children specialization:       Contemporary Issues in Occupational Therapy: Developing Assistive Technology OT-GE 2900    Reframing the Meaning of Disability to Families OT-GE 2338    Treating Children with Sensory Regulatory Dysfunction OT-GE 2332    Successful Intervention in Schools OT-GE 2335       Upper Quadrant Disorder specialization:       Clinical Anatomy of the Upper Quadrant, Face, Neck, and Selected Cavities OT-GE 2801       Terminal Project (3 points)       Professional Portfolio: Advanced Practice OT-GE 3310. At the completion of the D.P.S. degree, students will defend an evidence-based professional electronic portfolio (&ldquo;e-portfolio&rdquo;). The e-portfolio will document how the student has integrated knowledge and skills learned in the curriculum to his/her specialty practice area. The e-portfolio involves three steps:    First, students complete an analysis of their current practices to determine career goals consistent with their area of specialization.    Second, students use their academic coursework and clinical experience to collect &ldquo;artifacts&rdquo; that demonstrate advancement of knowledge, skills, and abilities gained through the integrated academic and clinical work within the program.    Third, students organize and catalog their artifacts. In the final course, Professional Portfolio: Advanced Practice OT-GE 3310, students present their e-portfolio to a panel of three faculty members. Faculty review the e-portfolio based on the original, professional development plan and its consistency with the evidence-based knowledge in the field of inquiry.

These programs integrate the theoretical foundation of occupational therapy and the knowledge, clinical skills, and attitudes necessary for engaging in evidence-based practice.    Students develop analytical skills necessary for assuming leadership roles while cultivating a network of professional contacts through their coursework, clinical experiences, and collaborative studies. One of our most outstanding features is the large peer support network provided by our active cadre of post-professional students.    The agenda for scholarly inquiry in the department's post-professional program is to strengthen the applied body of knowledge of occupational therapy. The program achieves this through further development, refinement, and assessment of the effectiveness of evidence-based practice and directly related topical issues.
