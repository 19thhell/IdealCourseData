Here&#8217;s how to connect your devices:   NYU-NET   NYU&#8217;s main wireless network is an enterprise network, with a number of security limitations.

They must be able to connect using WPA2-Enterprise authentication\u00a0too.   Most consumer devices do not allow for WPA2-Enterprise authentication, so you won&#8217;t be testing devices on this network, for the most part. However, if you want to connect an Arduino Y\u00fan to the nyu SSID as a client, Karl Ward has posted instructions on how to do it .   Matt Richardson has written a useful page on\u00a0 getting on NYU-NET with a Raspberry Pi , though again, this works only as a client, not as a server. Before you get this to work you will have to install a WiFi adapter on your Pi. \u00a0Sergio Majluf has a shorter version, from the Pi command line . This should also work on a BeagleBone Black, though it has not yet been tested.   ITPSandbox   ITPSandbox is an experimental wireless network for development of new networked devices. Unlike the main NYU net, devices on itpsandbox can be both servers and clients. This is the network we&#8217;ll use for most device tests. This network is MAC address filtered, so your device needs to be registered in advance. Contact Marlon Evans to connect to itpsandbox. He&#8217;ll need to know what device it is you&#8217;re connecting, what its MAC address is.   NYU-Guest   The NYU Guest network is not encrypted, but features a captive portal to login. Like the main NYU net, this network only allows client activity, you can&#8217;t run a server on it. In order to login, a device has to make a HTTP request to the \u00a0form address embedded in the portal page with the login ID and that week&#8217;s password. While technically possible, the complexity of this is high enough to make it not worth using as an experimental net. Stick with sandbox.

When it comes to products, if it powers up, it talks to another device. There&#8217;s an increasing number of appliances coming on the market that feature web interfaces, but do they work well? This class take a hands-on critical look at the emerging market for connected devices, and will present an overview of methods for connecting the physical world to web-based applications. We don&#8217;t interact with connected appliances in the same way as we do when they&#8217;re not connected. It&#8217;s not enough just to bolt a touchscreen on an appliance and call it networked. In this course we&#8217;ll consider what the emerging interaction patterns are, if any, and we&#8217;ll develop some of our own as needed.   This class can be seen as a narrower and more interaction design-based complement to Understanding Networks. The latter class provides a broader overview of the dynamics of data networks, while this class focuses specifically on the challenges of connecting embedded devices to web-based services. Neither class is a prerequisite for the other, however.   The class will begin with a review of some existing connected devices on the market, in which we&#8217;ll critique them as products of interaction design. Then we&#8217;ll have several short exercises to introduce different tools, and a final hardware and software production project in which students develop a more fully realized networked device.   Prerequisites : Intro to Physical Computing, Comm Lab: Web, and Intro to Computational Media, or equivalent experience with the topics covered in those three classes.   General Structure:   We\u2019ll start each class with a review of any homework assignments, readings etc. Come prepared to present when you have an assignment due, and come having done the reading and prepared to discuss and ask questions when a reading has been assigned.   Following the homework/reading review, we\u2019ll discuss new material. This will cover both programming and design techniques as well as general topics related to the class. There will likely be one or two guest speakers, TBD.   Assignments:   There are several homework assignments that illustrate the technical topics. You should be prepared to show your project on any week in which an assignment is due.   Commenting on each others\u2019 work : When watching your classmates present their work in class, we\u2019ll make some time for verbal comments, but you should take written notes on their presentations and on their interaction with their intended user. Offer suggestions on what they do well and should continue doing, what they should stop doing, and what they could add to their work and/or their presentation to make it better. Give them these notes at the end of class, or comment on their project page online. You\u2019ll be getting the same notes from your classmates, so write in the same voice in which you\u2019d like to hear feedback on your own work.   Blog assignments are assigned throughout the course, on a variety of topics. They should be finished a day in advance of the day we will discuss them; in other words, if we\u2019re discussing them Wednesday, finish them by Tuesday. Unless otherwise stated, use the class blog, so we are all in the same place.   At the very least, you should have a page for each assignment. For the readings, if no one else has blogged it, start a new post. If there&#8217;s already a post, you can either comment on existing posts or add your own.   Read and comment on each other&#8217;s writings as well.

Review what we&#8217;ve covered, final questions and thoughts.         Grading     Participation &amp; Attendance: 40%   Production Assignments: 30%   Documentation/Blogging: 30%     Participation &amp; Attendance   Showing up on time, engaging in the class discussion, and offering advice and critique on other projects in the class is a major part of your grade. Please be present and prompt. Lateness will hurt your grade. If you&#8217;re going to be late or absent, please contact me in advance. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can. Please turn in assignments on time as well.   Laptops/Tablets   Laptop and tablet use is fine if you are using your laptop to present in class, or if we&#8217;re in the middle of an exercise that makes use of it. Whenever classmates are presenting or we&#8217;re in the midst of a class discussion, however, please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on the quality of your attention and active participation, so please respect that, close your lid, and pay attention.   Mobile Phones   Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class unless they are part of your project. If you have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please tell your instructor ahead of time.   Production Assignments   For production assignments, you&#8217;ll be expected to present your project in class on the day that it&#8217;s due. When you have an assignment or presentation due, show up to class on time. You may be called on first.   If you&#8217;re working in a group, all group members should be present, and should participate equally in the presentation.   For the group assignments, each group should assign a member to take responsibility for one or more aspect of the project, e.g. software/firmware, user interface, interaction, hardware, fabrication, documentation. You may want to break it down further than that, but those are good starting areas.   Being responsible for an area doesn\u2019t mean you are doing all the work in that area. It means that when a decision needs to be made in that area, you\u2019ll decide and communicate it to the others, and you\u2019ll all act on it accordingly. If things are lagging in that area, you should work with your group members to address the problem, and in the absence of other ideas, they\u2019ll look to you for a decision on how to proceed. It also means that in class presentations, you\u2019ll report on that area. Decide who\u2019s responsible for what early on, and post it to your group\u2019s project page, so the whole class knows.   Documentation   Use the class blog to record your progress. For reading assignments, respond to the reading in a blog post, and respond to each others\u2019 posts as well. \u00a0At the very least, make sure you\u2019ve read your classmates\u2019 posts before a reading assignment is due, so you can comment knowledgeably or ask questions of each other in class.   For production assignments, give each project a page, and update that page as needed. If you\u2019re keeping your documentation on an external site, make sure links to that external site are included and updated on your project page.
