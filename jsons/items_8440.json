Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9544 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU Madrid)  syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9548 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU Prague)  syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9549 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU London) The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Edelstein (NYU Florence) In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How   has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested   historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a   critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the   legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding   Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as   Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through   films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about   the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo   (2009). We also consider films that have employed innovative narrative   and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past   and the present such as Two Laws (1982) and The Tracker (2002).   Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts   of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers   have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched   detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples,   including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema   history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971)   as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first   feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived   interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood   (2008).

SPRING 2014  CORE -UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Palmer (NYU Florence)   syllabus  Through the study of primary texts, we examine how Italians registered their own similarities and differences within a national context, and how they regarded the tourists, students, soldiers, and immigrants who have come in increasing numbers to Italy. We also consider the accounts of foreign visitors to Italy from the eighteenth-century until today, both from the perspective of western tourists seeking \u201cculture\u201d and through the eyes of immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and beyond. The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city.

C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]},

At this time, England was linked to mainland Europe by a large land bridge. The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the Thames and the Seine. This area was greatly depopulated during the period of the last major ice age, as were other regions of the British Isles. In the subsequent recolonisation, after the thawing of the ice, genetic research shows that present-day England was the last area of the British Isles to be repopulated[14], circa 13,000 years ago. The migrants arriving during this period contrast with the other of the inhabitants of the British Isles, coming across land from the south east of Europe, whereas earlier arriving inhabitants came north along a coastal route from Iberia. These migrants would later adopt the Celtic culture that came to dominate much of western Europe.      Roman conquest of Britain      By AD 43, the time of the main Roman invasion of Britain, Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. Like other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans, and their economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. With the fall of the Roman empire 400 years later, the Romans left England.           Anglo-Saxon England       The History of Anglo-Saxon England covers the history of early mediaeval England from the end of Roman Britain and the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the fifth century until the Conquest by the Normans in 1066.Fragmentary knowledge of Anglo-Saxon England in the 5th and 6th centuries comes from the British writer Gildas (6th century) the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (a history of the English people begun in the 9th century), saints\u2019 lives, poetry, archaeological findings, and place-name studies.       The dominant themes of the seventh to tenth centuries were the spread of Christianity and the political unification of England. Christianity is thought to have come from three directions \u2014 from Rome to the south, and Scotland and Ireland to the north and west.Heptarchy is a term used to refer to the existence (as believed) of the seven petty kingdoms which eventually merged to become the Kingdom of England during the early 10th century: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Wessex.       The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms tended to coalesce by means of warfare. As early as the time of Ethelbert of Kent, one king could be recognised as Bretwalda (\u201cLord of Britain\u201d). Generally speaking, the title fell in the 7th century to the kings of Northumbria, in the eighth to those of Mercia, and finally, in the ninth, to Egbert of Wessex, who in 825 defeated the Mercians at the Battle of Ellendun. In the next century his family came to rule all England.       Kingdom of England       Originally, England (or Englaland) was a geographical term to describe the territory of Britain which was occupied by the Anglo-Saxons, rather than a name of an individual nation-state. It became politically united through the expansion of the kingdom of Wessex, whose king Athelstan brought the whole of England under one ruler for the first time in 927, although unification did not become permanent until 954. In 1016 England was conquered by the Danish king Canute the Great, and became the centre of government for his short-lived empire which also included Denmark and Norway. In 1042 England became a separate kingdom again with the accession of Edward the Confessor, heir of the native English dynasty.       The Kingdom of England (including Wales) continued to exist as an independent nation-state right through to the Acts of Union and the Union of Crowns. However the political ties and direction of England were changed forever by the Norman Conquest in 1066.       Norman Conquest       Kingdom of England by William the Conqueror (Duke of Normandy), in 1066 at the Battle of Hastings and the subsequent Norman control of England. It is an important watershed in English history for a number of reasons. The conquest linked England more closely with Continental Europe, and lessened Scandinavian influence. The success of the conquest established one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe, created the most sophisticated governmental system in Europe, changed the English language and culture, and set the stage for English-French conflict that would last into the nineteenth century.The events of the conquest also paved the way for a pivotal historical document to be produced - the Domesday Book. The Domesday Book was the record of the great survey of England completed in 1086, executed for William the Conqueror. The survey was similar to a census by a government of today and is England\u2019s earliest surviving public records document.       Medieval England       The next few hundred years saw England as an important part of expanding and dwindling empires based in France, with the \u201cKings of England\u201d using England as a source of troops to enlarge their personal holdings in France for many years (Hundred Years\u2019 War); in fact the English crown did not relinquish its last foothold on mainland France until Calais was lost during the reign of Mary Tudor (the Channel Islands are still crown dependencies, though not part of the UK).       The Principality of Wales, under the control of English monarchs from the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284, became part of the Kingdom of England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542. Wales shared a legal identity with England as the joint entity originally called England and later England and Wales.       An epidemic of catastrophic proportions, the Black Death first reached England in the summer of 1348. The Black Death is estimated to have killed between a third and two-thirds of Europe\u2019s population. England alone lost as many as 70% of its population, which passed from 7 million to 2 million in 1400. The plague repeatedly returned to haunt England throughout the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. The Great Plague of London in 1665\u20131666 was the last plague outbreak.           Reformation       During the English Reformation, the external authority of the Roman Catholic Church in England was abolished and replaced with Royal Supremacy and ultimately describes the establishment of a Church of England, outside the Roman Catholic Church, under the Supreme Governance of the English monarch. The English Reformation differed from its European counterparts in that it was a political, rather than purely theological, dispute at root.[16] The break with Rome started in the reign of Henry VIII.The English Reformation paved the way for the spread of Anglicanism in the church and other institutions.       English Civil War       Cromwell at Dunbar. Oliver Cromwell united the whole of the British Isles by force and created the Commonwealth of England.       The English Civil War was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations which took place between Parliamentarians and Royalists from 1642 until 1651. The first (1642\u20131645) and second (1648\u20131649) civil wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third war of (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The Civil War ended with the Parliamentary victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.       The Civil War led to the trial and execution of Charles I, the exile of his son Charles II and the replacement of the English monarchy with the Commonwealth of England (1649\u20131653) and then with a Protectorate (1653\u20131659): the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell. After a brief return to Commonwealth rule, in 1660 The Crown was restored and Charles II accepted Convention Parliament\u2019s invitation to return to England. During the interregnum the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship in England came to an end, and the victors consolidated the already-established Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. Constitutionally, the wars established a precedent that British monarchs could not govern without the consent of Parliament although this would not be cemented until the Glorious Revolution later in the century.          Great Britain and the United Kingdom       The Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland remained separate, until 1707, when under the Acts of Union, both England and Scotland lost their individual political (though not legal) identities. This union has subsequently changed its name twice; firstly on the merger with the Kingdom of Ireland following the Act of Union in 1800 creating the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. Then following the secession from the union of the Irish Free State under the terms of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, it became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Throughout these changes, England (including Wales) retained a separate legal identity from its partners, with a separate legal system (English law) from those in Northern Ireland (Northern Ireland law) and Scotland (Scots law), and eventually the strong feelings of the Welsh were acknowledged when it was decided that the name would henceforth be.

Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, ritual, belief, gender, individuality, and community. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9544 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Spain\u2014At the Crossroads of Europe, North Africa, and America Prof. Suarez-Galban (NYU Madrid)  syllabus Analyzes the ways in which historical, geopolitical, cultural, artistic, and popular views function to constitute and continuously transform a national culture. Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9548 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe Prof. Mucha (NYU Prague)  syllabus The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East, many scholars see a distinct Central European culture based on historical, social, and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity, the result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic, and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of history. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures, such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe, and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel, and Dvorak, to mention at least some. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of Prague, students examine primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9549 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Multinational Britain Prof. Woods (NYU London) The idea of British national identity has been built around a sense of united statehood within the confines of the four nations comprising the United Kingdom, ruling overseas territories. As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Edelstein (NYU Florence) In Italy, regional identities have always been strong, while national identity has always been complex, a situation that characterizes even current political debates. Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts. FALL 2013 MAP-UA 9750 Expressive Culture: Film Prof. Carrigy (NYU Sydney)  syllabus How   has Australian cinema engaged with significant and often contested   historical, political and cultural events in the nation\u2019s past? We take a   critical perspective on the history of colonisation in Australia, the   legacies of the Stolen Generations, the controversies surrounding   Australia\u2019s role in World War One and the Vietnam War, as well as   Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbors, through   films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about   the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo   (2009). We also consider films that have employed innovative narrative   and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past   and the present such as Two Laws (1982) and The Tracker (2002).   Students develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts   of cinema studies and a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers   have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched   detail, allegory, and archives across a diverse range of examples,   including restorations, revivals, and re-imaginings of Australian cinema   history such as the controversial restoration of Wake in Fright (1971)   as an Australian classic; the reconstruction of Australia\u2019s first   feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906); and the revived   interest in Ozploitation after the release of Not Quite Hollywood   (2008).

SPRING 2014  CORE -UA 9554 Cultures &amp; Contexts: Italy Prof. Palmer (NYU Florence)   syllabus  Through the study of primary texts, we examine how Italians registered their own similarities and differences within a national context, and how they regarded the tourists, students, soldiers, and immigrants who have come in increasing numbers to Italy. We also consider the accounts of foreign visitors to Italy from the eighteenth-century until today, both from the perspective of western tourists seeking \u201cculture\u201d and through the eyes of immigrants from Eastern Europe, North Africa, and beyond. The Italian city, and in particular Florence, will serve as our primary unit of measurement for investigating Italy. To this end, we visit a number of sites in Florence and in Tuscany in order to conduct fieldwork to structure and inform our scholarly conversations and written work. SPRING 2014 CORE-UA 9554, Cultures and Contexts: Italy Prof. Cao (NYU Florence)  syllabus Examines how Italian identity has been transformed through encounters with foreigners. These were not only invading armies and colonizing powers but also artists and scholars, travelers, and tourists. We explore how the Greek, Arab, Byzantine, and Jewish presences reshaped Italian civilization up to the Renaissance, focusing on their cultural consequences from a number of perspectives, from science to language, to political thought, to art and architecture. A field trip to Ravenna (capital of the Western Roman Empire, then of the Ostrogothic Kingdom, and later of the Byzantine Exarchate) offers a vantage point to appreciate the many layers of Italian cultural history. Florence is used as a primary source for the history of Grand Tour as well as the recent development of mass tourism in Italy, and is the setting for a fieldwork project to chart the cultural impact and memory of foreigners in the city.

C. From the populism of the Depression era films of Frank Capra to post-WWII paranoia, the cynical films of the post-Watergate era and more recent depictions of media-constructed realities, we explore the ways film reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. At the same time, students learn how filmmakers create meaning through the building blocks of editing and cinematography and the manipulation of audience expectations of genres, stars, and \u201cHollywood endings.\u201d           Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}, {"content": "History of England               The History of England            History    Politics    Geography       Prehistoric England      Bones and flint tools found in Norfolk and Suffolk show that Homo erectus lived in what is now England around 700,000 years ago. At this time, England was linked to mainland Europe by a large land bridge. The current position of the English Channel was a large river flowing westwards and fed by tributaries that would later become the Thames and the Seine. This area was greatly depopulated during the period of the last major ice age, as were other regions of the British Isles. In the subsequent recolonisation, after the thawing of the ice, genetic research shows that present-day England was the last area of the British Isles to be repopulated[14], circa 13,000 years ago. The migrants arriving during this period contrast with the other of the inhabitants of the British Isles, coming across land from the south east of Europe, whereas earlier arriving inhabitants came north along a coastal route from Iberia. These migrants would later adopt the Celtic culture that came to dominate much of western Europe.      Roman conquest of Britain      By AD 43, the time of the main Roman invasion of Britain, Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. Like other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had long enjoyed trading links with the Romans, and their economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. With the fall of the Roman empire 400 years later, the Romans left England.           Anglo-Saxon England       The History of Anglo-Saxon England covers the history of early mediaeval England from the end of Roman Britain and the establishment of Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the fifth century until the Conquest by the Normans in 1066.Fragmentary knowledge of Anglo-Saxon England in the 5th and 6th centuries comes from the British writer Gildas (6th century) the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (a history of the English people begun in the 9th century), saints\u2019 lives, poetry, archaeological findings, and place-name studies.       The dominant themes of the seventh to tenth centuries were the spread of Christianity and the political unification of England. Christianity is thought to have come from three directions \u2014 from Rome to the south, and Scotland and Ireland to the north and west.Heptarchy is a term used to refer to the existence (as believed) of the seven petty kingdoms which eventually merged to become the Kingdom of England during the early 10th century: Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Wessex.       The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms tended to coalesce by means of warfare. As early as the time of Ethelbert of Kent, one king could be recognised as Bretwalda (\u201cLord of Britain\u201d). Generally speaking, the title fell in the 7th century to the kings of Northumbria, in the eighth to those of Mercia, and finally, in the ninth, to Egbert of Wessex, who in 825 defeated the Mercians at the Battle of Ellendun. In the next century his family came to rule all England.       Kingdom of England       Originally, England (or Englaland) was a geographical term to describe the territory of Britain which was occupied by the Anglo-Saxons, rather than a name of an individual nation-state. It became politically united through the expansion of the kingdom of Wessex, whose king Athelstan brought the whole of England under one ruler for the first time in 927, although unification did not become permanent until 954. In 1016 England was conquered by the Danish king Canute the Great, and became the centre of government for his short-lived empire which also included Denmark and Norway. In 1042 England became a separate kingdom again with the accession of Edward the Confessor, heir of the native English dynasty.       The Kingdom of England (including Wales) continued to exist as an independent nation-state right through to the Acts of Union and the Union of Crowns. However the political ties and direction of England were changed forever by the Norman Conquest in 1066.       Norman Conquest       Kingdom of England by William the Conqueror (Duke of Normandy), in 1066 at the Battle of Hastings and the subsequent Norman control of England. It is an important watershed in English history for a number of reasons. The conquest linked England more closely with Continental Europe, and lessened Scandinavian influence. The success of the conquest established one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe, created the most sophisticated governmental system in Europe, changed the English language and culture, and set the stage for English-French conflict that would last into the nineteenth century.The events of the conquest also paved the way for a pivotal historical document to be produced - the Domesday Book. The Domesday Book was the record of the great survey of England completed in 1086, executed for William the Conqueror. The survey was similar to a census by a government of today and is England\u2019s earliest surviving public records document.

The Black Death is estimated to have killed between a third and two-thirds of Europe\u2019s population.

The plague repeatedly returned to haunt England throughout the fourteenth to seventeenth centuries. The Great Plague of London in 1665\u20131666 was the last plague outbreak.

NYU Institute for the Study of the Ancient World 15 East 84th Street, between 5th and Madison Aves. This  slide-illustrated talk recreates a \"grand tour\" to Egypt by L. Frank  Baum, well-known author of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and his wife  Maud in 1906. They embarked from Hoboken, New Jersey on January 27  bound for Naples where they were transferred to another ship which took  them to Alexandria and then by train to Cairo. After a few days in  Cairo with visits to the Egyptian Museum and the Giza Pyramids, they  boarded a Thomas Cook steamer bound for Luxor and Aswan with other  stops along the way, an itinerary nearly identical to many Egypt tours  today. One of Baum\u2019s many hobbies was photography and he recorded  their trip in numerous photos, now in the possession of his  great-grandson. Moyer contacted him and arranged to have them converted  to slides. The majority of these now 104 year-old sepia-tone images  have held up well and in this lecture, they are juxtaposed with Moyer\u2019s  own photos of the same sites taken decades later, most from the same  perspective. The contrast between how the ancient monuments looked in  1906 and how they appear today (some badly deteriorated and others that  have had some restoration) makes for a striking visual presentation.  During the lecture, Moyer quotes many of Maud Baum\u2019s humorous and  sometimes poetic remarks drawn from her letters written to family  members during the trip describing their experiences and her impression  of the monuments they visited.

Rostovtzeff Lectures    Authorship, Tradition, and Performance in Early China: The Staged Author and the Rise of Literature Martin Kern, Princeton University Monday May 24, 2010 6:00PM     ISAW Lecture Hall     15 East 84th Street     New York, NY 10028      The figure of the author\u2014with the text read as personal expression and  the author understood or imagined through his text\u2014appeared with the  empire. Just when the totalizing imagination of political unity had  turned into reality, the author entered the scene as a figure of  individuality and rupture: a tragic hero standing defiantly against his  time who found himself exiled, punished, and driven into a suicide all  the while lamenting his fate in elaborate literary composition. This  figure\u2014with Qu Yuan as archetype\u2014became created, staged, and performed  in his text, fusing biography (in Sima Qian\u2019s case even autobiography)  with his own authorial voice. The result was an author-hero consumed by  fate and emotion that were both the cause and the consequence of his  textual creation.       Reception to follow.

NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The status of Late Bronze Age ships within eastern Mediterranean societies Caroline Sauvage, ISAW Visiting Research Scholar Tuesday, May 18, 2010, 6:00PM Lecture Hall ISAW Building 15 East 84th Street New York, NY 10028 The  Late Bronze Age is known for its vast maritime exchange system and is  generally described as a period in which the major powers of the time  (Egypt, Hatti, Mitanni and Babylon) maintained intense relationships  marked by frequent exchanges of official and diplomatic correspondence.  These letters, preserved in royal or official archives, include  descriptions of gift exchanges, diplomatic marriages, and state  concerns. Among the various goods traded, prestige items (copper,  ivories, glass, incense, wood) are dominant in our sources as  exemplified by the Uluburun shipwreck. Prestige goods were shipped  alongside open shape ceramics and perishables such as grains or dried  fish. Besides these products, texts also indicate that ships, or parts  of ships, were traded between kingdoms such as Egypt, Cyprus, and the  Levant. Late Bronze Age ships are known from textual as well as  iconographical sources, and have been previously well studied from a  structural or technical point of view, either as documentary evidence  for naval construction, or as a general indication of well-developed  international maritime commerce. Ships were essential for  maintaining long distance trade, which allowed participating states to  keep their status while acquiring prestige goods. Furthermore, their  exchange among the club of big powers confirms their special status.  However, their vital importance for coastal regions is apparently  contradicted by the surprising paucity of pictorial representations in  the eastern Mediterranean. This talk will explore another aspect  of ships\u2019 representations and textual attestations. If we consider  material culture to be part of a people\u2019s identity, then a pictorial  representation echoes a careful selection process reflecting the  owners\u2019 world-view and their place within society. Thus objects and  their decoration allowed categories of people to define their relations  with others, institutions, and the spiritual world. It also enabled  them to place themselves within or outside of traditions. Our aim is to  investigate the impact of these objects on society and the \u201cvalue\u201d that  could have been associated with ships, through the diffusion, context  and frequency of ships\u2019 representations.

Rostovtzeff Lectures    Authorship, Tradition, and Performance in Early China: Writing and Peformance Martin Kern, Princeton University Monday May 17, 2010 6:00PM     ISAW Lecture Hall     15 East 84th Street     New York, NY 10028      Texts in early China were not disembodied ideas. As material artifacts  of bronze, bamboo, stone, silk, and wood, they served in a wide range  of contexts that all, in different ways, were fundamentally  performative\u2014from the early bronze inscriptions used in the ancestral  sacrifices to the presentation and recitation of bamboo writings at the  early imperial court, from royal proclamations and ancestral hymns to  exercises of political persuasion and self-cultivation, from  manuscripts buried in tombs to stele inscriptions erected on mountains.  More often than not, the rhetoric of performance was one of explicit  and highly codified remembrance: remembering and reconstituting not  just the past but the memory of the past.

NYU'S Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The First Annual M. I. Rostovtzeff Lectures Authorship, Tradition, and Performance in Early China: Texts as Rewritten Traditions Martin Kern, Princeton University Monday May 10, 2010 6:00PM   ISAW Lecture Hall   15 East 84th Street   New York, NY 10028      In the emerging early Chinese written tradition, texts, or parts of  texts, were constantly quoted and transformed. Uninhibited by notions  of authorship or original composition, existing texts reappeared in  ever-changing contexts and formations. Textual chains of  re-compositions and continuations only gradually settled into  intellectual traditions while still being punctuated by explicit  quotations and references to anonymous earlier texts. This culture of a  borrowed past produced as its principal icon the figure of Confucius.  Credited with the dictum \u201cI transmit but do not create,\u201d Confucius was  nevertheless cherished as a new source of traditional authority\u2014ready  to be invoked as he had invoked the kings of old.

Rostovtzeff Lectures Authorship, Tradition, and Performance in Early China: Texts Without Authors Martin Kern, Princeton University Monday May 3, 2010 6:00PM ISAW Lecture Hall 15 East 84th Street New York, NY 10028 For  the first eight hundred years of the early Chinese textual tradition,  the notion of the author is nearly completely absent. Instead, texts  are presented in a totalizing vision: poetry representing the different  states within the early Chinese realm, royal speeches from different  periods, sweeping divinatory, cosmological, and historical accounts,  and a wide range of philosophical and technical writings encompassing  the entire social order. In all these, the notion of the author was not  merely absent; instead, texts were composed in a way that rendered any  authorial presence entirely invisible. No author could be held  responsible for them, nor could a text be defined through its  connection to an actual persona.  Reception will follow.

It was the first state in that region to send an  embassy to Han China (206 BCE-220 CE), and maintained contact with  China for about five hundred years. For this reason, the most important  sources of information about Kangju are the Chinese historical texts.  Unfortunately, their accounts tend to be short and lack details, so our  understanding of Kangju and its relations with ancient China has been  rather limited. This lecture will focus on some important new  inscriptions recently discovered. They will not only help us check how  reliable the Chinese historical sources are, but also tell us much more  about the Kangju and their contacts with China. The first group  consists of a dozen wooden slips with Chinese writing found at the  Xuanquan site in Dunhuang, China and dated to the late Western Han  Dynasty (206 BCE-24 CE). The second group is a set of Sogdian  inscriptions from Kultobe in Kazakhstan, deciphered by Prof. N.  Sims-Williams. Combining the Chinese historical records with the newly  discovered inscriptions, we can contextualize the Kultobe inscriptions,  assign a likely date to them, and elucidate the history of Kangju from  the first to the fourth century CE (i.e., from the Chinese Han to the  Jin Dynasty). This event is free and open to the public. For more information please contact isaw@nyu.edu .  NYU'S Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The Earliest Semitic Literature: The Road to Ebla Gonzalo Rubio, Pennsylvania State University Monday, April 26, 2010, 6:00PM ISAW Lecture Hall 15 East 84th Street New York, NY 10028 The  discovery of thousands of well-preserved cuneiform tablets dating to  the mid-third millennium B.C.E. at Ebla (Tell Mardikh) in northwestern  Syria, has revolutionized our knowledge of the history of the Semitic  languages and the ancient Near East. The Ebla corpus includes  administrative and chancellery documents, as well as lexical lists,  incantations, a royal ritual, and a number of literary compositions.  Most of these compositions are written in the local Semitic language,  Eblaite. Both the language of Ebla and its early Semitic literature  belong to a cultural continuum that stretched from southern Mesopotamia  all the way to northern Syria. Across this extended scribal landscape,  early Semitic and Sumerian traditions underwent various processes of  textualization and cross-pollination. Such interactions materialized in  a literature whose archaic nature makes it as captivating as it is  intellectually challenging. This event is free and open to the public.

The priestess who  pronounced the oracles sat on a tall tripod above the fissure where she  could inhale the vapor, thus triggering a trance in which she could  serve as a medium for the prophetic oracles. Most scholars have been  skeptical of these reports, denying that there had ever been a fissure  or a gaseous emission in the crypt of the temple. However, in 1995 an  interdisciplinary team studied the evidence from geology, chemistry,  and toxicology that related to the oracle. The results vindicated the  ancient sources. Dr. Hale and his colleagues have gone on to study  Greek oracle sites elsewhere in the Aegean and Asia Minor, where they  have found similar geological features.

We will take as example the  epigraphic corpus of the ancient Campa kingdom(s), which lay in what is  now central and southern Vietnam. The study of Campa epigraphy involves  texts in Sanskrit and in the poorly known vernacular Old Cam language,  which belongs to the Austronesian language family. This field of  research once flourished in French colonial times, then all but died  out after WW II, and has only recently been resuscitated from a coma  that lasted for decades. Newly discovered inscriptions have started to  be published again, and a census of Campa inscriptions was undertaken  last September-October in museums and archaeological sites of Vietnam.  The aim of the census was to up-date the general inventory of Campa  inscriptions, whose last published installment dates to 1942, and to  record essential data of previously known and newly discovered  epigraphical documents. The presentation will discuss general aspects  of Southeast Asian epigraphy, as well as specific aspects of the Campa  corpus and the history of its study. Some new inscriptions, which throw  interesting new light on the history of Campa and its place within the  larger scale development of Southeast Asian history, will be selected  for close inspection.

Fulfilling these spiritual and material requirements  would allow them to live forever in the afterlife. To lead a life of  justice, the god Osiris had established clear rules which every  educated Egyptian tried to learn. But the materials needed to furnish a  tomb could be an impediment for people who were neither royal nor  noble. Egyptians used a variety of methods to economize on these  necessities. This talk examines both the spiritual and material  struggles Egyptians underwent in order to live forever. The lecture is free and open to the public. Reception to follow. For more information please contact isaw@nyu.edu NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents Temple Treasury Records and Local Politics in Ur III Mesopotamia Xiaoli Ouyang, Visiting Research Scholar Tuesday, February 16, 2010, 6:00 PM Institute for the Study of the Ancient World 15 East 84th Street This  lecture targets a group of Umma texts dated to the Ur III dynasty (c.  2112-2004 BCE), probably the best documented period in Mesopotamian  history. Umma is the province with the largest number of texts,  accounting for almost one third of the 90,000 or so records from this  period. This group of texts documents the delivery of treasures, mostly  objects made of precious metals and stones, to temple households as  ex-voto gifts, and the subsequent registration and disbursement of  these objects. A prosopographical study identifies among the  donors governors, mayors, agricultural administrators, doctors,  merchants, and scribes. The recipients of the gifts include priests,  top officials in Umma\u2019s four districts, and shepherds. Evidence  demonstrates that the precious items were separated from the general  votive offerings and kept in a treasury called \u201chouse of the god,\u201d  under the custody of a special guardian. Not only did he disburse the  treasures for their sanctioned use, he also funneled a great number of  valuables from the temple treasury to Umma governors for undisclosed  purposes. This indicates that the governor may well have maintained a  strong control over the temple households in Umma, a scenario that  hearkens back to a much earlier historical period despite the  unprecedented degree of centralization going on in the Ur III kingdom.

Anthony, Hartwick College 'Old  Europe' refers to a cycle of Copper Age cultures in southeastern Europe  that rose to a surprising level of complexity between about 5000-3500  BC and then collapsed. The astonishing art, solidly built towns and  villages, and female-centered domestic cults that defined Old Europe  disappeared. The decline of Old Europe is poorly understood and hotly  debated. This lecture reviews competing theories of the collapse  and suggests that pastoral herding societies from the arid steppes of  Ukraine might have played a significant role by destabilizing the  agricultural economies of Old European towns. Thursday, December 3, 2009, 6:00PM Institute for the Study of the Ancient World Lecture Hall 15 East 84th Street New York, NY 10028 This event is free and open to the public. A reception will follow.

NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents Bringing the Frontier to the Center: Empires and Nomads from Achaemenid Persia to Tang China Wu Xin, Visiting Research Scholar Monday, November 30, 2009, 6:00PM Lecture Hall ISAW Building 15 East 84th Street New York, NY 10028  This  paper presents a comparative consideration of the ideological  strategies used by Achaemenid and the Tang empires to manage relations  with their subjects living in Central Asia and on the Central to  Eastern Eurasian steppe. For both empires, the nomadic communities to  the north were an especially important constituency that was  complicated by strong dynastic hereditary ties. In each case, a  conscious program specifically addressing this complex and mobile  community was developed and was expressed through the official language  (text and images) of the imperial court. An exploration of those  programs reveals striking parallels in their approach to maintaining  imperial control and cooperation. This event is free and open to the public.

NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The Birth of European Painting in the Sands of Egypt Thomas Mathews, John Langeloth Loeb Professor Emeritus in the History of Art, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University This  lecture is a preliminary report on a project studying some 62 painted  panels from Roman Egypt, which are practically the only surviving  examples of this important artistic genre from the ancient world.  Representing the Egyptian pantheon in its final manifestation, they are  an important document of the history of religion. But the evidence also  looks forward to the continuance of panel painting in the medieval  world, introducing many of the formulae and compositions of Byzantine  icon painting, formulae which endured even to the Renaissance.

New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The Lost World of Old Europe: The Danube Valley, 5000 \u2013 3500 BC Wednesday, November 11, 2009 Institute for the Study of the Ancient World 15 E. 84th Street New York, NY 10028 The  Lost World of Old Europe brings to the United States for the first time  more than 250 objects recovered by archaeologists from the graves,  towns, and villages of Old Europe, a cycle of related cultures that  achieved a precocious peak of sophistication and creativity in what is  now southeastern Europe between 5000 and 4000 BC, and then mysteriously  collapsed by 3500 BC. Long before Egypt or Mesopotamia rose to an  equivalent level of achievement, Old Europe was among the most  sophisticated places that humans inhabited. Some of its towns grew to  city-like sizes. Potters developed striking designs, and the ubiquitous  goddess figurines found in houses and shrines have triggered intense  debates about women\u2019s roles in Old European society. Old European  copper-smiths were, in their day, the most advanced metal artisans in  the world. Their intense interest in acquiring copper, gold, Aegean  shells, and other rare valuables created networks of negotiation that  reached surprisingly far, permitting some of their chiefs to be buried  with pounds of gold and copper in funerals without parallel in the Near  East or Egypt at the time. The exhibition, arranged through loan  agreements with 20 museums in three countries (Romania, Bulgaria and  the Republic of Moldova), brings the exuberant art, enigmatic \u2018goddess\u2019  cults, and precocious metal ornaments and weapons of Old Europe to  American audiences.

Central Eurasia from the Pontus to the  Baikal was a major theater of population movements from the dispersal  of the Indo-Europeans to the migratory waves of the early Middle Ages.  While often met with skepticism, the recent encounter between molecular  biology and genetic studies with linguistics, archaeology, and physical  anthropology has heralded radical changes in the study of the ancient  world, if nothing else because all these disciplines have consequently  been thrown into closer contact with each other. A dialogue has  developed among geneticists, linguists, archaeologists and  anthropologists over the past twenty-some years that, while sometimes  dissonant and acrimonious, has produced ideas and data that may prove  useful for historical research. How should the historian of the ancient  world view this development? Does the historian have a role to play?  This question will be discussed especially in relation to the study of  ancient Eurasian nomads. For more information please click here.  New York University's Department of Classics presents Conception and practice of Roman rule: the example of transport infrastructure Anne Kolb, University of Zurich Thursday, October 29, 2009, 6:00PM Classics Department Conference Room, 5th floor Silver Center for Arts and Science 32 Waverly Place or 31 Washington Place (wheelchair access)  New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The ISAW Visiting Research Scholar Lecture Series The  Horse is Man's Wings: Archaeological Science and the Changing Nature of  the Human-Horse Relationship in Central and East Asia in Prehistory  Mim Bower, Cambridge University Tuesday, October 27, 2009, 6:00PM  ISAW Lecture Hall, Second Floor 15 E. 84th Street New York, NY 10028  The  relationship between horses and humans reaches far back into  prehistory. At first, horses were a source of human food, but at some  time in the past, perhaps during the process of domestication, horses  took on a much greater role. Not only were they ridden, giving humans  the possibility of traveling with great speed over large distances, or  harnessed in chariots, which could be used to show status and power,  they became venerated in a way that no other domestic animals have  been. During the 2nd and 1st millennia BC, all across central and east  Asia, in harness or with chariots, in groups, or alone, horses were  buried along with their owners and carers, sometimes with the most  amazing grave goods. Ultimately, an entirely new way of life developed  from these practices: equestrian pastoral nomadism. But the importance  of the horse in central and east Asia does not end in prehistory. The  horse remains a powerful symbol in many cultures today and is  associated with ideas of identity and nationhood. In this  presentation, Dr. Bower will report on the results of a large  interdisciplinary archaeological science project which explores the  evolving relationship between horses and humans, from prehistory to the  present day using a wide range of cutting edge archaeological science  methods, including archaeogenetics (living population genetics and  ancient DNA), geometric morphometrics, paleopathology, zooarchaeology  and ethnography, while working towards an understanding of the changing  relationship between humans and horses across time.

New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The ISAW Visiting Research Scholar Lecture Series A Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire? The View from New York David Taylor, University of Oxford Tuesday, October 6, 2009, 6:00PM ISAW Lecture Hall, Second Floor 15 E. 84th Street New York, NY 10028 The  overwhelming majority of the surviving epigraphic texts of the Late  Antique Roman provinces of Syria and Mesopotamia are written in Greek,  and in a number of recent books and articles it has been argued that  Greek was in fact the ordinary daily language of the local populations.  By examining examples of the full available range of ancient linguistic  evidence, and drawing on sociolinguistic theory about multilingualism  and diglossia, this thesis will be challenged, and a more complex  pattern of language usage will be sketched out. The consequences of  this for issues of local identity and culture will then be explored.  For more information, please click here.  New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents The Sarcophagus East and West Wu Hung, University of Chicago Jas Elsner, Oxford University Friday, October 2- Saturday, October 3, 2009 Institute for the Study of the Ancient World 15 E. 84th Street New York, NY 10028 This  conference focuses mainly on decorated stone sarcophagi from around the  second century BCE to the third century CE, when this type of burial  equipment not only continued to develop in the parts of Europe  dominated by the Roman Empire, but also enjoyed considerable popularity  in East Asia. Whereas the chronological and formal developments of each  regional tradition remain an important research goal, this conference  encourages comparative observations and interpretations of ancient  sarcophagi in broader geo-cultural spheres and more specific  ritual/religious contexts. It is hoped that by addressing these two  research objectives simultaneously, this conference will help open new  ways to think about the development of art and visual culture in a  broadly defined ancient world, where the art historical materials  available are subject to comparable methodological constraints both  from archaeological excavation and from known literary and historical  contexts.

The NYU Humanities Initiative and the Department of Classics present Anti-democratic voices in ancient Greece and Rome (and their legacies) Janet Coleman, New York University and London School of Economics Thursday, September 17, 2009, 6:00 P.M. 20 Cooper Square (at East 5th Street), Room 503 Professor  Coleman will discuss anti-democratic arguments found in the literature  of ancient Greece and Rome, to illustrate the ever-present voices of  potentially or actually dispossessed elites and their attitudes to  'ordinary minds'. Beginning with what we today take equality and  democracy to mean, she seeks to demonstrate the uniqueness of what  Athens had as democratic with its rather startling view of the  political AS emotional. She will contrast this with Roman republican  and imperial attitudes to the emotions, especially as influenced by  Stoic philosophy, and with reference to their views of the emotionally  undisciplined mob. Developing an argument that distinguishes between  social free speech and political free speech, she wants to indicate  that we owe more to the Romans than to the Greeks in that we have kept  alive some of the most prominent anti-democratic voices of that ancient  past, in our own. Reception to follow.  Events of 2008-2009               New York University's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World presents Excavations At Amheida In Egypt Roger Bagnall, Director, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University Wednesday, June 17, 2009, 6:00PM Institute for the Study of the Ancient World 15 E. 84th Street New York, NY 10028 Amheida   is a vast archaeological site on the western edge of Dakhla Oasis in  Egypt. A team of researchers led by Dr. Roger Bagnall, Director of the  Institute for the Study of the Ancient World at NYU, began the Amheida  Project in 2001 with an intensive investigation and survey of the site. One  of the most spectacular discoveries, near the centre of the town in  Area 2, is the house of Serenus, who was part of the city council in  the middle of the 4th century. The structure contains fifteen rooms,  one of which was painted with classical wall scenes. On the northern  wall, to the left of the doorway, a mythological scene depicts the  legend of Perseus rescuing the beautiful Andromeda who is about to be  devoured by a sea-monster, while to the right of the door is the  Homeric scene of the Return of Odysseus to Ithaca, from his long voyage  which brought him to Egyptian shores. The site at Amheida will  be part of a long-term scheme for the Dakhla Oasis Project. Please join  us for a presentation and discussion on Amheida and its archaeological  significance.

These documents were pieces of a single, complex system, the  Persepolis Fortification Archive, that proved\u2014after decades of  painstaking work\u2014to be the largest and most important single source of  information from within the Persian Empire on Achaemenid Persian  languages, history, society, religion and art. Now, the Archive faces a  legal battle that could well lead to its dismemberment and loss if it  is seized and sold, and disappears into the holdings of private  collectors around the world. Fueled by this crisis the Persepolis  Fortification Archive Project is a new phase in recording and  distributing the results of the study of the archive, responding to  emergency conditions with electronic equipment and media alongside the  conventional tool-kits of philology and scholarship.

The Egyptological Seminar of New York presents Egyptian Landscape Painting: The Old Kingdom Mastaba Chapel as a Map of the World Ann  Macy Roth, Clinical Associate Professor of Egyptology; Clinical  Associate Professor of Hebrew and Judaic Studies, Art History, New York  University Friday, April 3, 2009, 6:30PM The Art Study Room, Uris Center Metropolitan Museum of Art Just  as New Kingdom temple decoration represents an attempt to model the  world schematically in a building, the decoration in some Old Kingdom  mastaba chapels suggests a kind of modeling more literally tied to the  surrounding landscape. Some scenes were apparently placed on the walls  to make complex allusions to space and time, creating an internal world  that has some startling correlations with the external one. This kind  of mapping of the landscape alternated and combined with more  independent cosmological models, and can sometimes also be seen in the  decorative programs of later periods.

Corey Brennan, Associate Professor of Classics, Rutgers University Monday, November 3, 2008, 6:00pm Classics Seminar Room, Room 503 Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East The  aim of this talk is to examine some popular conceptions of sexuality  that emerged in the Greek and Roman world, and to see which dead-ended,  and which ones are still with us in one form or other today. Particular  attention will be paid to how the ancient Greeks and Romans mapped  quite specific sexual stereotypes onto various geographic areas, and  offer some explanations why they did so. New York University's Gallatin School of Individualized Study presents Penelope! Featuring Ellen McLaughlin Oct. 29-31 at 7 p.m.; Nov. 1 at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Jerry H. Labowitz Theatre for the Performing Arts 1 Washington Place \u201cPenelope\u201d  is a music-theater piece featuring Ellen McLaughlin and a string  quartet with original music by Sarah Kirkland Snider. In the play, a  woman\u2019s ex-husband appears at her door after an absence of 20 years,  suffering from brain damage. A veteran of a modern war, he doesn\u2019t know  who he is and she doesn\u2019t know who he\u2019s become. While they wait  together for his return to himself, she reads him The Odyssey, and in  the journey of that book, she finds a way into her former husband\u2019s  memory and the terror and trauma of war. The event is free and  open to the NYU community ($10 for the general public), but tickets are  required for entry. For more information, call 212.998.4941. New York University's Department of Classics and Department of Hellenic Studies present Classicism, Primitivism, and Modernist Performance Professor Olga Taxidou , Senior Lecturer in Drama, University of Edinburgh Wednesday, October 22, 2008, 7:00pm 5 Washington Place, Room 101   New York University's Department of Classics presents Ancient Education: the Papyri versus the Literary Sources  Raffaella Cribiore, Professor of Philosophy, New York University Tuesday, October 21, 2008, 12:15pm Classics Seminar Room, Room 503 Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East This  talk covers the various levels of Greek education (from primary to  rhetorical) in a very long period, about 10 centuries between the  Hellenistic period and the Arab conquest of Egypt in the seventh  century AD. I intend to show how the papyri from Greco-Roman Egypt  illuminate and clarify what the literary sources have handed down to  us. I will mostly treat this long period as a continuum, in which the  basic lines of education remained unchanged, but I will point to some  subtle changes that sometimes took place. In this presentation there  will be plenty of images from papyri, sherds, tablets and mummy  portraits. At the end I will go over the texts recently discovered in  the excavation of Amheida that is now sponsored by NYU.  The NYU Center for Ancient Studies and the Archaeological Institute of America present Christian Destruction and Desecration of Images of Classical Antiquity Dr. John Pollini, Professor of Art History and History, University of Southern California Thursday, October 16, 2008, 6:30pm Jurow Lecture Hall Silver Center, Room 101A 100 Washington Square East In  popular culture Christianity is remembered for the art, architecture,  customs, rituals, and myths that it preserved from the classical past.   It is rarely acknowledged, however, that Christianity also destroyed a  great deal in its conversion of the Roman Empire. The material  evidence for Christian destruction has often been overlooked or gone  unrecognized even by archaeologists. Professor Pollini\u2019s talk examines  various forms of Christian destruction and desecration of images of  classical antiquity during the fourth to seventh centuries, as well as  some of the attendant problems in detecting and making sense of this  phenomenon. This talk is based on Professor Pollini\u2019s present book  project, \"Christian Destruction and Desecration of Images of Classical  Antiquity: A Study in Religious Intolerance and Violence in the Ancient  World,\" for which he received fellowships from the Guggenheim  Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies. New York University's Department of Classics presents \u201cBoubr\u00f4stis, Meat Eating and Comedy: Erysichthon as Famine Demon in Callimachus' Hymn to Demeter\" Chris  Faraone, Frank Curtis Springer and Gertrude Melcher Springer Professor  in the Humanities and the College, University of Chicago  Thursday, October 16, 2008, 12:30pm Classics Seminar Room, Room 503A Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East The NYU Center for Ancient Studies and the NYU Classics Department present Serena Connolly Assistant Professor of Classics, Rutgers University Forming Roman Minds: Roman Society in the Distichs of Cato Monday, September 29, 2008, 6:30 pm Classics Seminar Room, Room 503A Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East The  Distichs of Cato are among the most widely translated (and thus  disseminated) of all Latin texts, yet few Classicists know this  collection well or indeed know of it at all. Comprising about 150  motalizing sayings, the Distichs offered easily digestible instructions  for life served in simple language. The collection offers guidance on  every aspect of life: family matters, professional and private conduct,  duties to others and relationships with those in power. Given  the popularity of the collection and its likely audience, the Distichs  are a valuable source of insights into how a large section on Romans  viewed their society. A brief survey of entires that concern Romans'  relationships with each other and their attitudes towards law reveals  an emphasis on self-preservation and pragmatism. This collection  teaches community-minded behavior, but also gives lessons in survival.

Whenever they negotiated political alliances with the Eastern Empire, to be sealed by a marriage, they specified that they wanted such a princess. The epithet \u2018porphyrogennitos\u2019, purple-born, derives from the Porphyra, a purple chamber in the Great Palace of the emperors in Constantinople, where empresses gave birth to their children. In the mid-eighth century Emperor Constantine V built it as a device to perpetuate his ruling dynasty in Byzantium. It reflected his determination, as the son of a usurper, to bestow legitimacy on his eldest son and heir. Children of both sexes carried the title and princesses were regularly sought as \u2018purple-born\u2019 brides for western, Slavic and Russian rulers. Part of the enduring attraction of such alliances was due to the spectacular Byzantine gifts that accompanied diplomatic embassies to all parts of the known world. Although neither Theophano nor Maria Agyropoulaina were in fact \u2018born in the purple\u2019, their lavish dowries confirmed western appreciation of Byzantine luxury objects: silks, enamels, ivories and jewelry. By the mid-eleventh century, however, Byzantine brides began to provoke anxiety, even condemnation, in the West. In this illustrated talk I will examine the reasons for this shift and set the purple-born princesses in the context of medieval international diplomacy.

She has written papers on Dionysius of Halicarnassus, sections of whose work she is currently engaged in translating and annotating, on the elder Pliny, and on the influence of Greek myth on the Victorian novelist Charlotte M. Yonge.                  The NYU Institute of Fine Arts presents Olga Palagia Professor of Classical Archaeology, University of Athens Monumental Sculpture from Samothrace    Tuesday, April 8, 2008 1:00p.m. Institute of Fine Arts 1 East 78th Street                  The IHARE Presents Guenter Kopcke Institute of Fine Arts, New York University 9th Century B.C.E. Finds from Biblical Yavneh (Israel): The First Foothold of Greeks in the Near East    April 7, 2008 7:00p.m. The JCC in Manhattan 334 Amsterdam Avenue at 76th Street Cost: $15 Public; $5 students and professional colleagues The lecturer discusses a selection of replicas of elaborate cult equipment ritually dumped and deposited, subject of a recent exhibition in the Eretz Israel Museum, Tel Aviv. The find is astonishing in numbers, but even more in lively narrative quality or \"image friendliness\" reminiscent of works of Greek invaders elsewhere, and earlier, along the path of \"Philistines\". The later gradual Hellenization of the Near East may have seen anearly beginning more intense and persevering than hitherto asserted. An equation Philistines = Greeks is perhaps in good part justified.

Fishing for Fish Sacrifice redresses these ideas by placing sacrifice of \"seafood\" in the wider context of Mediterranean religion and economy, and by tying it to religious communities other than the landed Greek polis - the multi-cultural world of seaborne communications, of travel and trade: it is from this milieu that we can capture evidence for feeding fish to the gods.
