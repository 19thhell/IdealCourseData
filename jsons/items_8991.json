Thus my classes are designed to explore and reveal the many interlocking relationships between multiple regions in the world, especially in the modern period. Regardless of the content of any particular class, perhaps an even more important goal is for students to leave my classes with stronger analytical skills. In this regard I intend for students to critically assess a wide variety of thinkers, ideologies, literatures and historical processes. Doing so requires intense focus on texts and their historical contexts, how they were constructed, their intended audiences, as well as language and style choices. These types of analytical skills transcend any given topic and field and will prove useful well beyond my classes and college itself.
