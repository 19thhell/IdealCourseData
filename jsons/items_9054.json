These must include the  following:   One introductory course: either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind  (LING-UA 3, formerly 28)   Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)   Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13)   Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12)   Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4)   One of the following: Language and Society (LING-UA 15); African American  English I: Language and Culture (LING-UA 23); Language in Latin America  (LING-UA 30); or Pidgin and Creole Languages (LING-UA 38)   Three courses freely chosen from the offerings of the department It  is highly recommended that majors and joint majors begin with the first three  requirements above, since other courses have these as prerequisites or  generally presuppose their content. Note that Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)  is only taught in the fall; it is a prerequisite for Phonological Analysis (LING-UA  12), which is also required for the major.          No  grade lower than C (or course taken pass/fail) may be counted toward the major  or toward a joint major. If any course is used to fulfill the major or minor  requirements of any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used  simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for any of the linguistics majors.          All  linguistics majors, joint majors, and combined majors must select and register  for linguistics courses with the advice of the director of undergraduate  studies in the linguistics department.                Joint  Majors with a Foreign Language          The  Department of Linguistics offers joint majors with the Departments of French,  German, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese. The major with Spanish requires a  total of ten 4-point courses (40 points); the majors with the other languages  require a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points).          The  linguistics portion of the joint foreign language majors is satisfied by taking  the following five courses (20 points):   One introductory course: either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind  (LING-UA 3, formerly 28)   Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)   Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13)   A total of two additional courses from two different fields of linguistics,  chosen from the following:   Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14, LING-UA 17, LING-UA 76)   Sociolinguistics (LING-UA 15, LING-UA 18, LING-UA 30, LING-UA 38)   Phonology (LING-UA 12)   Semantics (LING-UA 4)   Computational linguistics (LING-UA 3, LING-UA 24)   Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5, LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54) The  foreign language portion of the joint major is satisfied as follows.          French requires four  4-point courses (16 points) beyond the intermediate level:   One advanced language course chosen from:   Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101)   Phonetics (FREN-UA 103)   Translation (FREN-UA 107)   Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108)   Acting French (FREN-UA 109)   Business French (FREN-UA 110)   One course in advanced written French (usually Written Contemporary French,  FREN-UA 105)   Two courses in French literature, in French, to be determined in consultation  with the director of undergraduate studies in the French department. German requires four  4-point courses (16 points) beyond the intermediate level:   An advanced conversation or composition course chosen from:   German Conversation and Composition (GERM-UA 111)   Advanced Composition and Grammar (GERM-UA 114)   One additional course at the 100 level in conversation, composition, or culture   Introduction to German Literature (GERM-UA 152)   An additional advanced literature course, in German, to be determined in  consultation with the director of undergraduate studies in the German  department. Italian requires four  4-point courses (16 points) as follows:   Advanced Review of Modern Italian (ITAL-UA 30)   One advanced language course chosen from:   Conversations in Italian (ITAL-UA 101)   Italian Through Cinema (ITAL-UA 103)   Advanced Composition (ITAL-UA 105)   Creative Writing in Italian (ITAL-UA 107)   Italian Through Opera (ITAL-UA 108)   Translation (ITAL-UA 110)   Two advanced courses in either Italian literature or culture and society, to be  determined in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies in the  Italian department. Spanish requires five  4-point courses (20 points), consisting of Critical Approaches to Textual and  Cultural Analysis (SPAN-UA 200) and four more advanced courses chosen with the  advice of that department's director of undergraduate studies. Students may  apply one advanced conversation course toward the major. Note that Advanced  Grammar and Composition (SPAN-UA 100) does not count toward the major; this  course (or equivalent, or placement) is a prerequisite for entering the major.                Joint  Major in Anthropology and Linguistics          The  joint major in anthropology and linguistics emphasizes the complementary nature  of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are  required to take 20 points (five 4-point courses) each from the Department of  Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics. A grade of at least C is  required in every course for it to be counted toward the joint major.          Required  courses in anthropology are:   Human Society and Culture (ANTH-UA 1)   Anthropology of Language (ANTH-UA 17)   Either Cultural Symbols (ANTH-UA 48) or Language, Power, and Identity (ANTH-UA  16)   Two other cultural or linguistic anthropology courses approved by the director  of undergraduate studies in the Department of Anthropology. Required  courses in linguistics are:   Language (LING-UA 1)   Language and Society (LING-UA 15)   Two courses chosen from among the following:   Bilingualism (LING-UA 18)   Language, Literacy, and Society (LING-UA 20)   Sex, Gender, and Language (LING-UA 21)   African American English I: Language and Culture (LING-UA 23)   Language and Liberation at Home in the Caribbean and Abroad (LING-UA 26)   Language in Latin America (LING-UA 30)   A fifth course in linguistics, which may be an additional course from the above  list or another course that the department offers, chosen in consultation with  the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Linguistics. Joint  anthropology-linguistics majors should also consult with Professor Bambi  Schieffelin in the Department of Anthropology and Professor John Singler in the  Department of Linguistics for aid in developing their program of study.                Joint  Major in Language and Mind          This  major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the  Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology. Ten courses (40 points)  are required (four in linguistics, one in philosophy, four in psychology, and  one additional course).          The  linguistics component consists of these four courses:   Language and Mind (LING-UA 3, formerly 28)   Two courses chosen from the following:   Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4)   Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) [Note that Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)  is a prerequisite for Phonological Analysis and is only offered in the Fall  Semester.]   Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13)   One course, chosen from the following:   Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4)   Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5)   Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)   Computational Principles of Sentence Construction (LING-UA 24)   Form, Meaning, and the Mind (LING-UA 31)   Propositional Attitudes (LING-UA 35)   Neural Bases of Language (LING-UA 43 or PSYCH-UA 300)   Linguistics as Cognitive Science (LING-UA 48)   Learning to Speak (LING-UA 54)   Introduction to Morphology at an Advanced Level (LING-UA 55) The  philosophy component is a choice of one of the following three courses:   Minds and Machines (PHIL-UA 5)   Logic (PHIL-UA 70)   Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85) The  psychology component consists of four courses:   Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10)   Cognition (PSYCH-UA 29)   One course chosen from among the following:   The Psychology of Language (PSYCH-UA 56)   Language Acquisition and Cognitive Development (PSYCH-UA 300)   Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300)   Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300)   One course chosen from among the following:   Perception (PSYCH-UA 22)   Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience (PSYCH-UA 25)   Laboratory in Perception (PSYCH-UA 44)   Laboratory in Human Cognition (PSYCH-UA 46)   The Psychology of Language (PSYCH-UA 56)   Language Acquisition and Cognitive Development (PSYCH-UA 300)   Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300)   Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300) The  tenth course will be an additional course from the lists above that has not  already been taken to satisfy the departmental components. Joint majors should  consult with the respective directors of undergraduate studies of the  participating departments.                Minor      Four  courses (16 points) in linguistics with a grade of C or better in each course.  Courses taken pass/fail do not count. If any course is used to fulfill the  major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may  not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for the linguistics  minor.              Recommended  Work outside the Department      To meet standards currently set in the linguistics  field, as well as graduate school admission requirements, students majoring in  linguistics are advised to gain competence in the following areas during their  undergraduate studies: (1) one or more foreign languages, (2) psychology, for  issues of language and the mind, and anthropology, for issues of language and  culture, (3) mathematics or logic, for an understanding of modern algebra and  mathematical logic, (4) philosophy of language, and (5) one or more computer  languages. Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study away  programs. Note that any course substitution or transfer credit toward a  required course for the major must be confirmed by a letter from the director  of undergraduate studies.                Honors  in Linguistics      The  Department of Linguistics offers an honors track. The requirement for  graduation with honors in linguistics is an honors thesis of 40 to 50 pages,  typically the culmination of a year's work, and two advanced courses chosen  with the honors thesis adviser.          Students  who are excelling in the linguistics major are highly encouraged to develop an  honors project as early as the second semester of their sophomore year. It is  expected that students who pursue honors work in the Department of Linguistics  have sufficient preparation and background (i.e., high-level coursework) in a  field of linguistics, which is not always the case for students in the joint  majors with French, German, Italian, and Spanish.          Admission  to the honors program is by application in the second semester of junior year.  To be eligible, a student must have a GPA of 3.65 overall as well as in  linguistics. Applications are due to the director of undergraduate studies by  April 15 and must include a one- to two-page description of the topic that the  student wishes to investigate in the senior thesis. The student must identify a  faculty member in the Department of Linguistics who has agreed to supervise the  project, and the description of the thesis is written in consultation with this  faculty adviser. The student will be notified by May 1 about acceptance into  the honors program.          If  the student is accepted, the faculty member who has agreed to supervise the  student's honors thesis will become the student's honors adviser, and the two  advanced courses for honors will be chosen jointly by the student and the  adviser.                Joint  Honors      The  Department of Linguistics offers joint honors in all programs for which it  offers joint majors: language and mind, anthropology and linguistics, French  and linguistics, German and linguistics, Italian and linguistics, and Spanish  and linguistics.          For  the requirements of joint honors in anthropology and linguistics, students  should see Professor John Singler.          For  the requirements of joint honors in language and mind, students should follow  the same procedure for honors in linguistics, except that their proposal should  identify faculty members from two departments in the language and mind major  (linguistics, philosophy, and psychology), and these two faculty members will  be co-advisers. The thesis topic must reflect contributions to both  disciplines.          Students  interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics and French, German, Italian,  or Spanish should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in  linguistics, as well as in the language department, in or before the second  semester of their junior year.

A fifth course in linguistics, which may be an additional course from the above list or another course that the department offers (other than the courses recommended for nonmajors), chosen in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Linguistics.       Joint anthropology-linguistics majors should also consult with Professor Bambi Schieffelin in the Department of Anthropology and Professor John Singler in the Department of Linguistics for aid in developing their program of study.     Joint Major in Language and Mind    This major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology. Ten courses (40 points) are required (four in linguistics, one in philosophy, four in psychology, and one additional course).    The linguistics component consists of these four courses:       Language and Mind (LING-UA 3)    Two courses chosen from the following:          Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4)    Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12)    Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13)          One course, chosen from the following:          Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4)    Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5)    Sound and Language (LING-UA 11)    Computational Principles of Sentence Construction (aka Patterns in Language, LING-UA 24)    Form, Meaning, and the Mind (LING-UA 31)    Propositional Attitudes (LING-UA 35)    Neural Bases of Language (LING-UA 43 or PSYCH-UA 300)    Linguistics as Cognitive Science (LING-UA 48)    Learning to Speak (LING-UA 54)    Introduction to Morphology at an Advanced Level (LING-UA 55)             The philosophy component is a choice of one of the following three courses:       Minds and Machines (PHIL-UA 15)    Logic (PHIL-UA 70)    Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85)       The required psychology component consists of four courses:       Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10)    Cognition (PSYCH-UA 29)    One course chosen from among the following:          The Psychology of Language (PSYCH-UA 56)    Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300)    Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300)          One course chosen from among the following:          Perception (PSYCH-UA 22)    Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience (PSYCH-UA 25)    Neural Bases of Language (LING-UA 43)    Laboratory in Perception (PSYCH-UA 44)    Laboratory in Human Cognition (PSYCH-UA 46)    The Psychology of Language (PSYCH-UA 56)             The tenth course will be an additional course from the lists above that has not already been taken to satisfy the departmental components. Joint majors should consult with the respective directors of undergraduate studies of the departments involved.     Minor    Four courses (16 points) in linguistics with a grade of C or better in each course. If any course fulfills the major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for the linguistics minor.      Recommended Work Outside the Department    To meet standards currently set in the linguistics field, as well as graduate school admission requirements, students majoring in linguistics are advised to gain competence in the following areas during their undergraduate studies: (1) one or more foreign languages, (2) psychology, for issues of language and the mind, and anthropology, for issues of language and culture, (3) mathematics or logic, for an understanding of modern algebra and mathematical logic, (4) philosophy of language, and (5) one or more computer languages. Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study away programs. Note that any course substitution or transfer credit toward a required course for the major must be confirmed by a letter from the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    Honors in Linguistics    The Department of Linguistics, in accordance with the requirements for departmental honors that was passed by the Faculty of Arts and Science in Spring 2005, offers an honors degree in linguistics. The requirement for graduation with honors in linguistics is an honors thesis of 40 to 50 pages, typically the culmination of a year's work, and two advanced courses chosen with the honors thesis adviser.    Students who are excelling in the linguistics major are highly encouraged to develop an Honors project as early as the second semester of their sophomore year, even though students do not officially apply to the Honors Program until the second semester of their junior year. It is expected that students who pursue Honors work in the Department of Linguistics have sufficient preparation and background (i.e., high-level coursework) in a field of linguistics, which is not always the case for joint majors in French/German/Italian/Spanish and Linguistics.    Admission to the honors program requires an application in the second semester of junior year. It normally requires a GPA of 3.65 overall, as well as in linguistics, but this requirement can be waived by the College of Arts and Science director of college honors in exceptional circumstances by petition from the Director of Undergraduate Studies.    The application must be made by April 15 to the Director of Undergraduate Studies The application consists of an application form and a one- to two-page description of the topic that the student wishes to investigate in the thesis. The student must identify a faculty member in Linguistics who has agreed to work with the student. The description of the thesis is written in consultation with the faculty adviser. The student will be notified by May 1 about acceptance into the Honors program.    If the student is accepted, the faculty member who has agreed to supervise the student's honors thesis will become the student's honors adviser, and the two courses for honors will be chosen jointly by the student and the adviser.    Joint Honors    The Department of Linguistics offers joint honors in all programs for which it offers joint majors: language and mind, anthropology and linguistics, French and linguistics, German and linguistics, Italian and linguistics, and Spanish and linguistics. For the requirements of joint honors in anthropology and linguistics, students should see Professor John Singler.    For the requirements of language and mind, students should follow the same procedure for honors in linguistics, except that their proposal should identify faculty members from two departments in the language and mind major (linguistics, philosophy, and psychology), and these two faculty members will be co-advisers. The thesis topic, needless to say, should reflect contributions to both disciplines.    Students interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics and French, German, Italian, or Spanish should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies for linguistics, as well as the other department, in the second semester of their junior year.
