Richard Olivier, 1989), presented by Brent Edwards (Columbia University)   Presented by the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture     \u201cI\u2019m sad because I\u2019m schizophrenic, torn between many passions, desires and lovers. I\u2019m sad because I know the bottom line. I know what is going to happen to this world.\u201d     \u201cI\u2019m an orphan. And Ostend? That\u2019s my orphanage.\u201d     By 1981 Marvin Gaye was pretty much washed up. Heavily in debt, on the run from the I.R.S., in the middle of protracted divorces from Motown and from his wife, overing up mini-mountains of cocaine each day, abusive to his many partners, and, prone to dropping references to Nostradamus and Revelations, increasingly convinced that Apocalypse was imminent. He ended up in Ostend, a Belgian seafront town where, largely ignored by locals (\u201cWhere are you from? Paraguay?\u201d), he gazed at the grey skies, ran across lonely beaches and played darts badly in family cafes. He called it \u201ca beat back in tempo\u201d. It was a time of drift, reflection, expansion. A time of taking stock and recharging. Some kind of analogue to David Bowie\u2019s stay in Berlin at the end of the 1970s. Some kind of interregnum before the international but short-lived success of Sexual Healing and his violent death at the hands of his preacher father in 1984.     TRANSIT OSTEND is a moody, sometimes funny and quietly unforgettable portrait of the troubled singer that has long enjoyed a word-of-mouth reputation among filmmakers (Paul Kelly cited it as an influence on Lawrence Of Belgravia, his documentary about Lawrence from Felt), has inspired a song by the Band of Holy Joy (as well as a long-running comic routine by Reeves and Mortimer), but has rarely been seen.     BRENT EDWARDS, who will present Transit Ostend, is a Professor in the Department of English and Comparative Literature and the Center for Jazz Studies at Columbia University. His books include The Practice of Diaspora (2003), Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies (2004), and the forthcoming Epistrophies: Jazz and the Literary Imagination. His current projects include the restoration of Sweet Willie Rollbar\u2019s Orientation (an experimental film made by Julius Hemphill and members of the Black Artists Group in 1972), and a translation of Michel Leiris\u2019s 1934 classic Phantom Africa.

Burnham (Middlebury College)   Presented by the Medieval Virtual Seminar, a collaboration of the University of Bristol, The University of Oslo, Middlebury College, and New York University. A series of lectures on topics in medieval studies, one hosted by each institution, to take place during the 2014-15 academic year.     In 1329, Limoux N\u00e8gre was burned at the stake as an unrepentant heretic who claimed mystical inspiration for what he called his \"subtlety\" and his \"philosophy.\" The beliefs he professed were unlike any the inquisitors of Carcassonne had ever heard: skeptical and materialist, but also blasphemous, fantastical, and difficult for inquisitors and scholars alike to untangle. In this paper, I will argue that his mystical revelations bloomed on an alchemical substrate and that his most outrageous assertions regarding Jesus's death and resurrection were based on the science of the Pseudo-Llullian Testamentum.   Location: 3 Washington Square Village, Suite 1M (Ground Floor), Conference Room 104            ,           Book Talk: In Conversation with Daniel Schulman   Presented by the Tamiment Library and the John Brademas Center     Please join us for an upcoming book talk, \"In Conversation with Daniel Schulman\" on February 18th (6:00 PM) at the Tamiment Library.

While the observation that this fiction is a project in writing the nation may have grown to be something of a commonplace, what is less generally recognized is its inflection by elite ideologies of rule. I am interested in tracking the anxiety, rivalry, and ambivalence that surround the precariousness of elite authority on the national scene. In successive chapters of the book I seek out the internal contradictions and external threats that destabilize the status and assumptions of this historical ruling class. This paper identifies the connections, affective and historical, that a post-Independence-born generation of authors and their protagonists variously develop with their nationalist fathers in the process of inheriting the nation.      Rajeswari Sunder Rajan is Global Distinguished Professor in the Department of English at New York University, and has taught earlier at the universities of Delhi and Oxford. She works in the areas of postcolonial studies, feminist theory, gender, law, and religion in South Asia, British Victorian literature and the Anglophone novel in India.

Reception to follow   RSVP by February 13, 2015.   Location: Hemmerdinger Hall, Silver Center of Arts and Science            ,               Legacy in the Dust: The Four Aces Story, presented by Vivien Goldman   Few clubs in Britain can claim to have a history as illustrious as The Four Aces in Dalston, north-east London. Set up by Jamaican-born Newton Dunbar in 1967 to play blue beat, rocksteady and ska, it soon became a mecca not just for the capital's growing Caribbean population but for all Londoners bored of the sifted, soulless sounds they were hearing on mainstream radio. The club was a place to dance, but also a community centre, a para-academic space, a retreat from the increasingly militarised, stop-and-frisk streetscapes outside. Musicians such as Bob Marley, Joe Strummer, Stevie Wonder and even Bob Dylan made a beeline there. It played a pivotal role in the development of lover's rock, acid house, jungle and happy hardcore. But it was hated by local politicians and property speculators who demonised it as a gangster hang-out and Yardie-run drug hole before colluding to money-maim it into a block of luxury apartments. LEGACY IN THE DUST unearths rare archival material, talks to pioneering musicians such as Bunny Lee and Dennis Bovell, and tells - with love and with sadness - the rich history of a remarkable club.     LEGACY IN THE DUST will be presented by writer, broadcaster and post-punk musician VIVIEN GOLDMAN who spent many halcyon nights at The Four Aces. As well as recording a number of classic records, both solo and in Chantage, she has written for the likes of The Flying Lizards, Massive Attack and Ryuichi Sakamoto. She is an Adjunct Professor at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, Tisch School of the Arts where she teaches punk, Fela Kuti and reggae. Her five books include two on Bob Marley, most recently The Book of Exodus: The Making & Meaning of Marley's Album of the Century (Three Rivers Press). A Londoner, she now resides in Jackson Heights, Queens.     LEGACY IN THE DUST is the first screening in History Is Made At Night , an occasional series that gets its name from Neil Gordon-Orr's blog devoted to the politics of dancing and musicking.

Henry V and the Use of Languages,\u201d Malcolm Vale (Emeritus Research Fellow of History, St. John\u2019s College)   The reign of Henry V (1413-1422) was not only concerned with military victories. It also witnessed the emergence of the English language as an idiom and medium of government, politics and administration. For the first time since the Anglo-Saxon era, English was formally accepted as a language in which the ruler addressed his correspondents, officers and subjects. His promotion of English was part of an increasing \u2018personalisation\u2019 of kingship, and, paradoxically, its furtherance owed something to the continental ambitions of the English crown. We hear much about the rise of an English literary vernacular; less about its everyday use as a language of government, administration and business. The lecture will try to redress the balance.

Location: Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Reading for Mood: A Lecture by Jonathan Flatley (Wayne State University, Visiting Professor NYU)   Presented by the Department of Performance Studies Lecture Series     This lecture examines the usefulness of mood as a critical term at the current moment. Beginning with a consideration of the distinct places of affect in aesthetic theory and in critical reading practices, it makes a case for Martin Heidegger\u2019s understanding of Stimmung (which could also be translated as attunement) as a critical concept that helps us to read for the historicity and potentially political effects of aesthetic practices. To give an example of \u201creading for mood,\u201d I turn to the film Finally Got the News (1970), which the League of Revolutionary Black Workers made in collaboration with the Newsreel collective. I read this film as an attempt by the League to engage in the project of sustaining the revolutionary mood that had been awakened by the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement in 1968: how can such a mood, once awakened, be maintained? How does a politically active collective sustain and refresh itself?     The Performance Studies Lecture Series is a series of evening events featuring preeminent scholars and practitioners in the fields of art and performance. The events are presented on weekday evenings in the department's studio space, and are designed to create an informal and intimate setting for intellectual exchange among artists, students and scholars. Events are FREE and OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. Please note that seating is limited.     Questions?

Location: 244 Greene St, Room 105.            ,           Poetics and Theory Reading Group: On the Reproduction of Capitalism   Presented by NYU's Poetics and Theory Reading Group     The next meeting of the Poetics & Theory Reading Group will take place on Friday, March 13, at 4:30PM, in rm. #222, 19 University Place. We'll resume our discussion of On the Reproduction of Capitalism , picking up with chapters 3 and 4 (included in the PDF made available for the previous session) and continuing through chapters 5 and 6, as well as Appendix I, of which a PDF is now also available at here .   Location: Room 222, 19 University Place            , -           \"Modernity, world literature, and early modernisms in India,\" Supriya Chaudhuri (Jadavpur University)   Professor Chaudhuri\u2019s paper will examine the contested notion of world literature in the context of Bengali and other Indian modernisms in early twentieth century India. It has been argued that the idea of a world literature is tied in with the global reach of capital and its production of what Fredric Jameson calls a \u2018singular modernity\u2019 as well as what Franco Moretti describes as \u2018the world literary system\u2019. On such a view modernist literary communities in Calcutta or Buenos Aires are peripheral to the core modernist projects developed in Europe and America. This paper will posit instead the existence of a set of distributed, often resistant centers, whose members experience, as immediately as their European counterparts, the trauma, violence, and \u2018loss of history\u2019 that the process of modernization involves, and who struggle for a form of aesthetic recourse. How do early Indian modernisms negotiate with the world and with a notion of world literature? To understand this, Professor Chaudhuri will examine Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s essays on \u2018World Literature\u2019 (1907) and \u2018Modern Poetry\u2019 (1931) and his differences with the modernists; at rifts within early modernist groups; and at political radicalism and cosmopolitan friendships in the 1930s.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            , -               MARC Distinguished Lecture Series: \u201cTelling Tales: Piero di Cosimo, Renaissance Painter of Faith and Fantasy,\u201d Dennis Geronimus (NYU Art History)   Occasioned by the first-ever museum exhibition of Piero di Cosimo (1462-1522) painting career, now on view at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, this talk will introduce us to the most spellbinding storyteller of Renaissance Florence. A contemporary of Botticelli and Leonardo, Piero was esteemed in his day as a creative spirit of rare imagination, his visual poems rivaling the verses of the ancient poets whose myths and allegories he set out to transform in a wonderfully strange language all his own.     As his impressive list of patrons attests, Piero used his creative license to great advantage, devising elaborate fables the meanings of which continue to beguile us. But fantasy was not Piero\u2019s only domain. Equally compelling was his versatility as a master of many different styles, moods and subjects, sacred and profane. The common thread throughout is Piero\u2019s appeal to magical thinking.   Location: Silver, Room 300            ,               Can\u00edcula: Snapshots of a Girlhood in La Frontera, a Reading by Norma Elia Cant\u00fa   Chicana writer, folklorist, professor, and activist Norma Cant\u00fa will be reading and discussing excerpts from her book Can\u00edcula , winner of the 1995 Premio Azl\u00e5an Literary Prize, as well as from her works of poetry and her newly edited book on Chilean artist Liliana Wilson entitled Ofrenda: Liliana Wilson\u2019s Art of Dissidence and Dreams (Texas A&M University Press, 2014).

Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,               Surrounding One\u2019s Self with the Beauty of Life: Historicizing Nineteenth-Century Latina/o Writing   What distinguishes literature from other forms of writing? For example, Latina/o literary historians have uncovered only a handful of novels written by U.S. Latinas/os in the nineteenth century. And yet, the nineteenth-century Latina/o archive is chock-full of writing, both in manuscript-form and printed documents. How can these other documents contribute to our understanding of Latina/o literary history, and how might they force us to get at the root of what literature is supposed to offer? In 1850s San Antonio, Texas, Florencia Leal, a teenager attending the first girls\u2019 school, kept a beautiful journal where she transcribed letters to friends, wrote poems, copied lessons from school, and included sketches. My talk will address these questions by paying close attention to her journal, the earliest document written by a Texas-Mexican woman that I have been able to find in the course of fifteen years of archival research.     Ra\u00fal Coronado is an Associate Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley. Prior to Berkeley, Coronado was an associate professor in the English Department at the University of Chicago. Coronado's research focuses on Latina/o literary and intellectual history, from the colonial period to the 1940s. His first book A World Not to Come: A History of Latino Writing and Print Culture (Harvard 2013) won numerous awards, including the Modern Language Association Prize for a First Book and the Sixteenth Annual Susanne M. Glasscock Humanities Book Prize for Interdisciplinary Scholarship. This event is free and open to the public.   Location: 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor            ,               Medieval Forum Two-Part Event: \"Containing Texts: Literature in One, Two, and Three Dimensions,\" Thomas A. Bredehoft   Tom Bredehoft's talk examines the literary implications of textual materiality, specifically the literary effects and uses of the three-dimensional objects we call books or codexes. In asking whether the shape of the physical container affects or constrains the shapes of the texts it contains, Bredehoft opens the door for a new understanding of textual dimensionality, including a clarification of whether verse is to be understood as one-dimensional or two. Consider examples ranging from Anglo-Saxon poems to the contemporary comics of Chris Ware, Bredehoft argues that two- and three-dimensional texts give us crucial insight into both the unconscious habits of typographic print textuality and the promises and challenges of digital text.   Location: The Event Space, 244 Greene St.            ,           Poetry Reading: Theo Dorgan reads from Nine Bright Shiners   Cork-born Theo Dorgan is a novelist, translator, editor, sailor and poet whose most recent collection of poems, Nine Bright Shiners (Dedalus Press, 2014) was an Irish Times notable book of the year. He has also won the O'Shaughnessy Award for Irish Poetry and Listowel Prize for Poetry.     Theo Dorgan will read from Nine Bright Shiners , a sequence of elegies that reflect on early and recent deaths, from the loss of his infant sister to that of a contemporary by suicide. The book is unflinching in facing up to death and the poet\u2019s own mortality, but these dark meditations are framed by, subsumed into, whole-hearted celebrations of love, life, art and voyaging.     A former Director of Poetry Ireland/\u00c9igse \u00c9ireann, Theo has worked extensively as a broadcaster of literary programs on both radio and television. His other poetry collections include The Ordinary House of Love and Rosa Mundi (reprinted together as What This Earth Cost Us ), as well as, in Italian, La Case ai Margini del Mundo . He has edited several volumes.     Introduction by Luke Gibbons of Maynooth University, Ireland, Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

Location: TBA            ,               The Presence of the Past: Histories of the 18th-Century Transatlantic Book Trade in the Digital Age (Molly Hardy)   The digitization of early modern texts offers an encounter with temporal dislocation as new and old media meet. The presence of the past in objects that have been retained and remediated is at once foregrounded and elided in the digital moment. With examples from the eighteenth-century transatlantic book trade as represented in library catalogs and content databases, Molly O'Hagan Hardy will examine time's traces in the archives and how such traces can be re-conceived or eclipsed in digital humanities projects, ultimately asking how dueling temporalities define scholarly practices of research on archival materials in the digital age.     Molly Hardy manages the Isaiah Thomas Broadside Ballads digital project, the Database of the Early American Book Trades, and the Digital Antiquarian initiative. She has recently completed a digital edition of A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People, During the Late Awful Calamity in Philadelphia (1794). She received her in PhD in English from the University of Texas Austin, and her scholarship on archival research has appeared in The New Centennial Review and Book History .   Location: Avery Room, Bobst Library, 2nd Floor            ,           \"Joyce's Ghosts,\" Professor Luke Gibbons (Maynooth University, Ireland and Visiting Professor at NYU)   In his lecture, \u201cJoyce\u2019s Ghosts,\u201d Luke Gibbons proposes that Joyce\u2019s Irishness is intrinsic to his modernism, and is not just a source of subject matter but of form itself. Joyce\u2019s stylistic innovations are haunted by memory that slips its moorings in inner life, and circulates through the silences and shadows of a colonial counter-public sphere.     Luke Gibbons is professor of Irish literary and cultural studies at Maynooth University, Ireland, and the author of several books. He is Visiting Professor at NYU for Spring 2015.

But this sort of re-thinking has rarely been retrospective. A \"pre-history\" of postcolonial ideas is evident in the great internationalist movement of Third-Worldism that took place in the wake of decolonization after WWII. In this paper, Professor Srivastava compares postcolonial receptions of Frantz Fanon with earlier, Third-Worldist and anti-colonial receptions in the Italian context, with discussions of his role in influencing Italian psychiatry and renovating European Marxism. By examining 1960s and 1970s Italian editions and translations of his texts, she argues that historicizing this major anti-colonial thinker can lead to a re-reading of Fanon's theoretical body of work and his significance to the field.

The struggle for a comprehensive \u201cpermission to perform,\u201d which serves as a reminder of the disparity in power between the occupier and the occupied, characterizes the relationship between the Palestinian theatre artists and the state of Israel. I define \u201cpermission to perform\u201d as the guaranteed ability to legally, physically, literally, and publicly perform the experience of the oppressed under a systematically oppressive structure. By presenting three stories from the 1960s, 1970s, and the 1980s, I show that the Israeli censors\u2019 performance permit did not necessarily offer Palestinians the ability to perform freely. But in the struggle for such permission, these artists and their supporters created an inspiring model for cultural resistance.     Dr. Al-Saber is a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Theatre at Davidson College. His teaching and scholarship focus on the intersections of cultural production and political conflict.

Continuing this semester's focus on Marxist urban theory, we'll be looking at two essays from Edward Soja's Postmodern Geographies (chapters 3 and 4, attached). The first contains core concepts in Soja's reading of Henri Lefebvre, and frames the subfield of Marxist geography as it emerged in the 1970s. The second comprises Soja's formulation of uneven geographical development via David Harvey and Ernest Mandel. This makes for a good transition from our last session on Harvey and should provide a useful point of entry into Soja's work. And yet it misses much, notably leaving out his clearest postmodern commitments and famous case studies of Los Angeles (chapters 7, 8 and 9), his foray into ontology and critique of Heidegger (chapter 5), as well as his useful tour of developments in the spatial imaginary of critical social theory (chapters 1 and 2). I hope we'll get to briefly discuss these other bits, and if you get the chance, take a look at the last two chapters in particular.

(Click here to learn more about Lynch's book.) Our group discussion will be based on a selection from the book (email jh2625@nyu.edu to request the excerpt).     As this will be our final gathering before we part ways for the summer, we'll devote a portion of our meeting to planning for the coming year. Join us so that we can get your input. Help us identify speakers you'd like us to invite to the Workshop, events you'd be interested to see us host, etc.     Finally, help continue to grow our group by forwarding this email to others who may be interested in joining us, and bring a friend May 4th! To RSVP, email Jordan Hall at jh2625@nyu.edu . (Please indicate if you plan to bring a guest.) We look forward to seeing you.   Location: 244 Greene St. Event Space            ,           Transported: Imagining colonies with Edward Gibbon Wakefield and the young Charlotte Bront\u00eb   In 1829 in the seclusion of the Parsonage at Howarth in Yorkshire, a twelve-year-old Charlotte Bront\u00eb and her three younger siblings imagined a colony in Africa, a place they called Glass Town. On tiny pieces of paper sewn together into books, they composed an intricate saga of conquest and colonisation by a group of European discoverers. In the same year, the philosophical radical and occasional rake, Edward Gibbon Wakefield imagined a colony in Australia in his newspaper serial, \u2018Letter From Sydney\u2019. Wakefield\u2019s theory of colonisation, \u2018systematic colonisation\u2019, influenced some of the most important thinkers of his day, and shaped British colonial policy throughout the middle decades of the century -- surprisingly, perhaps, given that he wrote the \u2018Letter\u2019 while in Newgate prison, serving a sentence for a sexual crime, and had never been to Australia. Bront\u00eb\u2019s juvenile stories and Wakefield\u2019s text are different in style, scale, and intent, yet they share some intriguing preoccupations and contexts. Taken together they provide some commentary on this important phase of transcontinental migrations of the nineteenth century. In this paper I consider their parallel disquisitions on mobility, transportation (in relation to migration, punishment, and the imagination), individual freedom, and the capture of property and persons.

We are known for our broad view of the discipline, and understand \"literature\" to mean writing in all media, and its study to include all the ways in which texts have been produced, re-produced, circulated, and read, along with the modes of classification and the definitions of enjoyment used to understand them. The scholarly methods we employ, and in which we train our students, include close reading, historical and archival research, literary theory, the history of the book, media theory, and cultural analysis.

We are known for our broad view of the discipline, and understand \"literature\" to mean writing in all media, and its study to include all the ways in which texts have been produced, re-produced, circulated, and read, along with the modes of classification and the definitions of enjoyment used to understand them. The scholarly methods we employ, and in which we train our students, include close reading, historical and archival research, literary theory, the history of the book, media theory, and cultural analysis.
