Gafos       My current Curriculum Vitae                                                                      Research Interests My primary research interests focus on the time course of planning in phonology, the nature of phonological representations, and formalizing the link between speech perception and production. Methodologically, I am interested in how computational modeling and experimental data can be used together to investigate theoretical linguistic questions. The models I have been developing make explicit predictions for response times, linguistic judgments, and phonetic modulation that can be tested experimentally in both speech production and perception. I also have a longstanding interest in the phonetics and phonology of Russian.       My dissertation, The dynamics of phonological planning , was successfully defended in October 2012.

After that I moved to Connecticut to embark on a career in computer consulting--first doing database application development, then web development specializing in internationalization of web applications. I have now returned to pursue my longstanding interest in human language.       Non-linguistic interests include skiing/ ski racing , cooking , beach volleyball, wine, airplanes, singing.                                         &quot;That's all very fine in practice, but how does it work in theory?&quot; attrib.
