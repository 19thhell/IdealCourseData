In the new location, students have the opportunity to benefit from the numerous cultural, artistic, and academic institutions of this celebrated neighborhood, as well as to get to know the city through faculty-led visits and walking tours. The program offers regular day trips to places outside of the city, such as Chantilly, Giverny, and Versailles, and weekend excursions to locations that have included Avignon, the Loire Valley, Mont-Saint-Michel, and La Rochelle. These trips allow students to further embrace the richness, depth, and diversity of French history and civilization.   Studying at NYU Paris   Paris: city of revolution, exhilarating tumult of art and spectacle, cosmopolitan crossroads, capital of the world. French romanticist George Sand thought Parisians were \u201cthe most admirable people in the universe \u2013 grand, sublime, na\u00efve, and generous.\u201d Students who come to Paris join a long line of visitors to the city who contribute to its fervent mix\u2014its arts, its history, its politics\u2014and make the city their own. \u201cParis is a veritable ocean,\u201d Balzac wrote. \u201cDiscover it, describe it\u2026\u201d At NYU Paris, the city is your classroom.   The curriculum at NYU Paris focuses on the language, arts, history, literature, and politics of France and its relationships with the wider world. A world-class faculty provides context and support for students\u2019 academic work. Students with a limited background in French enroll in Program I, where all courses except for language are taught in English. Students proficient in French participate in Program II, which features a variety of courses taught in French. All students take a French language course appropriate to their level.   Coursework is enhanced by faculty-led trips in and around Paris, to world-renowned museums such as the Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e Picasso or to smaller galleries and exhibits, as well as to the opera, ballet, and theatre. Students receive a University of Paris student card and may take courses at the University of Paris or at the Institut d\u2019\u00c9tudes Politiques (Sciences Po). All students are carefully advised upon their arrival in Paris; students who opt to take courses in the French university system receive additional individualized in-house tutorial assistance.   Masters level graduate programs in French Literature, French Language &amp; Civilization, Museum Studies, and Teaching French as a Foreign Language also contribute to the overall academic quality of the Paris academic center.

Whether you're looking to experience a new culture, learn a new language, deepen your knowledge of an particular area, or all of the above, Summer Abroad offers students an immersive experience outside of the stresses of the normal semester.   NYU's Summer Abroad programs vary greatly \u2013 by program, location, and academic offerings \u2013 but one thing is certain: as a Summer Abroad student with NYU, you will have access to the full range of resources that are the hallmark of NYU's global network. You'll have a hands-on experience, living and learning in which ever city you choose, and learning and exploring with NYU faculty and students.
