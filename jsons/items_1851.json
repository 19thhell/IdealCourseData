I study comparative and ethnic politics, with a regional focus on Sub-Saharan Africa. My current book project investigates the micro-dynamics of ethnic conflict in contemporary Nigeria. In particular, I'm interested in the question of why ordinary people choose to participate in risky forms of collective action.                        Other ongoing research projects focus on post-conflict peacebuilding, the human costs of partition, electoral manipulation, ethnic identity formation, effective methods for asking sensitive questions, and the costs and benefits of respondent-driven sampling.                        In 2010, I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from Columbia University . During the 2009-2010 academic year, I was a fellow at Nuffield College , Oxford University ."}]}]
