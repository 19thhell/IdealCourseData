If you got here through an interest in Nanotechnology or DNA-Based Computation, you might be interested in learning about and joining the   International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and Engineering    Our laboratory is investigating unusual DNA molecules in model systems that use synthetic molecules. A major effort in our laboratory is devoted to DNA Nanotechnology .The attachment of specific sticky ends to a DNA branched junction enables the construction of stick figures, whose edges are double-stranded DNA. This approach has already been used to assemble a cube , a truncated octahedron , nanomechanical devices  and 2-D crystals and 3-D crystals  from DNA. Ultimate goals for this approach include the assembly of a biochip computer, nanorobotics and nanofabrication and the exploitation of the rational synthesis of periodic matter. This methodology also has applications to DNA Based Computing.     Our interest in branched DNA was originally stimulated by a desire to characterize Holliday junctions. These are four-arm branched DNA molecules that are found to be structural intermediates in genetic recombination. The focus of the work on these unusual molecules is to characterize the biophysics of recombination intermediates , particularly their structure, dynamics and thermodynamics, and to establish the relationship between these properties and their biological function. In the last few years, the symmetry, crossover topology and sequence-dependent thermodynamics of the 4-arm junction have been characterized and analyzed. The study of recombination intermediates has been extended by constructing and analyzing molecules with double crossovers, and by exploring broader classes of multi-stranded molecules, called antijunctions and mesojunctions. Recently, we have used Bowtie junctions to examine the properties of Holliday junctions.     Knotted DNA molecules have also been constructed, because they are recombination intermediate analogs, because they offer a window on stressed DNA, and because they may permit us to clone the complex catenanes that we make in our DNA nanotechnology program. The program on single-stranded Nucleic Acid Topology has led to characterization of the interactions of synthetic DNA knots with topoisomerases, to a general algorithm for the construction of any DNA knot, to the synthesis of a DNA molecule that can be built to yield four different topological species , to the discovery of an RNA topoisomerase , and to the construction of Borromean Rings .     The physical techniques used in the laboratory include X-ray crystallography, computer graphics-aided molecular modeling and design, AFM, FRET, gel electrophoresis and automated oligonucleotide synthesis. Our published work in these areas is summarized in the Structural Studies Bibliography .     Ned Seeman's biographical highlights.     Prof. Nadrian C.

If you got here through an interest in Nanotechnology or DNA-Based Computation, you might be interested in learning about and joining the   International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and Engineering    Our laboratory is investigating unusual DNA molecules in model systems that use synthetic molecules. A major effort in our laboratory is devoted to DNA Nanotechnology .The attachment of specific sticky ends to a DNA branched junction enables the construction of stick figures, whose edges are double-stranded DNA. This approach has already been used to assemble a cube , a truncated octahedron , nanomechanical devices  and 2-D crystals and 3-D crystals  from DNA. Ultimate goals for this approach include the assembly of a biochip computer, nanorobotics and nanofabrication and the exploitation of the rational synthesis of periodic matter. This methodology also has applications to DNA Based Computing.     Our interest in branched DNA was originally stimulated by a desire to characterize Holliday junctions. These are four-arm branched DNA molecules that are found to be structural intermediates in genetic recombination. The focus of the work on these unusual molecules is to characterize the biophysics of recombination intermediates , particularly their structure, dynamics and thermodynamics, and to establish the relationship between these properties and their biological function. In the last few years, the symmetry, crossover topology and sequence-dependent thermodynamics of the 4-arm junction have been characterized and analyzed. The study of recombination intermediates has been extended by constructing and analyzing molecules with double crossovers, and by exploring broader classes of multi-stranded molecules, called antijunctions and mesojunctions. Recently, we have used Bowtie junctions to examine the properties of Holliday junctions.     Knotted DNA molecules have also been constructed, because they are recombination intermediate analogs, because they offer a window on stressed DNA, and because they may permit us to clone the complex catenanes that we make in our DNA nanotechnology program. The program on single-stranded Nucleic Acid Topology has led to characterization of the interactions of synthetic DNA knots with topoisomerases, to a general algorithm for the construction of any DNA knot, to the synthesis of a DNA molecule that can be built to yield four different topological species , to the discovery of an RNA topoisomerase , and to the construction of Borromean Rings .     The physical techniques used in the laboratory include X-ray crystallography, computer graphics-aided molecular modeling and design, AFM, FRET, gel electrophoresis and automated oligonucleotide synthesis. Our published work in these areas is summarized in the Structural Studies Bibliography .     Ned Seeman's biographical highlights.     Prof. Nadrian C.

Structural DNA nanotechnology uses synthetic DNA molecules to create new materials a billionth of a meter in size.   NYU\u2019s Structural DNA Nanotechnology facility is directed by Nadrian Seeman , the Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor of Chemistry at NYU. Seeman founded and developed the field, which is now pursued by laboratories across the globe, more than a quarter century ago.   In June, Seeman was awarded the 2010 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience in recognition of his pioneering work in this area. The Kavli Prize, given every two years for \u201coutstanding research and seminal advances\u201d in astrophysics, nanoscience, and neuroscience, includes a cash award of $1 million to each recipient. The Kavli Prize is a partnership of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Kavli Foundation, and the Norwegian Ministry of Education and Research.   Under the NSF grant, the Structural DNA Nanotechnology facility will undergo an extensive renovation that will substantially improve its physical layout and bolster its cyberinfrastructure, allowing NYU researchers to maximize electronic data collection and analysis.   \u201cAs the founding site of structural DNA nanotechnology, the facility has become a nexus for innovation and for the training visitors from around the globe, ranging from graduate students to faculty,\u201d said Michael Ward, chair of NYU\u2019s Department of Chemistry. \u201cUpgrading the site will bolster NYU\u2019s competitive edge in the field by significantly enhancing its experimental capacity and creating a state-of-the-art laboratory setting.\u201d   The facility also trains at least three undergraduate and high school students on an annual basis. Many of these students have won awards based on their work. In recent years, these have included an Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award winner and three Intel Science Talent Search semi-finalists.
