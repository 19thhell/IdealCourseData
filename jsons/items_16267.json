Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty \u2013 and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.     The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also located in Brooklyn with the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine, in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.     And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi \u2013 the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university \u2013 and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.
