This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.

Through one course, on 20th-century politics and society, he traveled with his class to locations in Germany and Poland, where they toured the memorial site at Auschwitz, the former death camp. In another course, on contemporary Berlin, Alex\u2019s professor made use of what he called a \u201cflying classroom,\u201d meeting his class each week at a different historical location in the city. Through this same course, Alex met a woman whose father had been a Nazi official. She allowed the class to screen the documentary she had produced about national guilt, generational clashes, and cultural identity. Afterward, the students had a chance to speak with her directly about her experiences. Alex says, \u201cI can read or listen to a lecture anywhere in the world. Learning about Germany firsthand was true \u2018fieldwork\u2019 and was invaluable to my education.\u201d   Alex sees himself as a fiercely independent person. However, he says, \u201cMy entire life, I had lived within 15 miles of New York City. I chose NYU not only because it\u2019s an excellent school but also because of the professional opportunities New York City offers. That being said, I have always dwelled in a certain \u2018comfort zone.\u2019 Going abroad was a true test\u2014to leave my comfort zone and adapt to an unfamiliar world.\u201d                                                NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

This Global Network University model has emerged as a natural and logical extension of NYU\u2019s research and teaching agendas; flowing from our eco-systemic relation to New York City, the diversity of thought represented by all of our schools, colleges, and programs\u2014and our internationally connected and collaborative faculty. Students and faculty interact with their urban environment in countless meaningful and essential ways, using these locations as a major asset.   Students and faculty alike broaden the scope of vision and knowledge through international learning. Opportunities include study abroad programs, direct-exchange programs with world-renowned institutions, and curriculum-driven international programming offered through the specific schools or departments. All locations within the network are also accessible for individual research that springs from individual academic ideas and goals.   Access to the World   NYU has never thought of itself as a gated community. It has always encouraged its students to think of themselves as participants in and shapers of a complex and changing environment. Indeed, part of NYU\u2019s teaching mission consists in preparing students for lives in a diverse world, and faculty at NYU believe that such preparation is most effective when the outside world is not held at bay. This same principle holds true as we create a Global Network University that is both \u201cin and of the city\u201d and \u201cin and of the world.\u201d   Our locations beyond our campus in New York City include NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Shanghai, TischAsia in Singapore, NYU Law in Singapore, and 10 academic sites in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany, Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC.   Direct exchange programs with 12 distinguished partner institutions, 27 summer session locations, an ever-changing roster of intersession programming offered by NYU\u2019s various schools, colleges, and programs, and curriculum-driven initiatives expand the global network\u2014from Beijing to Johannesburg, Santiago to Vienna.   Around the world, students work closely with faculty and with their peers on shared commitments. They apply what they learn and develop the skills and qualities\u2014both needed and expected in this increasingly integrated, global climate\u2014to make a real difference in the world.                                                      Study Abroad and Study Away International education is a long-standing part of New York University's global mission which includes a wide range of initiatives both in the United States and abroad to facilitate the exchange of knowledge across international boundaries.
