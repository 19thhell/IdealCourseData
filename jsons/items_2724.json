In the Action Laboratory, we study behavioral flexibility--how people learn to adapt to changes in their bodies and skills and to variations in the environment.    We challenge infants, children, and adults with novel predicaments such as crawling over bridges, squeezing through apertures, brachiating over monkey bars, and reaching for targets with the body in motion. We observe people's actions using computerized video coding (Datavyu) and state-of-the-art recording technologies including gait carpets, motion tracking, head-mounted eye-tracking and remote eye-tracking.
