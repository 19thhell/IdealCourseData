About the Center          The Center for Real Estate Finance Research at NYU Stern aims to foster thought leadership in real estate finance, to support the teaching mission of the school to produce future leaders in the real estate industry, and to promote dialogue with our alumni and industry leaders in the field.    Vice Dean Ingo Walter and Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh have transformed an already outstanding foundation of curriculum and financial research, into a formal Real Estate Finance academic concentration at NYU Stern. This initiative is being driven by a large student demand and increasing corporate recruiting interest, and will complement the Finance department's leadership in finance research, which has generated publications and books such as the recently published Guaranteed to Fail. Stern recognizes that real estate, a core financial asset, is a fundamental part of the economy and business and has taken the next steps to institutionalize the School's pedagogy in the area.

About the Center          The Center for Real Estate Finance Research at NYU Stern aims to foster thought leadership in real estate finance, to support the teaching mission of the school to produce future leaders in the real estate industry, and to promote dialogue with our alumni and industry leaders in the field.    Vice Dean Ingo Walter and Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh have transformed an already outstanding foundation of curriculum and financial research, into a formal Real Estate Finance academic concentration at NYU Stern. This initiative is being driven by a large student demand and increasing corporate recruiting interest, and will complement the Finance department's leadership in finance research, which has generated publications and books such as the recently published Guaranteed to Fail. Stern recognizes that real estate, a core financial asset, is a fundamental part of the economy and business and has taken the next steps to institutionalize the School's pedagogy in the area.
