The study, which appears in the journal Linguistics and Philosophy, reveals that monkey calls have a more sophisticated structure than was commonly thought.   \u201cOur findings show that Campbell\u2019s monkeys have a distinction between roots and suffixes, and that their combination allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of danger,\u201d explains the study\u2019s lead author, Philippe Schlenker, a Senior Researcher at Institut Jean-Nicod within France\u2019s National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) and a Global Distinguished Professor at New York University.   The paper may be downloaded here .     The combined team of linguists and primatologists analyzed alarm calls of Campbell\u2019s monkeys on two sites: the Tai forest in Ivory Coast and Tiwai Island in Sierra Leone. Notably, monkey predators on the two sites differ: the primates are threatened by eagles on Tiwai Island and by eagles and leopards in the Tai Forest.   Using transcriptions of these monkey calls gathered in field experiments involving playbacks of predator calls (e.g. eagle shrieks and leopard growls), the researchers found greater complexity in expression than previously understood as well as differences in alarm calls between the two locations.   Confirming with linguistic means some hypotheses initially made by primatologists, their analysis showed that these calls make a distinction between roots (especially \u201chok\u201d and \u201ckrak\u201d) and suffixes (-oo), and that their combination allows the monkeys to describe both the nature of a threat and its degree of danger. For instance, \u201chok\u201d warns of serious aerial threats\u2014usually eagles\u2014whereas \u201chok-oo\u201d can be used for a variety of general aerial disturbances; in effect the suffix -oo serves as a kind of attenuator.   Moreover, their results suggest that the calls are not used in the same way in the Tai Forest and on Tiwai Island. For instance, \u201ckrak\u201d usually functions as a leopard alarm call in Tai, but as a general alarm call \u2013 to warn of all sorts of disturbances, including eagles \u2013 on Tiwai. The article seeks to explain why this \u2018dialectal variation\u2019 is found.   The authors\u2019 preferred analysis is based on the device of \u2018implicatures,\u2019 borrowed from the pragmatics of human languages. It posits that the meaning of a word can be enriched when it competes with a more informative alternative \u2013 for instance, \u201cpossible\u201d competes with \u201ccertain,\u201d which is more informative, and for this reason \u201cpossible\u201d usually comes to mean \u201cpossible but not certain\u201d (for instance in: \u201cIt\u2019s possible that John is the culprit\u201d \u2013 which implies that this is not a certainty). The authors propose that \u201ckrak\u201d always has a meaning of general alarm, but that in Tai it comes to be enriched by competition with \u201chok\u201d (meaning: aerial threat) and \u201ckrak-oo\u201d (meaning: weak threat) \u2013 with the result that it is enriched with a \u2018not \u201chok\u201d \u2019 component (hence: the threat is a non-aerial threat) and a \u2018not \u201ckrak-oo\u201d \u2019 component (hence: the threat is not weak). This yields a meaning of a \u2018serious ground-related threat,\u2019 closely associated with leopards.   In the long term, Schlenker observes, the research should help initiate the development of a form of \u201cprimate linguistics\u201d\u2014the application of sophisticated methods from contemporary formal linguistics to systems of animal communication.
