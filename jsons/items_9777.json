Overview    The master&rsquo;s program in mathematics education is taught by full- and part-time faculty with a wide range of classroom experience, scholarly publications and long-time involvement with professional associations. The program emphasizes sound content knowledge in mathematics; current issues and trends in mathematics education; state of the art instructional materials; pedagogical approaches that promote students' conceptual understanding and address anticipated learning difficulties; and teaching methods that provoke critical thought and foster inquiry-based learning. Students in the master's degree program with appropriate mathematical background may take their graduate mathematics courses at NYU's world-renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.    Extensive school-based fieldwork (100 hours) is required prior to student teaching , both to familiarize students with urban educational environments and to enable them to develop classroom strategies that are innovative and appropriate for teaching today's students. You will complete some of these 100 hours of fieldwork during your junior or senior year.    The pivotal field experience of the program consists of two semesters of student teaching, one at the middle and one at the high school level. Through this experience, MA students &ndash; mentored by their cooperating teachers and NYU field supervisors &ndash; are given increasing responsibilities for teaching in the New York City public schools.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, B.S .    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual B.A. Math/M.A. Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a B.A. Math/M.A. Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their B.A. from the College of Arts and Science and an M.A. in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the B.A./M.A. Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual degree programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    Minors    * Teacher Education * Global and Urban Education Studies * Mathematics Education Minor for Yeshiva University Students    Mathematics Education, M.A .    The master's degree program in mathematics education prepares students to teach at the middle school through high school level.

Mathematics also helps us all with the increasing complexities of daily living &ndash; family budgets, insurance and mortgages, tax returns, and investment and retirement funds. With the challenges of the new century both at home and abroad, the demand for outstanding mathematics teachers in our schools has become critical.    Mathematics Education, B.S .    In the Bachelor of Science Program in Teaching Mathematics, Grades 7-12, in the Department of Teaching and Learning, our goal is to prepare teachers who can help their students think critically about their teaching and devise ways to improve mathematics education. We focus on current developments in mathematics teaching nationwide and keep the program up-to-date by integrating into our curriculum recommendations from teaching organizations and national commissions. We address issues of ethnicity and gender in mathematics education and work with students to develop strategies to help underrepresented minorities and females surmount learning barriers.    Accelerated Dual B.A. Math/M.A. Mathematics Education (for CAS Students)    The Department of Teaching and Learning and the College of Arts and Science offer several accelerated dual degree programs , including a B.A. Math/M.A. Mathematics Education track , that allow students majoring in selected disciplines to simultaneously complete both their B.A. from the College of Arts and Science and an M.A. in Teacher Education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in only five years.    Students admitted to one of the B.A./M.A. Teacher Education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees in a shortened time and at less cost than is normally the case. These programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level.    All dual degree programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in New York State and most states around the country.    Minors    * Teacher Education * Global and Urban Education Studies * Mathematics Education Minor for Yeshiva University Students    Mathematics Education, M.A .
