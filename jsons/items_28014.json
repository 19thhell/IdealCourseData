The NYU.edu website uses Verdana as its main system font.   Headers   The NYU.edu site uses headers in logical hierarchy (ex: H2 is sub category of H1 and H3 is subcategory of H2 &amp; etc.). There is only one H1 per page as the page title. This H1 is as close to the convention of the page filename as possible to improve search engine optimization.

On content pages, the dominant element is always situated in the left top corner of a page. This is where the title and primary content is located. Everything else on the page is considered secondary to this main element, but secondary elements also have a hierarchy.   Separate Content: Defining what is &quot;Primary&quot; and &quot;Secondary&quot;   The informational content on a Web site can have various content types: It can be displayed as text, images, videos, multimedia presentations, audio files, slideshows, or promotions. Within every content type, it is important to separate the \u201cmost important\u201d from the \u201cleast important\u201d \u2013 or in our terms, \u201cprimary\u201d and \u201csecondary\u201d content \u2013 and classify the hierarchy of importance of what we would like to communicate to the public (site viewer).   Considering the interactive character of the internet and the limited space on the screen, it is important to wisely determine your site\u2019s most important goals when choosing to publish the content.   Main text content can have other related content. For example: photo galleries or videos, interactive forms, or multimedia presentations. It is up to the author to determine what the most important, related content is and its hierarchy within the page.   Making choices is the key to successful layout. Some believe every topic is important and so it may be hard to make these choices. However, they do have to be made, particularly when one subject leads into another, or because it is easier to read from primary to secondary content then reading an undistinguished block of the same size content.           Photography   Photography used on the NYU.edu site must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website.   We recommend using the NYU Photo Bureau for University photography needs to help ensure that you have both the appropriate level of quality and the permission to use images on the University website.        Graphics   While the use of graphics on the NYU.edu website is limited, any graphics used must be web-ready and must be approved for use on the website, and must follow guidelines provided in the University Identity and Style Guide .   We recommend using high-quality graphics created by designers rather than line or clip art.         Videos   We recommend that videos on the web are no longer than 2 minutes in length and don't require proprietary software for site viewers to watch. We also strongly recommend that all videos contain captions.     NYU.edu uses the JW Player by LongTail as its local video player.
