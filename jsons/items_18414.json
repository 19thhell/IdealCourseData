Reciprocity   (Using Other Law School Career Services Offices)   If you are looking for a job outside the metropolitan New York City area, we can make a request on your behalf to obtain access to the career services office of another law school. Requests are limited to one school per geographic region. It is important to understand that, as each law school has its own reciprocity policy, there may be varying restrictions on the services and resources provided, and access to an office may be limited during certain times of the year. (Please note that New York University School of Law's reciprocity season extends from November 16 through June 30, therefore, requests on behalf of our students and graduates can be made only during that time period. In addition, as our policy anticipates in-person use of our office by students and graduates of other law schools, we are only able to request the same service in return.) The reciprocity policies of most law schools are posted on the Web site of the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) at http://www.nalp.org/reciprocitypolicies . Please check this site when making a decision as to which law school you wish to utilize, then contact our office to obtain a Reciprocity Request form.
