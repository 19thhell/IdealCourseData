The NYU Steinhardt Program in Educational Theatre is recognized as a major contributor to research and praxis in applied theatre. Faculty has devised and written numerous applied theatre projects which have been profiled at our NYU Forum series in theatre and public health, teaching artistry, citizenship, multiculturalism, and theatre for social change. Faculty serves on major peer reviewed editorial boards dedicated to applied theatre, including Applied Theatre Researcher, ArtsPraxis , Journal of Applied Arts and Health, Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance. Applied Theatre is multi-disciplinary and involves links with other research disciplines and agencies in the humanities, social sciences, and wellness and health. The focus is on the uses of theatre to educate and to grapple with complex social issues. The Program&rsquo;s Applied Theatre experiences have included projects about immigration and refugees, racism and prejudice, domestic violence, queer voices, bullying, youth suicide and adolescent identity. Students of Applied Theatre have worked in a range of locations &ndash; from homes for the elderly, community and recreational sites, to prison facilities.

For Application Deadlines, Costs, Registration and more, visit: http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/global/graduate/apply    England, DRAMA IN EDUCATION    This intensive course is composed of four strands: practical drama workshops including analysis of process; observation followed by participation in drama classes at selected London schools; related aspects, including lectures, seminars, and discussions with British experts in the field (as well as theatrical performances at Royal National theatres, Fringe, mainstream, and Stratford-upon-Avon); and learning from experts how to devise and implement drama structures, including the use of process drama and teacher-in-role. Daily improvisation and theatre movement sessions are followed by drama workshops, lectures, and seminar discussions. Participants observe work with London drama teachers for \"in-service training,\" and subsequently lead drama classes in selected London schools. These experiences are supported by analysis with a number of British specialists who provide perspectives of drama in education. Faculty includes Judith Ackroyd, Jo Boulton, Anthony Banks, Jonathan Jones, Damian MacBeth, Helen Nicholson, Cecily O'Neill and Philip Taylor.     Ireland, COMMUNITY-ENGAGED THEATRE    The word \"audience\" can refer to many different groups or communities: children in a classroom, patrons in a theatre, spectators on a street. How do we as practitioners engage an audience with our work in the theatre and in the drama classroom? How do we as artists and educators make theatre accessible to a variety of populations, regardless of past experience with the art form? How do we facilitate the creation of original theatrical work with populations unfamiliar with the art form? How do we function as both artists and educators in these kinds of environments? Participants in this course encounter various approaches that help to answer these questions through experiences with Ireland's finest drama practitioners and theatre artists, with affiliations through the Upstate Theatre, Queens College Belfast, and the Samuel Beckett Centre at Trinity College Dublin. Skills that are explored include facilitation, devising, and playwriting/adaptation, along with approaches to using dramatic activities to create context for theatre work. Experiences include lectures and demonstrations, attendance at plays and performances, visits to cultural sites throughout Dublin where community-engaged work takes place, and the creation of original theatre works to be shared with a public audience at the Samuel Beckett Centre. Faculty includes Nancy Smithner, Nora Stillman, Joanna Parkes and Jennifer Cooke.    Puerto Rico, THEATRE PRACTICES    This course explores broad questions about drama and its practice in educational, aesthetic and applied settings. Radical approaches to applied theatre will be considered, especially those shaped by Freire and Boal. Students will develop a vocabulary of theatrical skills (Physical Theatre/Mask) for use in the implementation and integration of dramatic strategies into community-based work. We will also explore the ways in which drama provides contexts for developing change.    Students will read widely, observe the ways in which theory meets practice, and reflect on their own evolving understanding of the field of drama in education in a wide range of aesthetic applications. Through analysis of the contemporary theoretical foundations, students will probe ideas, read widely and reflect on thier own evolving understanding of drama in education.

Daily improvisation and theatre movement sessions are followed by drama workshops, lectures, and seminar discussions. Participants observe work with London drama teachers for \"in-service training,\" and subsequently lead drama classes in selected London schools. These experiences are supported by analysis with a number of British specialists who provide perspectives of drama in education. Faculty includes Judith Ackroyd, Jo Boulton, Anthony Banks, Jonathan Jones, Damian MacBeth, Helen Nicholson, Cecily O'Neill and Philip Taylor.     Ireland, COMMUNITY-ENGAGED THEATRE    The word \"audience\" can refer to many different groups or communities: children in a classroom, patrons in a theatre, spectators on a street. How do we as practitioners engage an audience with our work in the theatre and in the drama classroom? How do we as artists and educators make theatre accessible to a variety of populations, regardless of past experience with the art form? How do we facilitate the creation of original theatrical work with populations unfamiliar with the art form? How do we function as both artists and educators in these kinds of environments? Participants in this course encounter various approaches that help to answer these questions through experiences with Ireland's finest drama practitioners and theatre artists, with affiliations through the Upstate Theatre, Queens College Belfast, and the Samuel Beckett Centre at Trinity College Dublin. Skills that are explored include facilitation, devising, and playwriting/adaptation, along with approaches to using dramatic activities to create context for theatre work. Experiences include lectures and demonstrations, attendance at plays and performances, visits to cultural sites throughout Dublin where community-engaged work takes place, and the creation of original theatre works to be shared with a public audience at the Samuel Beckett Centre. Faculty includes Nancy Smithner, Nora Stillman, Joanna Parkes and Jennifer Cooke.    Puerto Rico, THEATRE PRACTICES    This course explores broad questions about drama and its practice in educational, aesthetic and applied settings. Radical approaches to applied theatre will be considered, especially those shaped by Freire and Boal. Students will develop a vocabulary of theatrical skills (Physical Theatre/Mask) for use in the implementation and integration of dramatic strategies into community-based work. We will also explore the ways in which drama provides contexts for developing change.    Students will read widely, observe the ways in which theory meets practice, and reflect on their own evolving understanding of the field of drama in education in a wide range of aesthetic applications. Through analysis of the contemporary theoretical foundations, students will probe ideas, read widely and reflect on thier own evolving understanding of drama in education.
