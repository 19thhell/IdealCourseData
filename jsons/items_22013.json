The first stage of the course will explore the  wide array of styles that comprise and influence Hip-Hop movement. This course  will not only introduce steps, but investigate root moves and historical  context that shaped contemporary Hip-Hop today. During the course, students  will also discuss the current and emerging trends of the genre. As an  ever-evolving dance, this class will focus on budding dance styles, such as  Flexing, Lite feet and Finger Tuts, comparing and contrasting those to case  studies of past styles that emerged, (or re-emerged) to become heavily  popularized such as Gliding, Krumping and Waacking. Additionally students will  explore the globalized nature of Hip-Hop. To see the full evolution, students  will see how other cultures have embraced and left their mark street styles,  and how international dance battles and competitions have emerged, ultimately  changing the landscape of Hip-Hop dance. Over the course of study students will  begin to realize the complexity, the history and the varying opinions focused  around Hip-Hop. Check Albert for course schedule.
