Baum       Tuesday, 2 p.m.-5:00 p.m. Call#: 71467                                 Pre-requisite:   Photo 1 for Non-Majors or by special permission.  Students will need a digital  SLR camera and a portable external hard drive of at least 250 GB. Students will also need to   purchase printing paper later in the term.                                     Photo 2 for NM is intended for students who have taken an analog photography  class such as Photo I for Non-majors but have limited or no experience with  digital photographic tools. In addition to a review of essential camera  theory and technique, this course will cover the fundamentals of digital  equipment and materials and embrace digital technology for its potential to  push photography's aesthetic and conceptual boundaries. Topics to be covered  include the use of a digital SLR, the basics of Adobe Photoshop as well as more  advanced techniques such as working with layers and masks, the power of RAW  files, making fine-art ink jet prints and film scanning. This class, however,  will not focus solely on technical training but will engage photography as a  means of visual communication, emphasizing an understanding of light and the  concept of \u201cseeing photographically\u201d. During the term, students will be  encouraged to initiate and sustain a focused project over an extended period of  time. Class time will be used for demonstration of new techniques,  supervised computer-lab sessions, group critique of student work as well as  looking at the work of photographic masters through slide lectures and video  screenings. While the materials we use to make pictures continue to  evolve, the visual awareness and thoughtfulness that it takes to make  successful photographs will never change. This course has a $350 nonrefundable lab fee.
