Students will be assigned to one section each week.   Digital Newsroom is a new course offering that will combine TV Newscast and iBeat Reporting to allow graduate students to develop a comprehensive set of skills that will prepare them for a career in video journalism.\u00a0 It is a holistic that will expand the scope of the newscast and meet the needs of a wide range of students.\u00a0 It will also introduce the idea of entrepreneurial journalism for those students with a video emphasis.   The merged classes will function as cross training in a real newsroom environment as opposed to learning each function in isolation.\u00a0 We believe that this approach will allow students to better experience the energy, collaborative nature and deadline pressure of a daily news operation.\u00a0 By bringing these two classes together students will be able to develop their reporting and writing skills, achieve fluency with a wide range of newsroom production tools and gain basic understanding of how to produce a newscast and, through a rotation, focus more heavily on field reporting, advanced editing and camera techniques, and live reporting.\u00a0 The class will also encourage media crossover and experimentation.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, students will be able to use iPhones and other mobile devices in newsgathering and editing. \u00a0   Over the semester students will rotate among each typical newsroom position.\u00a0 These positions include reporter, writer, executive producer, director, anchor, camera and so on.\u00a0 Students will be given the opportunity to spend more time focusing on a position that interests them most, yet they will be exposed to all the positions.   \u00a0NewsDoc/RTN/RNY Priority                                               Arthur L.

Students will be assigned to one section each week.   Digital Newsroom is a new course offering that will combine TV Newscast and iBeat Reporting to allow graduate students to develop a comprehensive set of skills that will prepare them for a career in video journalism.\u00a0 It is a holistic that will expand the scope of the newscast and meet the needs of a wide range of students.\u00a0 It will also introduce the idea of entrepreneurial journalism for those students with a video emphasis.   The merged classes will function as cross training in a real newsroom environment as opposed to learning each function in isolation.\u00a0 We believe that this approach will allow students to better experience the energy, collaborative nature and deadline pressure of a daily news operation.\u00a0 By bringing these two classes together students will be able to develop their reporting and writing skills, achieve fluency with a wide range of newsroom production tools and gain basic understanding of how to produce a newscast and, through a rotation, focus more heavily on field reporting, advanced editing and camera techniques, and live reporting.\u00a0 The class will also encourage media crossover and experimentation.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, students will be able to use iPhones and other mobile devices in newsgathering and editing. \u00a0   Over the semester students will rotate among each typical newsroom position.\u00a0 These positions include reporter, writer, executive producer, director, anchor, camera and so on.\u00a0 Students will be given the opportunity to spend more time focusing on a position that interests them most, yet they will be exposed to all the positions.   \u00a0NewsDoc/RTN/RNY Priority                                               Arthur L.

The School is repositioning itself to bridge the gap between academia and industry, providing students with in-demand skill sets that are attractive to the industries it serves. The change coincides with the School\u2019s 80 th anniversary\u2014a milestone year, that also will include the rollout of new academic programs, a series of leadership events, and a bold new advertising campaign.     Preparing students for the real world  At a time when the value of higher education is in question, with the latest figures showing that only 14 percent of Americans\u2014and 11 percent of business leaders\u2014strongly agree that graduates have the necessary skills and competencies needed to succeed in today\u2019s workplace, the need for applied professional studies is becoming increasingly critical for global competitiveness and the advancement of industry.    Dennis Di Lorenzo, Harvey J. Stedman dean of the NYU School of Professional Studies, noted, &quot;In higher education, we have long heard employers say that there is a disconnect between academia and business\u2014that we, as educators, are not graduating students with the requisite skills and real-world experience that they desire in candidates for current and future jobs. At the NYU School of Professional Studies, we are narrowing that gap by offering the best of both worlds: high-quality undergraduate and graduate programs with leading-edge industry expertise that combine theory with practice. The School\u2019s new name befits its unique ability to shape the future of the labor force and major industry, preparing students for the jobs that exist today and those that have yet to be created. I am excited that we are poised for continued growth, innovation, and leadership as we enter our 80 th year.&quot;    The NYU School of Professional Studies is leading the reinvention of practical learning, offering new and innovative degree programs and curricula that are focused on providing individuals with the skills they need to succeed in both current and emerging industries, including real estate, hospitality, sports business, global affairs, marketing, information technology, and many more. The School provides skills that are immediately applicable in the workplace\u2014a very valuable asset for those who are just launching their careers, as well as for those who are interested in career advancement or change.     Bucking national trends in enrollment and accessibility  With postsecondary enrollment continuing to decline and a significant slowdown  expected over the next decade compared to last, the NYU School of Professional Studies has experienced a record 25% increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollment over the past three years, and is continuing to strengthen efforts to prepare students for the current and future workforce.    The School also is adapting to meet the needs of changing industry demands, developing new curricula, and delivering more programs online for greater accessibility.     Fueling innovation and opportunity through industry collaboration  The NYU School of Professional Studies has more than 100 full-time faculty members, 2,000+ adjunct professors, and tens of thousands of students and alumni around the world, who are at the forefront of industry, fueling innovation and shaping the future of education and the global marketplace.    Whether specializing in real estate development or digital media, fundraising or publishing, the School\u2019s faculty members know where their industries are heading because they are on the front lines and in the C-suite, and understand first-hand, what skills students need to enter into and to innovate in those fields. These industry connections also prove valuable to students, opening many doors as they begin the job hunt or advance in their careers. Through industry events, networking opportunities, site visits, and internships, the School collaborates with top companies and organizations in the U.S. and around the globe, including General Electric, the NBA, Credit Suisse Group, Lowes Hotels &amp; Resorts, Silverstein Properties, and Cond\u00e9 Nast, among hundreds of others, to provide access and exposure to students in their fields of interest.

Students will be assigned to one section each week.   Digital Newsroom is a new course offering that will combine TV Newscast and iBeat Reporting to allow graduate students to develop a comprehensive set of skills that will prepare them for a career in video journalism.\u00a0 It is a holistic that will expand the scope of the newscast and meet the needs of a wide range of students.\u00a0 It will also introduce the idea of entrepreneurial journalism for those students with a video emphasis.   The merged classes will function as cross training in a real newsroom environment as opposed to learning each function in isolation.\u00a0 We believe that this approach will allow students to better experience the energy, collaborative nature and deadline pressure of a daily news operation.\u00a0 By bringing these two classes together students will be able to develop their reporting and writing skills, achieve fluency with a wide range of newsroom production tools and gain basic understanding of how to produce a newscast and, through a rotation, focus more heavily on field reporting, advanced editing and camera techniques, and live reporting.\u00a0 The class will also encourage media crossover and experimentation.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, students will be able to use iPhones and other mobile devices in newsgathering and editing. \u00a0   Over the semester students will rotate among each typical newsroom position.\u00a0 These positions include reporter, writer, executive producer, director, anchor, camera and so on.\u00a0 Students will be given the opportunity to spend more time focusing on a position that interests them most, yet they will be exposed to all the positions.   \u00a0NewsDoc/RTN/RNY Priority                                               Arthur L.

The School is repositioning itself to bridge the gap between academia and industry, providing students with in-demand skill sets that are attractive to the industries it serves. The change coincides with the School\u2019s 80 th anniversary\u2014a milestone year, that also will include the rollout of new academic programs, a series of leadership events, and a bold new advertising campaign.     Preparing students for the real world  At a time when the value of higher education is in question, with the latest figures showing that only 14 percent of Americans\u2014and 11 percent of business leaders\u2014strongly agree that graduates have the necessary skills and competencies needed to succeed in today\u2019s workplace, the need for applied professional studies is becoming increasingly critical for global competitiveness and the advancement of industry.    Dennis Di Lorenzo, Harvey J. Stedman dean of the NYU School of Professional Studies, noted, &quot;In higher education, we have long heard employers say that there is a disconnect between academia and business\u2014that we, as educators, are not graduating students with the requisite skills and real-world experience that they desire in candidates for current and future jobs. At the NYU School of Professional Studies, we are narrowing that gap by offering the best of both worlds: high-quality undergraduate and graduate programs with leading-edge industry expertise that combine theory with practice. The School\u2019s new name befits its unique ability to shape the future of the labor force and major industry, preparing students for the jobs that exist today and those that have yet to be created. I am excited that we are poised for continued growth, innovation, and leadership as we enter our 80 th year.&quot;    The NYU School of Professional Studies is leading the reinvention of practical learning, offering new and innovative degree programs and curricula that are focused on providing individuals with the skills they need to succeed in both current and emerging industries, including real estate, hospitality, sports business, global affairs, marketing, information technology, and many more. The School provides skills that are immediately applicable in the workplace\u2014a very valuable asset for those who are just launching their careers, as well as for those who are interested in career advancement or change.     Bucking national trends in enrollment and accessibility  With postsecondary enrollment continuing to decline and a significant slowdown  expected over the next decade compared to last, the NYU School of Professional Studies has experienced a record 25% increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollment over the past three years, and is continuing to strengthen efforts to prepare students for the current and future workforce.    The School also is adapting to meet the needs of changing industry demands, developing new curricula, and delivering more programs online for greater accessibility.

Whether specializing in real estate development or digital media, fundraising or publishing, the School\u2019s faculty members know where their industries are heading because they are on the front lines and in the C-suite, and understand first-hand, what skills students need to enter into and to innovate in those fields.
