Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.

Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .              STUDENT  VISAS AND ORIENTATION      Matters  pertaining to student visas and new student orientation are administered by the  Office of Global Services (OGS), 561 La Guardia Place, 1st Floor; 212-998-4720.  In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.          Deadlines  for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      Students  interested in the post-baccalaureate premedical program should contact the  Preprofessional Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University,  Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688;  212-998-8160.              NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.              ADMISSIONS  APPLICATION FILING DEADLINES      Freshman Applicants for Admission:   Notification  Plan Application  Deadline Notification  Date Early  Decision I November  1 December  15 Early  Decision II January  1 February  15 Regular  Decision January  1 April  1           For  entrance in January (transfer applicants only), applications for admission,  including all required supporting credentials, must be received by November 1.         For  entrance in the summer sessions (transfer applicants only), applications should  be received by April 1.          Applications  for admission received after these dates are unlikely to be considered for  admission except under special circumstances. Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .

In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.

NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

The other four points cannot be applied towards  psychology major or minor requirements.      19 A Level/Pre-U credits cannot be  counted towards the religious studies major or minor.      20 Sociology majors may request  departmental approval for counting four of the eight A Level/Pre-U credits  toward the major as one of the three required SOC-UA electives. However, the  credits never exempt students from any of the introductory courses in Sociology  (SOC-UA 1, 2, 3).

Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.                                Country-Specific Examination Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing may be awarded for country-specific examinations according to the following standards:                                                          Commonwealth Caribbean Region                               Exam: CXC Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     Minimum Score: II     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      France                               Exam: Baccalaur\u00e9at   Minimum Score: 12     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Germany                               Exam: Abitur     Minimum Score: 10     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Italy                               Exam: Esame di Stato (Maturit\u00e1)     Minimum Score: 7     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 4 credits/points                                                                      United Kingdom                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points       Exam: Cambridge Pre-U     Minimum Score: M2     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Singapore                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Switzerland                               Exam: Matura     Minimum Score: 4.5     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

How do I get one?   For instructions on obtaining transcripts, please find the information here . NYU does not accept transcript requests via email.      How do I calculate my GPA?    You can calculate your Grade Point Average (GPA) by determining the total of all    grade points earned and dividing that figure by the total number of credits    completed. For example, a student who has completed one 4-credit course with    a grade of A, one 4-credit course with a grade of B+, and one 2-credit course with    a grade of B has a grade point average of 3.52. This was computed as follows:        Credits\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Point Value            4 credits x 4.0 (A)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16.0    4 credits x 3.3 (B+)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.2    2 credits x 3.0 (B)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.0\u00a0    10 credits\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a035.2        Now, divide the total point value (35.2) by the number of credits earned (10).    The total is your GPA (3.52).        Grades for work done at other institutions including those earned while matriculating    in other institutions are not included in a student\u2019s grade point average.    There are no A+, D-, or F+ grades.          How do I bring in my AP, A-Level, IB, or previously completed college credits?    The Advanced Placement Program (AP), the International Baccalaureate Program, and results of some foreign maturity certificate examinations may enable you to receive credit. Please meet with an adviser to assess your scores for which credit may be given. If you are seeking to apply credit for previous college work, you must submit an official transcript and a syllabus or course description. Credits will be applicable only if the content of the course is similar to an equivalent NYU course. More information regarding credits may be found here .            How do I take a course Pass/Fail?    As a Liberal Studies Core Program student, you may elect one pass/fail option each semester, including the summer session. A total of 16 points may be taken pass/fail while in the Liberal Studies Program. The pass/fail option is not available for courses completed at non-NYU institutions.    The pass/fail option is unavailable for: 1. Courses in the LS Core Program Curriculum (Writing I &amp; II, Cultural Foundations I, II &amp; II, Social Foundations I, II &amp; III); 2. Required coursework towards a major and/or minor; and 3. Courses under the Morse Academic Plan requirements for CAS or core requirements for other NYU schools. To take a course pass/fail, you must submit a Pass/Fail Option form to the Liberal Studies Advising Center by the end of the fifth week of classes during the fall and spring terms, and by the end of the second week of classes for the summer sessions. Please meet with an academic advisor to submit the form.      How do I take an incomplete in a course?   If you encounter a serious problem based on unpredictable circumstances, it is at the discretion of the instructor whether or not to grant an incomplete at the end of a semester. Incompletes may only be awarded through prior written agreement (e.g. an Incomplete Contract) between the student and the professor before the end of the course.      How do I withdraw from a course? What is the significance of receiving a &ldquo;W&rdquo; for a dropped class?    To withdraw from a course, you must submit a Withdrawal form to the Liberal Studies Advising Center by the end of the tenth week of classes during the fall and spring terms. The Assistant Director of Students must review and approve your request to withdraw. Once approved, a &ldquo;W&rdquo; will be recorded on your transcript and will not be included in the calculation of your grade point average. Specific deadline dates for this semester may be found here .    The significance of a &ldquo;W&rdquo; can vary depending on your particular circumstances. If you have a single &ldquo;W&rdquo; on your transcript, and you have a legitimate and justifiable reason for having withdrawn from a class, then a &ldquo;W&rdquo; should not be a serious cause for concern. However, if you have &ldquo;W&rsquo;s&rdquo; in multiple courses or consecutive semesters, or if you have withdrawn from a particular class multiple times, this may be interpreted as a cause for concern by someone reviewing your transcript.      What happens if I fail a course?   If you fail a core course required by the Liberal Studies Core Program (Writing I &amp; II, Cultural Foundations I, II &amp; II, Social Foundations I, II &amp; III), you must retake the course and receive a passing grade to be allowed to transfer to a degree program.   Failing non-required courses impacts your grade point averages such that you may need to retake them to satisfy transfer or major requirements.      What is a passing grade? Can I repeat a course?    A &ldquo;D&rdquo; is considered a passing grade. In some cases, you may need to repeat a course for a higher grade. Though both grades will still appear on your transcript, the grade you earn for the repeated course will be factored into your grade point average; the first grade is no longer calculated in the grade point average.        How do I take a leave of absence from the NYU?    If you need to take a semester off due various circumstances, please obtain an official leave of absence from the Assistant Director of Students, Leah Guarino-Ramirez, before the beginning of the semester. If you do not obtain an official leave of absence, you will need to apply for readmission to NYU. A leave may be requested for one semester or for the entire academic year.    You may apply for a medical leave of absence at any time. Medical leaves will be granted upon the recommendation of a physician, the Student Health Center , or Counseling and Wellness Services . Program changes may also be requested based on medical conditions.    If you leave for medical or psychological reasons, you will be required to show medical documentation stating that you are able physically and/or emotionally to continue school. In addition, if you took a leave of absence for psychological reasons, you will also be evaluated by NYU\u2019s University Counseling office before returning to school.      How do I take a military leave of absence from the University?    If you need to take a military leave of absence, please contact Leah Guarino-Ramirez in the Liberal Studies Advising Center.        How do I withdraw from the University?    If you are withdrawing from the University, please meet with Leah Guarino-Ramirez , Assistant Director of Students, at the Liberal Studies Program Advising Center as soon as possible. In addition, if you are staying in University Housing, you will be asked to provide proof of withdrawal from the LSP Advising Center so that you will not be charged for future semesters. Please come to the Advising Center in person to obtain the necessary paperwork.      What are the requirements to successfully transition?    Students entering in the Fall Semester of 2011 and later must maintain good academic standing (2.0) to transfer to a degree granting program unless the program requires special qualifications.        How do I transfer to another school as a Core Program student?    If you wish to attend a different school not offering direct transition, please consult with an academic adviser to discuss the internal transfer process and application as soon as possible. If you wish to apply for an off-track transfer, please refer to the admissions website since some schools have additional requirements . Information regarding transfer dates may be found here .\u00a0        Will my Core Program grades count after I transfer?    Yes. When you transition to CAS or any other school, your LS grades are calculated as part of the GPA for that school.         Registration and The Core Program Courses        How do I register for classes?    You may register for classes online, through ALBERT, the NYU students\u2019 information website. After you have your advisor\u2019s approval and have been cleared to register, you may register via Albert, accessed through the NYU Home web portal. Questions or concerns regarding ALBERT registration may be directed to albert@nyu.edu or registration@nyu.edu       Albert says that I need to be cleared by my adviser to register. What do I do?    You must meet with your assigned academic advisor to be cleared to register. Once receiving the faculty advisor\u2019s approval and clearance, you may register via Albert at the assigned registration day and time, accessed through the NYU Home web portal.      How do I decide which classes to take? What courses are Liberal Studies Core Program students expected to take?  The LS curriculum has been carefully designed as a building process in which both knowledge and skills are layered in logical sequence. Curriculum checklists may be accessed here .  A typical LS student\u2019s schedule is the following:                1st Year:      FALL     Writing I     Social Foundations I     Cultural Foundations I     Elective      SPRING     Writing II     Social Foundations II     Cultural Foundations II     Elective             2nd Year:        Social or Cultural Foundations III     Elective     Elective     Elective     Social or Cultural Foundations III     Elective     Elective     Elective           You are required to fulfill at least one math or science course prior to transitioning. \u00a0            What Natural Science courses are available for Core Program students?  As a Liberal Studies student, you may take the following Natural Science courses:            Natural Science I     History of the Universe (HOU-UF 101)     Science of Technology (SCTEC-UF 101)      Natural Science II     Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2)     Life Science (LISCI-UF 101)     Environmental Studies (ENSTU-UF 101)             What math course should I take?    Math courses should be determined by the major in which you wish to pursue. Therefore, it is suggested as a Liberal Studies student, you should fulfill your science courses prior to taking a math unless you have a clear direction in your major choice. Quantitative Reasoning (MAP-UA10-), Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) fulfills the math requirement for CAS or most NYU schools. You should consult the transitioning school to determine the school\u2019s math requirement. Please note that the Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9) course does not fulfill the math requirement for CAS, but might for other NYU schools. If you have an AP Calculus score of 4 or 5, you may also be exempt from Calculus I and/or Quantitative Reasoning, depedning on the school. Please contact an academic advisor to submit AP scores to the registrar's office. Students entering as of Fall 2012, who obtain a qualifying score on the Mathematics SAT-II subject test (Level I or Level II) may be exempt from the QR course requirement in MAP for CAS, but not for other schools. Please check with your advisor.      I\u2019m fluent in a language other than English. Do I still need to take the Foreign Language Placement test?    You are required to take the Foreign Language Placement exam to be exempt from the language requirement, unless you have an AP (or other advanced placement) credits in a language. Many study abroad locations require you to be enrolled in a language course while abroad. Please refer to the NYU Study Abroad website to determine the requirements for each site: http://www.nyu.edu/studyabroad/       What are my study abroad options?  You have an option to study at 13 NYU study away sites. Many study abroad locations require the student to be enrolled in a language course while abroad. Please refer to the NYU Study Abroad website to determine language requirements and available courses for each site. Coursework at the site should count towards the students\u2019 intended major and/or minor. You may wish to visit NYU\u2019s study abroad site at http://www.nyu.edu/studyabroad/ or contact Beth Haymaker , Director of Global Programs, for additional information.              I&rsquo;m pre-health. What courses do I need to take?  If you are in the pre-health program, you must take the same sequence of courses no matter what college you attend. The professional schools, not the undergraduate colleges, require these courses. In addition, pre-health is an intention, not a major, so pre-health students should wisely plan to use their elective space to fill major requirements.    All pre-health students\u2014at LS and otherwise\u2014are advised to take the following core pre-health courses and should speak to Jeff Walker-Sherson , the Core Program Pre-health Professonal Academic Advisor for course selection advisement:            * Calculus I     General Chemistry I and Lab     General Chemistry II and Lab     Principles of Biology I     Principles of Biology II     Organic Chemistry I and Lab     Organic Chemistry II and Lab     General Physics I     General Physics II      Biochemistry I           Suggested Classes for the new MCAT:           Intro to Psychology      Intro to Sociology           * Medical schools will accept AP credit for this requirement     MATH-UA 121     CHEM-UA125     CHEM-UA126     BIOL-UA 11     BIOL-UA 12     CHEM-UA 225     CHEM-UA 226     PHYS-UA 11     PHYS-UA 12      CHEM-UA 881                     PSYCH-UA 1     SOC-UA 1        4 credits     6 credits     6 credits     4 credits     4 credits     6 credits      6 credits      5 credits      5 credits      4 credits                     4 credits      4 credits                    The specific pre-health requirements outlined above must be completed before students matriculate into medical school. Since the MCAT is based on the assumption that students have completed these courses, the normal procedure is to have these completed before sitting for the examination.    NOTE: These courses are the minimum requirements . Some schools may require additional coursework, particularly in mathematics. Students should familiarize themselves with the specific requirements for those schools to which they plan on applying. The best source for this information is the AAMC publication &ldquo;Medical Schools Admissions Requirements.&rdquo;        The course I\u2019m interested in is filled. How does the waitlist work?    Some courses are set up with a waitlist that is offered when the course closes. If you choose to put your name on the waitlist, NYU policy states that: 1. the flat fee for full time students is based on enrollment for 12-18 points; and 2. there is an established maximum credit limit of no more than 18 points.        Waitlist instructions can be found here .             Can I take courses in other schools while in the Core Program?    Yes. You can take courses in other schools. Some courses require special approvals or codes from the sponsoring departments. Access or clearance codes must be obtained directly from the department or school offering the course.        Can I register for any 2 credit classes in the course schedule handbook?    You can register for up to 18 credits with no additional tuition in other schools. Some courses require special approvals or codes from the sponsoring departments. Access or clearance codes must be obtained directly from the department or school offering the course. Students who are interested should consult the University Directory of Classes for the semester in question.      Can Core Program students take summer and winter courses?    The Liberal Studies Core Program generally offers its own science summer courses; in addition LS Core Program students may take summer and winter courses through other NYU schools, most typically through CAS. Core Program students must receive clearance for summer courses from the LS Advising Center beforehand.          Majors and Minors        How do I declare my major?  As a Liberal Studies Core Program student, you will receive an e-mail from the Office of Admissions February of your sophomore year. Students who will be transitioning to CAS will be invited to visit their intended major department in CAS to declare their major in spring of sophomore year.        I\u2019m thinking about double majoring but it seems like doing two programs will be tight. What do I do?    This depends on the particular majors pursued (and other non-major elective credits earned). Since some majors entail only 9 courses, you can usually complete two majors within the standard 128 credits. There are majors, however, that require more than 9 courses. Students should consult with an academic adviser for more information on each prospective major.        Can I pursue a cross-school double major?    If you are bound for CAS, you may NOT pursue a secondary major in another school. If you are bound for other NYU schools, you may have the opportunity to pursue a secondary major at another NYU school. Please consult with an academic adviser or the NYU school for more information.        Can I pursue a cross-school minor?    Yes. You may pursue cross-school minors .              Resources            I\u2019m having trouble in one of my classes. Where can I get help?    The Academic Resource Center offers students help in math, science, computer science, economics, foreign languages through the University Learning Center as well as workshops in study skills, test taking strategies and time management.  Also, the NYU Writing Center offers tutoring in a range of writing needs, from planning and revising essays and research papers to preparing a resume or letters for employment. It is located at 411 Lafayette, 3rd floor.  Math tutoring is available through the CAS Math Department located in the Courant Institute, 251 Mercer Street.        What sort of awards and honor programs are available?  Students who demonstrate academic excellence are approached individually for the following awards and programs:   THE ELAINE KUNTZ MEMORIAL WRITING PRIZE  The Elaine Kuntz Memorial Writing Prize was established in 1988 in memory of Dr. Kuntz, who was the program\u2019s first associate director and a member of the faculty. The prize is awarded to an LS freshman each year for an outstanding essay produced in a writing course. The Writing faculty nominates students for this prize.   DEAN\u2019S HONORS LIST  At the end of each academic year, a Dean\u2019s Honors List is compiled. This is an honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.650 or higher for that academic year (September-May) in at least 28 graded points. In order to be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are not rounded off.   DEAN\u2019S CIRCLE  Students who complete the freshman year with a cumulative grade point average of 3.65 or better and who have earned at least 30 credit hours will be invited to apply for the Dean\u2019s Circle University Scholars program, LS\u2019s honor society. Dean\u2019s Circle scholars participate in a range of activities with faculty, including visits to cultural events (e.g., performances, museum exhibits, and concerts) and an international travel experience. Members are also expected to engage in community service and to work over the course of the year on a major research project on a topic related to Dean\u2019s Circle travel. In recent years, the Dean\u2019s Circle scholars have traveled to the Brazil, Czech Republic, Cuba, England, Germany, Spain and Turkey. Dean\u2019s Circle members in good standing also receive favorable consideration for the University Scholars program in the school to which they enroll in as juniors.     MICHAEL L. PROBST SCHOLARSHIPS    LS students are encouraged to apply for the Michael L. Probst Scholarships. The scholarship was endowed by a former distinguished NYU administrator. The awards are based solely on merit and are open to LS students at the end of the freshman year. Students do not need to be eligible for financial aid to receive the award. Scholarships will be applied to tuition charges for the fall semester of the sophomore year. The awards are for one year only and are not renewable. To be eligible to apply, students must have a cumulative NYU GPA of 3.75 or better with no outstanding incomplete grades, must have earned at least 32 credit hours toward the degree, must not have been subject to any disciplinary sanctions, and must enroll full time in for the fall semester. Eligible students must submit an application that includes an essay and a letter of support from an LS faculty member.   STEVE CURRY SCHOLARSHIPS    Curry awards, in honor of the program\u2019s former associate dean, provide students who study abroad and receive financial aid with funds for academic research travel during their international experience.         Internships and Job Searches        I would like to pursue an internship. Where can I find more information?  The basic guidelines under which sophomores in the Liberal Studies Core Program may receive credit for an internship can be found on the LS Advising Website.        I don\u2019t know what kind of job I want after graduation. How do I decide?    In addition to speaking with your faculty and academic advisor, information about careers and various professions may be further developed by visiting the Wasserman Center for Career Development .     Tuition and Financial Aid     Where can I find information regarding the cost of tuition and financial aid?   For a list of current tuition and fees, visit the Office of the Bursar . For financial aid information, you can visit the NYU Financial Aid website   .     If I register for more than 18 credits in one semester will I have to pay additional fees?   Yes. Your tuition fee covers a credit load of 12-18 credits. Anything over 18 credits is charged the per credit rate. Please click here for a list of current tuition and fees. Please note, it is your responsibility to contact the Financial Aid Office to find out how this increase may affect your financial aid. Also, this increase may impact your curricular planning and degree progress, therefore you should meet with an academic adviser.     If I decide to drop a class will I receive a refund?   You should refer to the University Tuition Refund Plan . It depends on how many credits you are enrolled in, how many credits you plan to drop and when you actually drop the credits. During the fall and spring semesters, you will pay full tuition as long as you are enrolled in 12-18 credits. If you start off with 18 credits and drop a 4 credit course, you will still be responsible for the full cost of tuition. If you decide to take a leave of absence and drop all of your classes, the following refund schedule will apply. If you are enrolled in 19 or more credits and drop down to 12-18 credits, the following refund schedule will apply to the per credit rate only (those credits above 18).                          \u00a9 New York University | Arts and Science | Liberal Studies"}]},

Applicants are admitted as freshmen and as transfer students. Candidates are  accepted on the basis of predicted success in the specific programs in which  they are interested. If the applicant meets formal course requirements, his or  her capacity for successful undergraduate work is measured through careful  consideration of secondary school and/or college records; recommendations from  guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and  the personal essay.          Each  applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for  intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special  offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered  objectively and evaluated for participation in extracurricular and community  services, in addition to scholarly pursuits.          New  York University actively seeks students who are varied in interests, talents,  and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention  is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportunities  available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been.  Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential  students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University  and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community  activities is an important factor.          Applicants  who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this  section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\"              RECOMMENDED  HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION      The  quality of an applicant's secondary school record is more important than a  prescribed pattern of courses. Freshmen who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English, with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four  years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three  to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language.  Students most competitive for admission will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and  IB courses the applicant has completed in high school. It is strongly  recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the  senior year of high school.              THE  ADMISSIONS PROCESS      All  candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application  and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application.  Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application  available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to  submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, New York  University, 665 Broadway, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10012-2339.          A  complete application will include:      The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions     Official high school transcripts and/or college records for courses for which  academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test  scores, if applicable).     The Common Application School Report (for freshman applicants) or Registrar  Report (for transfer applicants).     All required testing should be completed and official results forwarded  electronically by one testing agency to NYU.     The NYU code for SAT and TOEFL scores is 2562; the code for ACT scores is 2838.     At least one Teacher Evaluation.     Personal statement/essay.          Candidates  are urged to complete and file their applications as soon as possible,  especially those seeking financial aid and/or housing. (See below for application  filing deadlines.) No admissions decision will be made without complete  information. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions reserves the right to  substitute or waive particular admissions requirements at the discretion of the admissions committee.          Applications  submitted after the filing deadline are unlikely to be considered by the  committee, except under special circumstances.          Freshman  candidates may choose between Early Decision, Early Decision II, and Regular  Decision admission for September admission. Depending on the notification plan,  applicants will receive an admissions decision on December 15, February 15, or  April 1. Transfer candidates for summer and September admission are notified  beginning in early to mid-May. Transfer candidates for January admission are  notified on a rolling basis, usually beginning on or around November 15.

For  entrance in the summer sessions (transfer applicants only), applications should  be received by April 1.          Applications  for admission received after these dates are unlikely to be considered for  admission except under special circumstances. Please contact the Office of  Undergraduate Admissions or call 212-998-4500 for information regarding program  availability.              CAMPUS  VISITS      All prospective students and their parents are invited to  visit the New York University campus. Opportunities to tour the University, to  meet students and faculty, and to attend classes are available to interested  students.          Both  high school and college students wishing to discuss the choice of a college,  the transfer process, or academic programs are invited to attend an information  session conducted by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at the Jeffrey S.  Gould Welcome Center located at 50 West Fourth Street. The Office of  Undergraduate Admissions holds daily information sessions and conducts campus  tours, Monday through Friday and many Saturdays, except during University  holidays. Visit the undergraduate admissions website or call 212-998-4524 to  make an appointment for an information session and tour.          Although  interviews are not available, a visit to the campus is strongly recommended. It  is suggested that reservations be made well in advance of your visit.          For  information about booking accommodations for your visit to NYU, please be sure  to check the \"visit us\" section of the admissions website.              STANDARDIZED  TESTS      NYU  seeks talented students from every corner of the globe. Applicants are expected  to demonstrate their talents and mastery of subject matter to support their  applications and to marshal their best case for admission to NYU. As a result,  NYU has one of the most flexible testing policies of any college or university.          To  be eligible for admission, applicants are expected to submit results from one  of the following testing options:      The SAT Reasoning Test; or The ACT (with Writing Test); or     Three SAT Subject Test scores; or     Three AP exam scores; or     The International Baccalaureate Diploma; or     Three IB higher-level exam scores (if you are not an IB Diploma candidate); or     Students may instead elect to submit results from a nationally accredited exam  that is considered locally to signify the completion of secondary education and  is administered independently of the student's school.          Note: SAT Subject Test,  AP, or IB scores (for students not submitting an IB diploma) must be submitted  in the form of: one in literature or the humanities; one in math or science;  and one test of the student's choice in any subject.          The  following country-specific examinations are all accepted as admission  credentials; note, however, that only a few of them also carry advanced standing  credit (see details under \"credit by examination\" section, below):     Australia: Australian Capital Territory Year 12 Certificate, New South Wales Higher School Certificate (HSC), Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training (NTCET), Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE), South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE), Tasmanian Certificate of Education (TCE), Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE), or Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE); in addition to Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) or Overall Position (OP) positioning Bangladesh: Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) Exams Bhutan: Bhutan Higher Secondary Education Certificate Examination (BHSEC) Brazil: Certificado de Conclusao de Ensino Medio + Vestibular (University Entrance Exam) or Exame Nacional do Ensino M\u00e9dio/Middle Education National Examination (ENEM) Brunei: Brunei Matriculation Examination Bulgaria: Matura Caribbean: Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination Chile: Prueba De Seleccion Universitaria China: Chinese National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gao Kao) Colombia: Examen de Estado para Ingreso a la Educacion Superior (Saber 11) Costa Rica: Bachillera Nacional Cote D'Ivoire: Baccalaur\u00e9at Croatia: Matura Cyprus: \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2 \u0395\u03be\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 (Pancyprian Examinations) Czech Republic: Maturitn\u00ed zkou\u0161ka Denmark: Students may submit either of the following exams: Studentereksamen H\u00f8jere Forberedelseseksamen Estonia: Riigieksamitunnistus Ethiopia: Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination Europe: European Baccalaureate (EB) Finland: Ylioppilastutkintotodistus France: Baccalaur\u00e9at Germany: Abitur Greece: Apolytirion Hong Kong: Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE) Hungary: \u00c9rettsegi vizsga India: Indian School Certificate (ISC), All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) or Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC).

If you have a question as to whether  or not an examination offered in your country would meet our testing  requirements, please send an email to admissions.ops@nyu.edu and we will  confirm. You should not assume that any examinations will meet our testing  requirements unless they are listed above.         Submitting  Scores/   Examination Results          Test  scores or examination results should be submitted by the appropriate  application deadline. If final examination results are unavailable at the time  of application, predicted results may be sent (except in the case of SAT, SAT  Subject, ACT, or AP scores, which must be final when submitted). Predicted  results, which may be subject to additional verification, may only be submitted  by a school official, via one of the following methods:          Naviance/Common Application website;     Mailed on official school letterhead, in a sealed and signed envelope; or     E-mailed from a clearly identifiable school e-mail address.          If  predicted results are submitted in place of final results, NYU reserves the  right to withdraw an offer of admission if final results are not within close  range of the predicted results.          Students  are welcome to submit evidence of national or international academic  accomplishments that they feel may further support their application.          International  students applying to our campus in New York should also review NYU's English  language testing requirements at the Admissions website.          Official  test scores should be sent directly to NYU from the testing agencies. The NYU  code for the College Board (SAT Reasoning Test, SAT I, SAT II  Examinations/Subject Tests, and TOEFL) is 2562; the ACT code for NYU is 2838.

Some of the foreign language  examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core  exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same.      2 Scores in these  languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who  intend to register  for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.     3 Scores in these  languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper  level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or  the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver 908; 212-998-8110.      4 A score of 650 or  better on either mathematics subject examination (or on the mathematics section  of the SAT general test) places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or  Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these  courses.                  FINANCIAL  AID APPLICATION      After  the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid applications  are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered.          All  freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Application for  Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholarship Service/Financial Aid  PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our  NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated  with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be  made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must  include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the  FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted  by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for  financial aid need only complete the FAFSA.          New  York State residents should also complete the separate application for the  Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit www.nyu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/financial-aid . Students from  other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state  programs if their state grants can be used at New York University.              EARLY  DECISION FOR ENTERING FRESHMEN      NYU  offers two Early Decision application options for freshman applicants who are  certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early  Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th  (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II).          An  Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process      NYU's  Early Decision programs are, in fact, binding agreements, whereby if an  applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that  enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously  submitted applications and accept NYU's admission offer\u2014roughly within two to  three weeks of receiving an admission offer. Students are then restricted from  filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active  applications to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS  PROFILE online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon  after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have  roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid package before  confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on  January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after  submitting an enrollment deposit.          We  believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to  provide an early decision ; for that reason,  we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates.          Early  Decision and Financial Aid      NYU  uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision  candidates as we do in providing financial aid for Regular Decision candidates.  Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply  for admission.          For Early Decision I candidates, we use information  students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide  admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th.  For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted  students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students  are then provided with their official financial aid award in late April,  assuming students have completed their Free Application for Federal Student Aid  (FAFSA) by February 15th.          Students  will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their  estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must  be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial  aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will  be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision  program. NYU will still reserve the majority of our admission offers for  students applying for Regular Decision, so students should not feel pressure to  apply Early Decision if finances are of concern.          Early  Decision Application Process      Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the  Early Decision I or II option.         Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Application  website. Secure the signature of your parent or guardian and your college  adviser/guidance counselor. When you apply online, the Early Decision Agreement  may be submitted along with your high school transcript. Alternatively,  it may be faxed to 212-995-4911 by your counselor.         Submit all supporting materials, such as transcripts and standardized test  scores, to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions by the appropriate deadline.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS      A  student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in  September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will  be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better  within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls  within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a  vocational nature or courses not consistent with the educational objectives of  the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited  colleges are eligible for admission.          Except  when specifically noted, the general procedures described for entering freshmen  apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four-year  regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official  credentials from all institutions attended, including secondary school  transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high  school should submit their test results as part of their application. Transfer  applicants who did not take these exams while in high school and have been in  college less than one year must follow the testing requirements listed on the admissions website. All transfer applicants are encouraged to submit scores  from two SAT Subject Tests if previously taken while in high school.              TRANSFER  APPLICANTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY      Students  who wish to transfer from one school to another within the University must file  an Internal Transfer Application available online prior to the application  deadline (November 1 for the spring term and March 1 for the summer or fall  term).              THE  ENROLLMENT PROCESS      To  be enrolled, an admitted undergraduate candidate must do the following:          Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable  tuition deposit.         If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit.         Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the  Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center.         File a medical report.         Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic  advisement.         Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines.     Register for classes when notified.              SPECIAL  (VISITING) STUDENTS      Undergraduate  matriculated students who are currently attending other regionally accredited  four-year colleges and maintaining good standing, both academic and  disciplinary, may be admitted on certification from their own schools. Such  students must be eligible to receive degree credit at their own schools for  courses taken at the University. The approval as a special undergraduate student  is for two terms only and cannot be extended. The Special Student Application  Form for undergraduate students may be obtained online. A $70 application fee  is required. Deadlines for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      All  special students must meet the regulations of the Faculty Committee on  Undergraduate Academic Standards regarding grades and program.              APPLICANTS  WITH INTERNATIONAL CREDENTIALS      Applicants  to New York University who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents of  the United States must complete the Application for Admission to Undergraduate  Study available online. Please indicate on the application for admission your  country of citizenship, and if you are currently residing in the United States,  your current visa status.          Freshman  applicants (those who are currently attending or who have previously completed  secondary school only) seeking to begin studies in the fall (September)  semester must submit applications and all required credentials on or before the  application deadline that corresponds to their selected notification plan  (November 1 for Early Decision I, and January 1 for Early Decision II and  Regular Decision). Transfer applicants (those who are currently attending or who  have previously attended university or tertiary school) must submit  applications and all required credentials on or before April 1. Transfer  candidates seeking admission for the spring (January) semester must submit  their applications and credentials on or before November 1. Applications will  not be processed until the Office of Undergraduate Admissions receives all  supporting credentials.          All  freshman applicants are required to submit official test results. Please visit  the Admissions website to learn about the admissions requirements.          If  the applicant's secondary education culminated in a maturity certificate  examination, he or she is required to submit an official copy of the grades  received in each subject. All documents submitted for review must be official;  that is, they must be either originals or copies certified by authorized  persons. A \"certified\" photocopy or other copy is one that bears either an  original signature of the registrar or other designated school officials or an  original impression of the institution's seal. Uncertified photocopies are not  acceptable. If these official documents are in a foreign language, they must be  accompanied by an official English translation.          In  addition, every applicant whose native language is not English must take the  Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), the International English  Language Testing System (IELTS), or the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE  Academic). Information concerning these examinations may be obtained by  visiting the website. Each student must request that his or her score on this  examination be sent to the NYU Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center, code  2562.          Applicants  residing in the New York area may elect to take the English proficiency test of  the University's American Language Institute, located at 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003. An appointment to take the test may be made by  calling 212-998-7040.          Financial  documentation is not required when filing an application. If the student is  accepted, instructions for completing the Application for Certificate of  Eligibility (AFCOE) online will be included in the acceptance packet.  Appropriate evidence of financial ability must be submitted with the AFCOE to  the Office for International Students and Scholars in order for the appropriate  visa document to be issued. If the applicant's studies are being financed by  means of his or her own savings, parental support, outside private or  government scholarships, or any combination of these, he or she must arrange to  send official letters or similar certification as proof of such support.          New  students may wish to view the multimedia tutorial for new international  students.              THE  AMERICAN LANGUAGE INSTITUTE      The American Language Institute of the School of  Continuing and Professional Studies of New York University offers intensive  courses in English for students with little or no proficiency in the language.  It also offers the Advanced Workshop Program in English for students with  substantial English proficiency but insufficient proficiency for undertaking a  full-time academic program. Qualified students in this program can often  combine English study with a part-time academic program. This combination may  constitute a full-time program of study. The institute also offers specialized  courses in accent reduction, grammar, and American business English.          Individuals  who wish to obtain additional information about the American Language Institute  are invited to visit the office of the American Language Institute weekdays throughout  the year between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. (Fridays until 5 p.m.). They  may also visit the website; contact The American Language Institute, School of  Continuing and Professional Studies, New York University, 7 East 12th Street,  Suite 821, New York, NY 10003; telephone: 212-998-7040; fax: 212-995-4135; or  e-mail: ali@nyu.edu .              STUDENT  VISAS AND ORIENTATION      Matters  pertaining to student visas and new student orientation are administered by the  Office of Global Services (OGS), 561 La Guardia Place, 1st Floor; 212-998-4720.  In addition, the staff of this office endeavors to aid international students  in taking full advantage of various social, cultural, and recreational  opportunities offered by the University and the city. Specific information on  programs and events can be found at www.nyu.edu/oiss .              READMISSION  OF FORMER STUDENTS      Any  former student who has been out of attendance for more than two consecutive  terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmission.  Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission application  filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1  for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be  considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.      Students  who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at  New York University must complete the regular application for transfer  admission and submit an official transcript.              SPECIAL  (POSTGRADUATE) STUDENTS      Graduates  of accredited four-year colleges, including the College of Arts and Science and  other schools of New York University, may register as special students in  undergraduate courses for which they meet the prerequisites and that are still  open after matriculated students have registered. Such a student should submit  proof of his or her degree and an application for admission as a special  postgraduate student. The application form can be obtained online.          Deadlines  for applications are as follows:      Fall: August 1     Spring: December 1     Summer: April 1      Students  interested in the post-baccalaureate premedical program should contact the  Preprofessional Center, College of Arts and Science, New York University,  Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901, New York, NY 10003-6688;  212-998-8160.              NYU  SPRING IN NEW YORK      NYU  Spring in New York offers college students from other institutions an opportunity  to earn college credit and to experience academic life at New York University.  Spring in New York participants enroll in one of eight areas of study, in  courses with NYU students and taught by NYU faculty.          In  addition to classroom learning, NYU Spring in New York students have access to  the same opportunities and benefits as NYU students: library access, sports  center access, and program office events, including ticket discounts for  Broadway shows, concerts, and sporting events. They are also encouraged to  participate in planned excursions around the city.      The  program is offered to students currently matriculated and in good standing at  an accredited college or university (within the United States) with a  competitive grade point average. Students must have at least sophomore standing  in the academic year of participation.          Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/spring.in.ny .              NYU  JANUARY TERM      New  York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new  scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students  have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest.  During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the  foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as  have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of  year.          Oftentimes,  the fall and spring semesters can be overly hectic for students, considering a  full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship  commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new  academic interest or take advantage of the many  cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term  provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major,  minor, or elective) in courses that are in high demand, to accelerate degree  completion, and to concentrate on personal interests.         Further  information is available at www.nyu.edu/winter .              ADVANCED  STANDING      Credit  may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or  university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the  applicant's records are examined carefully to determine how much, if any,  advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere  is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the  content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere;  individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability  of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree  of preparation that completed courses provide for more advanced study here.  Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and  provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses  were completed within the past 10 years.          Quarter  hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits  transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at  face value to NYU.          As  with all other students, transfer students are required to fulfill the  residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following  residency requirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of  course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of  graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU.          A  tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student  upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of advanced  standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation.  Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester  during which the final statement of advanced standing is received. Thereafter,  a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written  permission of the Office of the Dean.              CREDIT  BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS)      The  Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the  International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign  maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive  credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in  college-level examinations or proficiency examinations related to the College's  degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College.          The  maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College  that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special  examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved)  shall not exceed a total of 32.          International  Baccalaureate (IB)      The  College recognizes, for advanced standing credit, higher-level examinations  passed with grades of 6 or 7. No credit is granted for standard-level  examinations. Official reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate  Admissions Processing Center for review. See the chart below concerning those  IB test scores for which credit is given.         Maturity  Certificate Examinations          The College will consider the results of certain foreign  maturity certificate examinations for advanced standing credit. They are:      A Levels and Cambridge Pre-U     Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at     German Abitur     Italian Maturit\u00e0 Federal Swiss Maturity Certificate (Matura)      CAS  does not award credit for any other maturity certificate examinations.          Official  reports must be submitted to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing  Center. These documents will be added to the student record, but advanced  standing credit for all examinations other than AP and IB will be awarded by  the College Advising Center, Silver 905; 212-998-8130.      See  the chart below for details on those A Level and Cambridge Pre-U test scores  for which credit is given. For the other maturity examinations, please note  that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results  earn 8 points each (except for the Italian Maturit\u00e0, which is 4 points).          Minimum  scores for receiving credit are:      A Levels: B     Cambridge Pre-U: M2     CAPE: II (out of VII)     French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better     German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams  (schr.), not for oral (mdl.)     Italian Maturit\u00e0: 7 (out of 10)     Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6)              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT PROGRAM      The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP)  Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accordance with New York  University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for  test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject examination. Students  receiving credit toward their degree may not take the corresponding  college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See  the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The  chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equivalencies  are granted.          For  additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergraduate  Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.              ADVANCED  PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM      Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign  language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College also accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower likewise award no credit and have no bearing on placement.

Students receive 4 points total for a  score of 5 on the AP Art History exam, even though the equivalent two-semester  course sequence (ARTH-UA 1, 2) bears a total of 8 points.      3 Prehealth  students should not use AP credits to place out of BIOL-UA 11, 12      4 Economics  majors cannot use AP credit in calculus to skip over any or all of the  Mathematics for Economics I, II, III sequence (MATH-UA 211, 212, 213). Also  note that students wishing to enroll in Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Calculus  III (MATH-UA 123) must meet one or more of the prerequisites detailed in the  Mathematics section of the Bulletin.      5 Students  receive 8 points total for a score of 4 or 5 on the AP Chemistry exam, even  though the equivalent two-semester course sequence (CHEM-UA 125, 126/CHEM-UA  127, 128) bears a total of 10 points. AP credit will not count toward the  majors in chemistry and biochemistry.      6 AP  credits in Chinese and Japanese satisfy the Core requirement in foreign  language but cannot be used for placement in the correct level of study.  Students who plan to register for Chinese or Japanese at NYU must take the CAS  placement exam. Also note that AP credits cannot be applied to the East Asian  studies major or minor.      7 Credit  received for the Environmental Science exam does not count toward the major or  minor in environmental studies.      8 Credit  received for the German Language exam does not reduce the number of courses  required for the German major.      9 Students  wishing to go on in Latin must consult the classics department for proper  placement.

This table lists some of the many IB language examinations offered. An IB  language denoted as \"B\" is one studied as a second language; one denoted as \"A\"  is one's native language, or a language in which one has near-native fluency.  \"B\" language exam credits are at the intermediate level for purposes of Core  exemption, whereas \"A\" language exam credits are post-intermediate. A student  who presents \"A\" language credits and intends to register for the language at  NYU must first take the CAS placement exam or consult with the department.      3 Students who intend to register  for this language at NYU must take the CAS placement examination; the IB  credits cannot be used for placement.      4 Satisfies Natural Science I and  II in the Core. Prehealth students should not use IB credits to place out of  BIOL-UA 11, 12.      5 Satisfies Natural Science I and  II in the Core. Students receive 8 points total even though the equivalent  two-semester course sequence in CAS bears a total of 10 points. IB credit does  not count toward the majors in chemistry and biochemistry. Prehealth students  should not use it to place out of CHEM-UA 125, 126/127, 128.      6 Students who intend to register  for Chinese at NYU must take the CAS placement examination; the IB credits  cannot be used for placement. Also note that IB credits cannot be applied to the  East Asian studies major or minor.      7 Students who intend to register  for ancient Greek at NYU must consult the classics department for proper  placement. IB credit in Classical Greek will not reduce the number of courses  required for a classics major or minor.      8 Students planning a major or  minor in computer science must consult with that department about proper  placement and possible counting of IB credits towards departmental  requirements.      9 IB credit can be counted towards  the major or minor in economics.      10 Students planning a major in  history must consult with that department about possible counting of some IB  credits towards the major. No IB credits may be used for the minor in history.      11 Students who intend to register  for Japanese at NYU must take the CAS placement examination; the IB credits  cannot be used for placement. Also note that IB credits cannot be applied to  the East Asian studies major or minor.      12 Students who intend to register  for Korean at NYU must take the CAS placement examination; the IB credits  cannot be used for placement. Also note that IB credits cannot be applied to  the East Asian studies major or minor.      13 Students who intend to register  for Latin at NYU must consult the classics department for proper placement. IB  credit in Latin will not reduce the number of courses required for a classics  major or minor.      14 Satisfies the Core Quantitative  Reasoning requirement. Students majoring in economics cannot use these credits  to skip over any of the following: Mathematics for Economics I, II, III  (MATH-UA 211, 212, 213). For IB results in Further Mathematics, students must  consult with the Department of Mathematics for exact course equivalencies.      15 Satisfies Natural Science I and  II in the Core. Students receive 8 points total even though the equivalent  two-semester course sequence in CAS bears a total of 10 points. Students  planning a major or minor in physics must consult with that department about  proper placement and possible counting of IB credits towards departmental  requirements. Prehealth students should not use IB credits to place out of  PHYS-UA 11, 12.      16 Majors and minors in psychology  can use four of the points to exempt from PSYCH-UA 1 and to count as one of the  ten courses required for the major or as one of the four courses required for  the minor. The other four points cannot be applied towards psychology major or  minor requirements.

Note that in Singapore, A Level  examinations must be designated as H2 or H3 to receive credit.      2 CAS also awards 8 credits for  many of the Cambridge Pre-U examinations in liberal arts and science subjects  that parallel the A Level offerings. The range of acceptable scores (lowest to  highest) is: M2, M1, D3, D2, D1.      3 Note on foreign languages: an A Level  score of B or higher, or a Pre-U score of M2 or higher, in any foreign language  satisfies the College Core Curriculum requirement.      4 Students who intend to register  for this language at NYU must take the CAS placement examination; the A  Level/Pre-U credits cannot be used for placement.      5 A score of B on History of Art does not count towards the major or minor in art history or exempt students from either ARTH-UA 1 or 2. A score of A exempts students from ARTH-UA 1 and 2, but the credits do not reduce the total number of courses required for the major or minor.     6 Satisfies Natural Science I and  II in the Core. Prehealth students should not use A Level/Pre-U credits to  place out of BIOL-UA 11, 12.      7 Satisfies Natural Science I and  II in the Core. Students receive 8 points total even though the equivalent  two-semester course sequence in CAS bears a total of 10 points. A Level/Pre-U  credit does not count toward the majors in chemistry and biochemistry.  Prehealth students should not use it to place out of CHEM-UA 125, 126/127, 128.      8 Students who intend to register  for Chinese at NYU must take the CAS placement examination; the A Level/Pre-U  credits cannot be used for placement. Also note that A Level/Pre-U credits  cannot be applied to the East Asian studies major or minor.      9 Students who intend to register  for ancient Greek at NYU must consult the classics department for proper  placement. A Level/Pre-U credits in Classical Greek will not reduce the number  of courses required for a classics major or minor.      10 Classical Studies is not a course  in classical languages. Students interested in any majors or minors offered by  the CAS Department of Classics must consult with the director of undergraduate  studies about possible counting of A Level/Pre-U credits towards departmental  requirements.      11 Students planning a major or  minor in computer science must consult with that department about proper  placement and possible counting of A Level/Pre-U credits towards departmental  requirements.      12 A Level/Pre-U credits can be  counted towards the major or minor in economics.      13 A Level/Pre-U credits do not  apply to the politics major or minor or allow students to place out of  introductory courses in that department.      14 Students planning a major in  history must consult with that department about possible counting of some A  Level/Pre-U credits towards the major. No A Level/Pre-U credits may be used for  the minor in history.      15 Students who intend to register  for Latin must consult the classics department for proper placement. A  Level/Pre-U credits in Latin will not reduce the number of courses required for  a classics major or minor.      16 Satisfies Quantitative Reasoning  in the Core. Students majoring in economics cannot use A Level/Pre-U credits to  skip over some or all of the following: Mathematics for Economics I, II, III  (MATH-UA 211, 212, 213). For A Level/Pre-U results in Further or Pure  Mathematics, students must consult with the Department of Mathematics for exact  course equivalencies.      17 Satisfies Natural Science I and  II in the Core. Students receive 8 points total even though the equivalent  two-semester course sequence in CAS bears a total of 10 points. Students  planning a major or minor in physics must consult with that department about  proper placement and possible counting of A Level/Pre-U credits towards  departmental requirements. Prehealth students should not use A Level/Pre-U  credits to place out of PHYS-UA 11, 12.      18 Majors and minors in psychology  can use four of the A Level/Pre-U credits to exempt from PSYCH-UA 1 and to  count as one of the ten courses required for the major or as one of the four  courses required for the minor. The other four points cannot be applied towards  psychology major or minor requirements.      19 A Level/Pre-U credits cannot be  counted towards the religious studies major or minor.      20 Sociology majors may request  departmental approval for counting four of the eight A Level/Pre-U credits  toward the major as one of the three required SOC-UA electives. However, the  credits never exempt students from any of the introductory courses in Sociology  (SOC-UA 1, 2, 3).

Such decisions are made on a case-by-case basis by the NYU school or college after a student is admitted. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will not evaluate courses for possible transfer credit before a student is admitted to NYU. Freshmen are generally awarded a maximum of 32 credits upon arrival at NYU and transfer students are generally awarded a maximum of 64 credits upon arrival at NYU. Transfer students must typically take a minimum of 64 credits at NYU to obtain a bachelor's degree from NYU.          AP Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for scores of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement (AP) examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the College Board to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions (NYU's code is 2562).     IB Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing is typically awarded for grades of 6 or 7 on the International Baccalaureate (IB) higher level examinations taken before graduation. No credit will be awarded for tests taken after the completion of high school. In order to receive credit, you must have official score results sent directly from the International Baccalaureate Organization to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.     College/University Course Credit   Credits Earned While In High School   Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school, provided they received a grade of &quot;B&quot; or better in the courses and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. Generally, these courses should be taken on a college/university campus, with other college/university students, and taught by a college/university faculty member.     NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements.   Credits Earned After High School   Students may be eligible for transfer credit in courses taken for credit at an accredited college within the last ten years, provided the student earned a minimum grade of &quot;C.&quot; Upon receiving an offer of admission, students will receive a detailed evaluation of transfer credit. All courses specific to a student\u2019s intended major will be reviewed by the appropriate academic department. We are not able to evaluate coursework for transfer credit until an admissions decision is made.   Credit is not awarded for Pass/Fail grades and some schools and colleges at NYU have rigorous standards for credit. For example, some schools and colleges at NYU will only grant credit for courses taken on a college/university campus with other college/university students and taught by a college/university faculty member. The Stern School of Business will not award credit to freshmen for any economics, statistics, or business course taken anywhere but at Stern. In general, Stern freshmen should also not expect to receive any credits for math courses; in some cases, a student may be eligible to receive credit for calculus-level courses \u2013 but only after first completing a calculus course here at NYU.   Academic course credit will typically not be awarded for life experiences (e.g. work, internships, military service, etc.). Credit for courses taken online will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by each department/school/college after admission and upon arrival at NYU, provided that the course was completed at an accredited college or university.     For transfer students, the Office of Undergraduate Admissions will provide a preliminary statement of transfer credit (accessible online) at the time of admission, to give admitted students a general sense of credit allocation a student can expect to receive upon enrollment at NYU. Preliminary transfer credit evaluations will not be provided prior to admission. Decisions on the awarding of actual credit will ultimately be made by each department/school/college at NYU.     NYU Abu Dhabi does not offer credit for any examinations or previous coursework. NYU Shanghai has yet to define its credit allocation policies.                                Country-Specific Examination Credit   Credit and/or advanced standing may be awarded for country-specific examinations according to the following standards:                                                          Commonwealth Caribbean Region                               Exam: CXC Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE)     Minimum Score: II     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      France                               Exam: Baccalaur\u00e9at   Minimum Score: 12     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Germany                               Exam: Abitur     Minimum Score: 10     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Italy                               Exam: Esame di Stato (Maturit\u00e1)     Minimum Score: 7     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 4 credits/points                                                                      United Kingdom                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points       Exam: Cambridge Pre-U     Minimum Score: M2     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Singapore                               Exam: A-Level     Minimum Score: B     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                      Switzerland                               Exam: Matura     Minimum Score: 4.5     Points Awarded per Subject Area Exam: 8 credits/points                                                                    NYU Footer          Search      Directory      Campus Map      Events      Contact Us      Site Map      Copyright and Fair Use      Feedback         Unless otherwise noted, all content copyright New York University.

How do I get one?   For instructions on obtaining transcripts, please find the information here . NYU does not accept transcript requests via email.      How do I calculate my GPA?    You can calculate your Grade Point Average (GPA) by determining the total of all    grade points earned and dividing that figure by the total number of credits    completed. For example, a student who has completed one 4-credit course with    a grade of A, one 4-credit course with a grade of B+, and one 2-credit course with    a grade of B has a grade point average of 3.52. This was computed as follows:        Credits\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Point Value            4 credits x 4.0 (A)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 16.0    4 credits x 3.3 (B+)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 13.2    2 credits x 3.0 (B)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.0\u00a0    10 credits\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a035.2        Now, divide the total point value (35.2) by the number of credits earned (10).    The total is your GPA (3.52).        Grades for work done at other institutions including those earned while matriculating    in other institutions are not included in a student\u2019s grade point average.    There are no A+, D-, or F+ grades.          How do I bring in my AP, A-Level, IB, or previously completed college credits?    The Advanced Placement Program (AP), the International Baccalaureate Program, and results of some foreign maturity certificate examinations may enable you to receive credit. Please meet with an adviser to assess your scores for which credit may be given. If you are seeking to apply credit for previous college work, you must submit an official transcript and a syllabus or course description. Credits will be applicable only if the content of the course is similar to an equivalent NYU course. More information regarding credits may be found here .            How do I take a course Pass/Fail?    As a Liberal Studies Core Program student, you may elect one pass/fail option each semester, including the summer session. A total of 16 points may be taken pass/fail while in the Liberal Studies Program. The pass/fail option is not available for courses completed at non-NYU institutions.    The pass/fail option is unavailable for: 1. Courses in the LS Core Program Curriculum (Writing I &amp; II, Cultural Foundations I, II &amp; II, Social Foundations I, II &amp; III); 2. Required coursework towards a major and/or minor; and 3. Courses under the Morse Academic Plan requirements for CAS or core requirements for other NYU schools. To take a course pass/fail, you must submit a Pass/Fail Option form to the Liberal Studies Advising Center by the end of the fifth week of classes during the fall and spring terms, and by the end of the second week of classes for the summer sessions. Please meet with an academic advisor to submit the form.      How do I take an incomplete in a course?   If you encounter a serious problem based on unpredictable circumstances, it is at the discretion of the instructor whether or not to grant an incomplete at the end of a semester. Incompletes may only be awarded through prior written agreement (e.g. an Incomplete Contract) between the student and the professor before the end of the course.      How do I withdraw from a course? What is the significance of receiving a &ldquo;W&rdquo; for a dropped class?    To withdraw from a course, you must submit a Withdrawal form to the Liberal Studies Advising Center by the end of the tenth week of classes during the fall and spring terms. The Assistant Director of Students must review and approve your request to withdraw. Once approved, a &ldquo;W&rdquo; will be recorded on your transcript and will not be included in the calculation of your grade point average. Specific deadline dates for this semester may be found here .    The significance of a &ldquo;W&rdquo; can vary depending on your particular circumstances. If you have a single &ldquo;W&rdquo; on your transcript, and you have a legitimate and justifiable reason for having withdrawn from a class, then a &ldquo;W&rdquo; should not be a serious cause for concern. However, if you have &ldquo;W&rsquo;s&rdquo; in multiple courses or consecutive semesters, or if you have withdrawn from a particular class multiple times, this may be interpreted as a cause for concern by someone reviewing your transcript.      What happens if I fail a course?   If you fail a core course required by the Liberal Studies Core Program (Writing I &amp; II, Cultural Foundations I, II &amp; II, Social Foundations I, II &amp; III), you must retake the course and receive a passing grade to be allowed to transfer to a degree program.   Failing non-required courses impacts your grade point averages such that you may need to retake them to satisfy transfer or major requirements.      What is a passing grade? Can I repeat a course?    A &ldquo;D&rdquo; is considered a passing grade. In some cases, you may need to repeat a course for a higher grade. Though both grades will still appear on your transcript, the grade you earn for the repeated course will be factored into your grade point average; the first grade is no longer calculated in the grade point average.        How do I take a leave of absence from the NYU?    If you need to take a semester off due various circumstances, please obtain an official leave of absence from the Assistant Director of Students, Leah Guarino-Ramirez, before the beginning of the semester.

Students entering in the Fall Semester of 2011 and later must maintain good academic standing (2.0) to transfer to a degree granting program unless the program requires special qualifications.        How do I transfer to another school as a Core Program student?    If you wish to attend a different school not offering direct transition, please consult with an academic adviser to discuss the internal transfer process and application as soon as possible. If you wish to apply for an off-track transfer, please refer to the admissions website since some schools have additional requirements . Information regarding transfer dates may be found here .\u00a0        Will my Core Program grades count after I transfer?    Yes. When you transition to CAS or any other school, your LS grades are calculated as part of the GPA for that school.         Registration and The Core Program Courses        How do I register for classes?    You may register for classes online, through ALBERT, the NYU students\u2019 information website. After you have your advisor\u2019s approval and have been cleared to register, you may register via Albert, accessed through the NYU Home web portal. Questions or concerns regarding ALBERT registration may be directed to albert@nyu.edu or registration@nyu.edu       Albert says that I need to be cleared by my adviser to register. What do I do?    You must meet with your assigned academic advisor to be cleared to register. Once receiving the faculty advisor\u2019s approval and clearance, you may register via Albert at the assigned registration day and time, accessed through the NYU Home web portal.      How do I decide which classes to take? What courses are Liberal Studies Core Program students expected to take?  The LS curriculum has been carefully designed as a building process in which both knowledge and skills are layered in logical sequence. Curriculum checklists may be accessed here .  A typical LS student\u2019s schedule is the following:                1st Year:      FALL     Writing I     Social Foundations I     Cultural Foundations I     Elective      SPRING     Writing II     Social Foundations II     Cultural Foundations II     Elective             2nd Year:        Social or Cultural Foundations III     Elective     Elective     Elective     Social or Cultural Foundations III     Elective     Elective     Elective           You are required to fulfill at least one math or science course prior to transitioning. \u00a0            What Natural Science courses are available for Core Program students?  As a Liberal Studies student, you may take the following Natural Science courses:            Natural Science I     History of the Universe (HOU-UF 101)     Science of Technology (SCTEC-UF 101)      Natural Science II     Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2)     Life Science (LISCI-UF 101)     Environmental Studies (ENSTU-UF 101)             What math course should I take?    Math courses should be determined by the major in which you wish to pursue. Therefore, it is suggested as a Liberal Studies student, you should fulfill your science courses prior to taking a math unless you have a clear direction in your major choice. Quantitative Reasoning (MAP-UA10-), Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) fulfills the math requirement for CAS or most NYU schools. You should consult the transitioning school to determine the school\u2019s math requirement. Please note that the Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9) course does not fulfill the math requirement for CAS, but might for other NYU schools. If you have an AP Calculus score of 4 or 5, you may also be exempt from Calculus I and/or Quantitative Reasoning, depedning on the school. Please contact an academic advisor to submit AP scores to the registrar's office. Students entering as of Fall 2012, who obtain a qualifying score on the Mathematics SAT-II subject test (Level I or Level II) may be exempt from the QR course requirement in MAP for CAS, but not for other schools. Please check with your advisor.      I\u2019m fluent in a language other than English. Do I still need to take the Foreign Language Placement test?    You are required to take the Foreign Language Placement exam to be exempt from the language requirement, unless you have an AP (or other advanced placement) credits in a language. Many study abroad locations require you to be enrolled in a language course while abroad. Please refer to the NYU Study Abroad website to determine the requirements for each site: http://www.nyu.edu/studyabroad/       What are my study abroad options?  You have an option to study at 13 NYU study away sites. Many study abroad locations require the student to be enrolled in a language course while abroad. Please refer to the NYU Study Abroad website to determine language requirements and available courses for each site. Coursework at the site should count towards the students\u2019 intended major and/or minor. You may wish to visit NYU\u2019s study abroad site at http://www.nyu.edu/studyabroad/ or contact Beth Haymaker , Director of Global Programs, for additional information.              I&rsquo;m pre-health. What courses do I need to take?  If you are in the pre-health program, you must take the same sequence of courses no matter what college you attend. The professional schools, not the undergraduate colleges, require these courses. In addition, pre-health is an intention, not a major, so pre-health students should wisely plan to use their elective space to fill major requirements.    All pre-health students\u2014at LS and otherwise\u2014are advised to take the following core pre-health courses and should speak to Jeff Walker-Sherson , the Core Program Pre-health Professonal Academic Advisor for course selection advisement:            * Calculus I     General Chemistry I and Lab     General Chemistry II and Lab     Principles of Biology I     Principles of Biology II     Organic Chemistry I and Lab     Organic Chemistry II and Lab     General Physics I     General Physics II      Biochemistry I           Suggested Classes for the new MCAT:           Intro to Psychology      Intro to Sociology           * Medical schools will accept AP credit for this requirement     MATH-UA 121     CHEM-UA125     CHEM-UA126     BIOL-UA 11     BIOL-UA 12     CHEM-UA 225     CHEM-UA 226     PHYS-UA 11     PHYS-UA 12      CHEM-UA 881                     PSYCH-UA 1     SOC-UA 1        4 credits     6 credits     6 credits     4 credits     4 credits     6 credits      6 credits      5 credits      5 credits      4 credits                     4 credits      4 credits                    The specific pre-health requirements outlined above must be completed before students matriculate into medical school. Since the MCAT is based on the assumption that students have completed these courses, the normal procedure is to have these completed before sitting for the examination.    NOTE: These courses are the minimum requirements . Some schools may require additional coursework, particularly in mathematics. Students should familiarize themselves with the specific requirements for those schools to which they plan on applying. The best source for this information is the AAMC publication &ldquo;Medical Schools Admissions Requirements.&rdquo;        The course I\u2019m interested in is filled. How does the waitlist work?    Some courses are set up with a waitlist that is offered when the course closes. If you choose to put your name on the waitlist, NYU policy states that: 1. the flat fee for full time students is based on enrollment for 12-18 points; and 2. there is an established maximum credit limit of no more than 18 points.        Waitlist instructions can be found here .             Can I take courses in other schools while in the Core Program?    Yes. You can take courses in other schools. Some courses require special approvals or codes from the sponsoring departments. Access or clearance codes must be obtained directly from the department or school offering the course.        Can I register for any 2 credit classes in the course schedule handbook?    You can register for up to 18 credits with no additional tuition in other schools. Some courses require special approvals or codes from the sponsoring departments. Access or clearance codes must be obtained directly from the department or school offering the course. Students who are interested should consult the University Directory of Classes for the semester in question.      Can Core Program students take summer and winter courses?    The Liberal Studies Core Program generally offers its own science summer courses; in addition LS Core Program students may take summer and winter courses through other NYU schools, most typically through CAS. Core Program students must receive clearance for summer courses from the LS Advising Center beforehand.          Majors and Minors        How do I declare my major?  As a Liberal Studies Core Program student, you will receive an e-mail from the Office of Admissions February of your sophomore year. Students who will be transitioning to CAS will be invited to visit their intended major department in CAS to declare their major in spring of sophomore year.        I\u2019m thinking about double majoring but it seems like doing two programs will be tight. What do I do?    This depends on the particular majors pursued (and other non-major elective credits earned). Since some majors entail only 9 courses, you can usually complete two majors within the standard 128 credits. There are majors, however, that require more than 9 courses. Students should consult with an academic adviser for more information on each prospective major.        Can I pursue a cross-school double major?    If you are bound for CAS, you may NOT pursue a secondary major in another school. If you are bound for other NYU schools, you may have the opportunity to pursue a secondary major at another NYU school. Please consult with an academic adviser or the NYU school for more information.        Can I pursue a cross-school minor?    Yes. You may pursue cross-school minors .              Resources            I\u2019m having trouble in one of my classes. Where can I get help?    The Academic Resource Center offers students help in math, science, computer science, economics, foreign languages through the University Learning Center as well as workshops in study skills, test taking strategies and time management.  Also, the NYU Writing Center offers tutoring in a range of writing needs, from planning and revising essays and research papers to preparing a resume or letters for employment. It is located at 411 Lafayette, 3rd floor.  Math tutoring is available through the CAS Math Department located in the Courant Institute, 251 Mercer Street.        What sort of awards and honor programs are available?  Students who demonstrate academic excellence are approached individually for the following awards and programs:   THE ELAINE KUNTZ MEMORIAL WRITING PRIZE  The Elaine Kuntz Memorial Writing Prize was established in 1988 in memory of Dr. Kuntz, who was the program\u2019s first associate director and a member of the faculty. The prize is awarded to an LS freshman each year for an outstanding essay produced in a writing course. The Writing faculty nominates students for this prize.   DEAN\u2019S HONORS LIST  At the end of each academic year, a Dean\u2019s Honors List is compiled. This is an honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.650 or higher for that academic year (September-May) in at least 28 graded points. In order to be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are not rounded off.   DEAN\u2019S CIRCLE  Students who complete the freshman year with a cumulative grade point average of 3.65 or better and who have earned at least 30 credit hours will be invited to apply for the Dean\u2019s Circle University Scholars program, LS\u2019s honor society. Dean\u2019s Circle scholars participate in a range of activities with faculty, including visits to cultural events (e.g., performances, museum exhibits, and concerts) and an international travel experience. Members are also expected to engage in community service and to work over the course of the year on a major research project on a topic related to Dean\u2019s Circle travel. In recent years, the Dean\u2019s Circle scholars have traveled to the Brazil, Czech Republic, Cuba, England, Germany, Spain and Turkey. Dean\u2019s Circle members in good standing also receive favorable consideration for the University Scholars program in the school to which they enroll in as juniors.     MICHAEL L. PROBST SCHOLARSHIPS    LS students are encouraged to apply for the Michael L. Probst Scholarships. The scholarship was endowed by a former distinguished NYU administrator. The awards are based solely on merit and are open to LS students at the end of the freshman year. Students do not need to be eligible for financial aid to receive the award. Scholarships will be applied to tuition charges for the fall semester of the sophomore year. The awards are for one year only and are not renewable. To be eligible to apply, students must have a cumulative NYU GPA of 3.75 or better with no outstanding incomplete grades, must have earned at least 32 credit hours toward the degree, must not have been subject to any disciplinary sanctions, and must enroll full time in for the fall semester. Eligible students must submit an application that includes an essay and a letter of support from an LS faculty member.   STEVE CURRY SCHOLARSHIPS    Curry awards, in honor of the program\u2019s former associate dean, provide students who study abroad and receive financial aid with funds for academic research travel during their international experience.         Internships and Job Searches        I would like to pursue an internship. Where can I find more information?  The basic guidelines under which sophomores in the Liberal Studies Core Program may receive credit for an internship can be found on the LS Advising Website.        I don\u2019t know what kind of job I want after graduation. How do I decide?    In addition to speaking with your faculty and academic advisor, information about careers and various professions may be further developed by visiting the Wasserman Center for Career Development .     Tuition and Financial Aid     Where can I find information regarding the cost of tuition and financial aid?   For a list of current tuition and fees, visit the Office of the Bursar . For financial aid information, you can visit the NYU Financial Aid website   .     If I register for more than 18 credits in one semester will I have to pay additional fees?   Yes. Your tuition fee covers a credit load of 12-18 credits. Anything over 18 credits is charged the per credit rate. Please click here for a list of current tuition and fees. Please note, it is your responsibility to contact the Financial Aid Office to find out how this increase may affect your financial aid. Also, this increase may impact your curricular planning and degree progress, therefore you should meet with an academic adviser.     If I decide to drop a class will I receive a refund?   You should refer to the University Tuition Refund Plan . It depends on how many credits you are enrolled in, how many credits you plan to drop and when you actually drop the credits. During the fall and spring semesters, you will pay full tuition as long as you are enrolled in 12-18 credits. If you start off with 18 credits and drop a 4 credit course, you will still be responsible for the full cost of tuition. If you decide to take a leave of absence and drop all of your classes, the following refund schedule will apply. If you are enrolled in 19 or more credits and drop down to 12-18 credits, the following refund schedule will apply to the per credit rate only (those credits above 18).                          \u00a9 New York University | Arts and Science | Liberal Studies"}]}]
