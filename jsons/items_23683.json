Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Beyond the basics of negotiation lie areas of greater complexity. One such area is the realm of culture. The role of culture can be considered from several perspectives: Cross-cultural (attempting, from one cultural perspective, to understand or describe another); intercultural (the interplay of cultures); and transcultural (aspects of negotiation that are common to all cultures or, in intercultural situations, transcend them.      Culture can be thought of in terms of both the relatively simple, though not unimportant, aspect of etiquette and behavior, and the more complex and profound aspect of consciousness and worldview. In the first half of the course, we will consider:   \u2022 The challenges of doing cultural analysis;   \u2022 A framework of cultural variables that comprise or underlie negotiation styles;   \u2022 Empirical studies about the differences that culture appears to make in the negotiation process;   \u2022 Cultural challenges in management; and   \u2022 The implications of these insights for reflective practitioners.      The second focus of the course is on the theory and practice of inter-group conflict resolution, which often has an important intercultural component, and the role of NGOs in that work. NGOs often can play an important role in peacemaking processes, though there can be tensions between NGOs and countries that are trying to resolve the conflict at the official diplomatic level. This section of the course will include a consideration of the many challenges of using inter-group processes to reduce tension and the possibility that well-intentioned western intervenors may inadvertently bring counterproductive cultural assumptions to such interventions.      The final session will be devoted primarily to playing and discussing a simulation involving an interethnic crossborder   conflict.

During its first year, the group organized several small panel discussions as well as larger events with noted guest speakers, including Zachary Metz, the director of Peace Building at Consensus, and Aldo Civico, the director of Columbia University's Center for International Conflict Resolution. This year, PACT hopes to provide students with the opportunity to discuss issues relating to international conflict and peacemaking and to connect with practitioners from the field.

The journal was created in 2006 and published its first edition on &quot;Development Issues&quot; the same year. PGI aims to encourage dialogue and analysis of issues that are critically relevant in the global arena by creating a forum for discussion and debate on a wide range of subjects that affect the community. These include but are not limited to issues of international law, human rights, development, globalization, public health, international finance and trade, security, and the environment.

THRILL is unique in that it focuses on issues and topics that put the needs of the human being first- not the needs of the state, the shareholder, the donor or the recipient, an industry, or even the international community as a whole. As a growing concentration, it should follow suit that human rights and international law students have adequate representation in academia, student affairs, SCPS events and external networks. THRILL exists to help bridge this gap in three particular ways:     Host events and discussions that fit our academic and career interests and goals;     Hold student discussion groups to debate and discuss issues relevant to the field of     international law and human rights;     Advocate for events and initiatives related to human rights and international law within the MSGA program as a whole.         THRILL is open to any student interested in the topic areas.

During its first year, the group organized several small panel discussions as well as larger events with noted guest speakers, including Zachary Metz, the director of Peace Building at Consensus, and Aldo Civico, the director of Columbia University's Center for International Conflict Resolution. This year, PACT hopes to provide students with the opportunity to discuss issues relating to international conflict and peacemaking and to connect with practitioners from the field.

The journal was created in 2006 and published its first edition on &quot;Development Issues&quot; the same year. PGI aims to encourage dialogue and analysis of issues that are critically relevant in the global arena by creating a forum for discussion and debate on a wide range of subjects that affect the community. These include but are not limited to issues of international law, human rights, development, globalization, public health, international finance and trade, security, and the environment.

THRILL is unique in that it focuses on issues and topics that put the needs of the human being first- not the needs of the state, the shareholder, the donor or the recipient, an industry, or even the international community as a whole. As a growing concentration, it should follow suit that human rights and international law students have adequate representation in academia, student affairs, SCPS events and external networks. THRILL exists to help bridge this gap in three particular ways:     Host events and discussions that fit our academic and career interests and goals;     Hold student discussion groups to debate and discuss issues relevant to the field of     international law and human rights;     Advocate for events and initiatives related to human rights and international law within the MSGA program as a whole.         THRILL is open to any student interested in the topic areas.

Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Beyond the basics of negotiation lie areas of greater complexity. One such area is the realm of culture. The role of culture can be considered from several perspectives: Cross-cultural (attempting, from one cultural perspective, to understand or describe another); intercultural (the interplay of cultures); and transcultural (aspects of negotiation that are common to all cultures or, in intercultural situations, transcend them.      Culture can be thought of in terms of both the relatively simple, though not unimportant, aspect of etiquette and behavior, and the more complex and profound aspect of consciousness and worldview. In the first half of the course, we will consider:   \u2022 The challenges of doing cultural analysis;   \u2022 A framework of cultural variables that comprise or underlie negotiation styles;   \u2022 Empirical studies about the differences that culture appears to make in the negotiation process;   \u2022 Cultural challenges in management; and   \u2022 The implications of these insights for reflective practitioners.      The second focus of the course is on the theory and practice of inter-group conflict resolution, which often has an important intercultural component, and the role of NGOs in that work. NGOs often can play an important role in peacemaking processes, though there can be tensions between NGOs and countries that are trying to resolve the conflict at the official diplomatic level. This section of the course will include a consideration of the many challenges of using inter-group processes to reduce tension and the possibility that well-intentioned western intervenors may inadvertently bring counterproductive cultural assumptions to such interventions.      The final session will be devoted primarily to playing and discussing a simulation involving an interethnic crossborder   conflict.

Semester: Spring       Courses         Description |    Syllabi |    Evaluations           Beyond the basics of negotiation lie areas of greater complexity. One such area is the realm of culture. The role of culture can be considered from several perspectives: Cross-cultural (attempting, from one cultural perspective, to understand or describe another); intercultural (the interplay of cultures); and transcultural (aspects of negotiation that are common to all cultures or, in intercultural situations, transcend them.      Culture can be thought of in terms of both the relatively simple, though not unimportant, aspect of etiquette and behavior, and the more complex and profound aspect of consciousness and worldview. In the first half of the course, we will consider:   \u2022 The challenges of doing cultural analysis;   \u2022 A framework of cultural variables that comprise or underlie negotiation styles;   \u2022 Empirical studies about the differences that culture appears to make in the negotiation process;   \u2022 Cultural challenges in management; and   \u2022 The implications of these insights for reflective practitioners.      The second focus of the course is on the theory and practice of inter-group conflict resolution, which often has an important intercultural component, and the role of NGOs in that work. NGOs often can play an important role in peacemaking processes, though there can be tensions between NGOs and countries that are trying to resolve the conflict at the official diplomatic level. This section of the course will include a consideration of the many challenges of using inter-group processes to reduce tension and the possibility that well-intentioned western intervenors may inadvertently bring counterproductive cultural assumptions to such interventions.      The final session will be devoted primarily to playing and discussing a simulation involving an interethnic crossborder   conflict.
