Art, Education, and Community Practice    Welcome to our new, socially oriented Art + Education program at NYU. Fall 2014 will be the first year of this innovative master's program that explores the intersections between contemporary artistic practice, educational theory, and social activism. We are looking for students who are interested in envisioning new ways that artists, educators, designers, community organizers, and social activists can work together, and within community-based settings to propose critical interventions that inspire dialogue and catalyze social change through the arts. Investigate:       What is artistic activism?    How is artistic activism similar to and different from social practice or socially engaged art?    What are the aesthetics and ethics of artistic activism?    How do we know when artistic activism is most effective, toward what ends?       Explore:       Greenwich Village and New York City, the cultural capital of the world, including world renown museums such as The New Museum, MoMA, and the Whitney Museum, along with nearby galleries in the Lower East Side and Chelsea    A comprehensive curriculum in contemporary visual art, educational theory, and social activism that combines theory with practice    A flexible program of study that can be tailored to your interests       Collaborate:       Work with practicing artists and educators in community-based and neighborhood settings around New York City    An internationally renowned and dedicated faculty from across New York University schools and programs    A richly diverse and multicultural community committed to social justice       Connect to Communities Grounded in the work of critical educational theorists including Paolo Freire and bell hooks, this program supports artists and other publicly situated activists to connect visual strategies with the needs of a community. Students learn from artists who do socially engaged work, examining how art and design can open dialogue about a community&rsquo;s history, culture, and social needs. Drawing on community organizing strategies and artistic activism, students are directly involved in putting ideas generated with the community into practice. This hands-on approach leads to a capstone project, which provides an opportunity to design and implement a community-based art project that allows for social transformation. In this program students assume major roles in changing the social, cultural, political, and economic landscape through their artistic practice. This interdisciplinary program prepares students to work within community-based settings, museums, NGOs, or broader public and civic contexts to initiate social change through the arts.    This program does not lead to certification for teaching. One-Year Program with Small Classes Classes are small and personal attention is given to each student throughout the duration of program, from initial advisement through completion of the master's final project.    The program can be completed in as little as 3 semesters or 12 months, as a full-time student. The program can also be completed as a part-time student in two years.    Enrollment    The Art, Education, and Community Practice program serves individuals interested in socially engaged art who want to work outside of or in collaboration with traditional venues (museum, gallery arena, and classrooms). Students come from a wide variety of backgrounds including studio art and design, community-based organizations, social activism, and a variety of education contexts. Graduates may also serve as artists and organizers working as educators, curators, and artists in museums, community-based organizations, and NGOs. The program will initially enroll a total of 5-7 new students in the Fall semester of each year.    For Examples of Student Work    Visit our Art, Education, and Community Practice blog .

Art: Practice and Ideas examines key developments in the visual arts from modernity to the present. Focusing on the ways in which representations both create &amp; reflect the values of a society, the course introduces students to the full range of expressive possibilities within the visual arts, covering painting &amp; sculpture, as well as photography, film, video, conceptual art, &amp; computer media. Topics to be covered include classical, modern, &amp; postmodern relationships to politics, vision, the mind, the body, psychology, gender, difference, &amp; technological innovation. Students will see and understand how artists have integrated perceptions of their historical moment, as well as physical &amp; social space, into creative practices that have, in turn, had a significant impact on the culture of the time. ARTCR-UE 0050 Modern Art and Contemporary Culture Examines the impact of modernism in both its historic &amp; contemporary relationships to culture &amp; society, through the study of painting, sculpture, architecture, &amp; the media arts from the late 1800&rsquo;s to the late 1950s. Art history with a theoretical &amp; aesthetic emphasis. Relates the art of the period to political, social, &amp; philosophical issues &amp; to current debates. Works of art are considered from slides, films, and reproductions. ART-UE 1914 Interdisciplinary Projects: Representation and Identity Open only to art majors or by permission. Prerequisite: three semesters of painting. Consideration of particular techniques allows students to broaden the range of their skills and expression. This is a studio class. Each week begins with a 20-minute discussion of current gallery or museum exhibitions that we have seen. Critiques will be every 3rd week. Students will be expected to work on their own ideas or projects. I will work with each student based on where they are in that process. Technical advice will be individual as well. Students are encourage to fully investigate their materials during this class. If there is a need for specific assignments this will be done on an individual basis. Students are encouraged to keep drawing journals and start a file of resource material with their paintings in mind. ART-UE 1391 Advanced Projects in Digital Art: \"Mind Remapping\" In this course, students will develop projects that use, critique and expand the notion and boundaries of digital media. The exploration of the mind's own processing of information will be a conceptual foundation for the course as we examine the ways in which digital tools mimic, respond to and amplify human desire. Media in the class will range from images and animation to video and music. The class will be an opportunity to both learn new tools and deepen skills already begun. Projects will be presented and discussed. ART-UE 1393 Advanced Projects in Art &amp; Media: &ldquo;Performance and Photo/Video&rdquo; This class will utilize each student&rsquo;s body in situ or in photography or video to demonstrate issues that transcend the particular aura of the individual and spread ideas into and from culture.
