Designed for students with little or no prior musical training, the course will use the theme of song and dance to introduce the subject. We will cover numerous ways of making music, including amateur and professional, solitary and communal, religious and secular, commercial and non-commercial (\"art\"), live and recorded, improvised and notated. The course will explore primarily Western European and African-American traditions and music - classical, popular, and experimental - that join the two, but also some other traditions from around the world. Students will participate through reading, writing, singing, dancing, and even improvising. They will gain direct, hands-on experience with music grasp and internalize sophisticated concepts of musical style and form, and come to understand how different types of music evolved. Students will be evaluated based on class participation, presentations, and short writing assignments.

It includes a discussion of historical background and evolution. The focus is on concepts and notation of key, scale, tonality, and rhythm. Related skills in sight-singing, dictation, and keyboard harmony are stressed in the recitation sections. Course counts toward the music minor but not the music major Topics in 20th Century Music: Sounds of the Cold War - MUSIC-UA 111 Tuesday &amp; Thursday 11:00 - 12:15 (Silver 218) Instructor: Brigid Cohen This course focuses on musical communities from the last half of the twentieth century, with a special focus on music's role in cultural diplomacy, technical experimentation, protest, and the imagination of alternative social realities. Musical dialogues with the visual arts and literature will receive special attention. The course will also take advantage of the resources of the city, involving research in local archives and attendance of and participation in musical concerts and happenings. Area of Study: Analytical and Critical Thinking Anthropology of Music: African Music - MUSIC-UA 153 Monday &amp; Wednesday 3:30-4:45 (Silver 320) Instructor: Christine Dang This course explores the sounds, contexts, and ideas of music-making in contemporary Africa. Through readings in literature, history, and cultural studies - in addition to analysis of recordings and films - we study the ways African communities use music to represent their beliefs and practices and to respond to the institutions dominating their societies. Through reading and listening, we raise questions about the historical itineraries linking distant musical communities across North, South, East, and West Africa; about the dynamic relationship between religion, culture, and politics as expressed in musical performance; about the categories of traditional, popular, and sacred musics - and the spaces of creativity and community in between these categories; about musical memory of the pre-colonial past, colonialism, and African independence; and finally, about musical imaginations of African unity and African futures. The music we listen to ranges from oral praise poetry, to indigenous initiation songs, to Africa Islamic poetry and choral hymns, to a variety of popular genres such as Algerian ra \u00ef , Senegalese mbalax , South African jazz, and Ethiopian rap. Our readings will include both academic literature and musical writings by African authors such as Francis Bebey, J.H. Kwabena Nketia, Chinua Achebe, Cheikh Anta Diop, L \u00e9 opold S \u00e9dar Senghor, and Wol \u00e9 Soyinka. No musical experience is necessary.

Recordings and live performances present the extraordinary range of singing styles and the musical instruments employed in each culture, including harps, bagpipes, and a variety of other wind, free reed, keyboard, and stringed instruments. Forms and musical styles are explored in depth, along with a study of their origin, evolution, and cultural links. Area of Study: Music, Histories, Cultures Seminar: Aural Perception - MUSIC-UA 193 Monday &amp; Wednesday 11:00 - 12:15 (Silver 320) Additional recitation section required Instructor: Jaime Oliver A broad interdisciplinary exploration of listening in musical and non-musical contexts, the course is designed to help students (a) deepen their understanding of the dynamics of listening, (b) gain an appreciation for modes of listening that have emerged around different musical styles, and (c) become more virtuosic and attentive listeners themselves. Students will learn how medical professionals, philosophers, composers, and laypeople conceptualize the act of listening. Live musicians will be invited into the classroom to make music and talk about what they heard in their own performances. During a weekly recitation, students will engage in regular listening experiments, and design experiments of their own. No prior knowledge of music is needed. This course is required for music majors, and recommended for other adventurous students with an interest in music and/or sound.
