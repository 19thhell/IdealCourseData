As psychologists, our particular  interest is in the factors that shape people's motivations when they are  dealing with others in group settings.      Because  justice has been found to be especially important to people's motivation  when dealing with others, we study social justice. In particular, our  work focuses on the psychology of procedural justice - the fairness of  group rules and processes. Research consistently finds that people  are strongly influenced by their assessments of procedural justice when  they are evaluating authorities and institutions.

There are two aspects of such cooperation. First, there is deference to authority. The study of regulation is generally concerned with understanding why people accept the decisions made by others. Legitimacy, the quality of being viewed as being entitled to be obeyed, is consistently linked to exercising authority in fair ways.   Because of its implications for regulation, my work has always shared a connection with the concerns of the field of law. The question of how to manage undesirable behavior is central to the work of legal authorities, and I examine the motivations that shape people's rule-related behavior.         My primary book on this topic (Tyler, 2006) establishes the key role of legitimacy in shaping obedience to the law. That finding is important to bringing psychology into social regulation, since the study of law-related behavior had been dominated by economics analysis linking behavior to sanctions. My work shows that people will also take one the responsibility for obeying the law when asked to do so by a legitimate authority. In other words, people become self-regulatory. The further finding in my work that procedural justice is a key antecedent of legitimacy has led to a literature on procedural justice in legal institutions and in interactions with legal authorities.   The findings of this book have been widely cited within law. They are important because the question of how to motivate compliance with law and legal rules is central to many areas of law and these findings therefore have wide applicability. Recent applications include the study of commitment hearings in mental hospitals, people's reactions to mass tort settlements, the emergence of international law, and the popularity of mediation hearings.

N.Y.: Russell-Sage Foundation.       My most recent contribution to this literature is my book Trust in the Law (Tyler and Huo, 2002) which explores deference to legal authorities among minorities. This book builds upon the earlier book Why People Obey the Law and again shows that procedural justice is a key antecedent of deference and of legitimacy. However, in Trust in the Law , ethnic group differences are more directly addressed. This book argues that legal authorities can build on the strong procedural justice findings I outline in my work to create a new model of regulation. I refer to that model as process-based regulation.   Trust in the Law is based on a sample of interviews with White, African-American, and Hispanic residents of these two cities. The focus of the study is on people's voluntary acceptance of decisions made by legal authorities. The results show that people's willingness to defer to legal authorities is shaped by two social motivations: procedural justice and motive-based trust. This finding suggests that authorities have considerable ability to gain deference from community members by treating them in ways that encourage judgments that the procedures used are fair and the motives underlying actions are benevolent. The study indicates that treating people with dignity and respect heightens both of these judgments.      Trust  and confidence in the police and courts     A second project using this approach explores people's overall trust and confidence in the legitimacy of the police and the courts. This set of studies is concerned with the way that the average community resident makes evaluations of legal authorities, irrespective of whether they have had a personal experience with those authorities. Again, the question I am concerned with is the degree to which process issues shape public evaluations. A contrasting view is that often associated with the NYPD and its aggressive policing policies. That view is that the middle class is primarily interested in crime reduction and accepts the occurrence of unfair treatment toward, at least, minorities in the service of that goal. Several studies of mine suggest that this belief is not correct. In a reanalysis of previously collected surveys, I showed that people's evaluations of the police and courts are heavily influenced by procedural justice based judgments.   Recently, I have been studying public views about the police and policing activities a sample of New Yorkers will be interviewed this summer about their views on the police, as well as about their personal experiences with police officers through interviews over the telephone with New Yorkers.   Why do these interviews? We live in the midst of difficult and changing times. The events of September 11th highlight the risks of terrorism in America, while recent budget reductions make clear that we are living in a time of fiscal limits. No agency is more strongly affected by these changes than the New York City Police Department. To most effectively manage policing activities during these changing times, we need to have a clear understanding of how the public views the police. It is for this reason that we are conducting interviews with the residents of different neighborhoods in New York City. The interviews provide valuable feedback to those managing the police department and the city about public views regarding the activities of the NYPD. To this end, I have been conducting surveys of the residents of New York to better understand how people feel about policing services in their neighborhoods.   Anti-terror policing   I am currently studying how policing tactics are experienced among Islamic Americans, the targets of anti-terror policing. My argument is that cooperation from the community diminishes when people feel that they are being singled out for unfair policing activities. To understand the experiments of members of the community I am conducting interviews in Brooklyn and London.      Policy initiatives   The Administrative Office of the Courts in California has launched a five year initiative on Procedural Fairness in the California Courts. The goal is to redesign the courts with an eye toward procedural justice.   The Russell Sage Foundation created a working group on legitimacy in the criminal justice system which produced a volume on the issue of legitimacy as it influences policing in societies around the world. That volume is titled Legitimacy and Criminal Justice.   I have presented several lectures on legitimacy in the criminal justice system. The first was the Montesquieu Lecture at Tilburg University. I also presented the keynote address at the European Society of Criminology and gave the Reckless/Dinitz Memorial Lecture at Ohio State University. The general theme of these presentations is the need to shift the focus of criminal justice toward creating and maintaining legitimacy.   Readings on law and regulation   Tyler, T.R. (1988).

The  Psychology of Justice            I am interested in understanding why people care about and react to their evaluations of the fairness or unfairness of procedures. The procedural justice effect has emerged as a robust and compelling one, with people shown to react to how decisions are made in a wide variety of groups, organizations, and societies.    In early studies, I looked at psychological models of the justice motive, and argued that people are concerned about issues of identity and status. Further, I suggested that people use the justice of procedures to tell them about their status and to evaluate the degree to which they want to define their identity in terms of groups to which they belong (Lind and Tyler, 1988; Tyler and Lind, 1992).   This idea unfolds in my work two ways. First, in the finding that people care about the fairness of procedures more than about the favorability or fairness of outcomes. Early justice research focused primarily on issues of equity (outcome fairness) on the assumption that outcomes are the key issue. My work helped to shift the focus to issues of procedure by showing the importance of procedural justice judgments.   Second, my work helped to establish that people do not view procedures in instrumental terms, i.e. as a way to obtain outcomes. That view is explicit in the classic work on procedural justice by John Thibaut and Laurens Walker (1975). Instead, procedures are valued because they communicate status and inclusion in groups (Lind and Tyler, 1988). This distinction between instrumental and value-expressive or relational motivations underlying procedural justice effects has transformed the way that psychologists think about the meaning and implications of procedural justice findings.   I have extended this line of thinking to the study of authority relations (Tyler and Lind, 1992) arguing that people view group authorities as representatives of the group, and are therefore sensitive to how those authorities exercise their authority. Using fair procedures to exercise authority both communicates that the people one is dealing with are respected by the group, and it suggests that the group is one that is worth identifying with and being involved in.   Most recently, my work has sought to understand the relationship between justice and identity. I view justice as a key issue that people focus on when trying to define themselves and their relationship to their group.         back to the top             Readings   on the Psychology of Justice:                     Lind, E.A., and Tyler , T.R.

This is true in communities, with government, and in work settings. Tyler and Blader (2000) examine this connection in work settings, showing that employees are strongly influenced by the fairness of group decision-making procedures.    My work also connects with the field  of organizational behavior in schools of management. It has been widely  demonstrated that many key work-related behaviors (job performance, absenteeism,  turnover, sabotage, etc.) are shaped by the procedural justice of the workplace.  As in other arenas, management theory has been dominated by models that  root human motivation in incentives and sanctions. Hence, this demonstration  that there are broader motivations on which managers can draw has been  widely noticed. In particular, discussions about work increasingly recognize  the importance of motivating voluntary (extra-role) behavior in workers.  This type of behavior is especially poorly motivated by incentives and  sanctions. As a consequence, the social psychological model must become  more central to our understanding of work related behaviors.     My recent  work seeks to develop a framework within which to understand motivation  in work settings. I have conducted interviews with a sample of employees  in   New York   companies (Tyler and Blader, 2000) and have studied corporate bankers in a large multinational firm. At this time, I am conducting a panel study of a sample of American workers through Knowledge Networks. My goal in this work is to develop arguments about the impact of work climate on the behavior of those within them. Instead of stressing mechanisms of accountability linked to rewards and punishments, my basic argument is that those employees who are treated fairly by their superiors will be motivated to perform well on their jobs.     back to the top                                      Recommended Readings on Cooperation:               Kramer, R., and Tyler, T.R.

As psychologists, our particular  interest is in the factors that shape people's motivations when they are  dealing with others in group settings.      Because  justice has been found to be especially important to people's motivation  when dealing with others, we study social justice. In particular, our  work focuses on the psychology of procedural justice - the fairness of  group rules and processes. Research consistently finds that people  are strongly influenced by their assessments of procedural justice when  they are evaluating authorities and institutions.

There are two aspects of such cooperation. First, there is deference to authority. The study of regulation is generally concerned with understanding why people accept the decisions made by others. Legitimacy, the quality of being viewed as being entitled to be obeyed, is consistently linked to exercising authority in fair ways.   Because of its implications for regulation, my work has always shared a connection with the concerns of the field of law. The question of how to manage undesirable behavior is central to the work of legal authorities, and I examine the motivations that shape people's rule-related behavior.         My primary book on this topic (Tyler, 2006) establishes the key role of legitimacy in shaping obedience to the law. That finding is important to bringing psychology into social regulation, since the study of law-related behavior had been dominated by economics analysis linking behavior to sanctions. My work shows that people will also take one the responsibility for obeying the law when asked to do so by a legitimate authority. In other words, people become self-regulatory. The further finding in my work that procedural justice is a key antecedent of legitimacy has led to a literature on procedural justice in legal institutions and in interactions with legal authorities.   The findings of this book have been widely cited within law. They are important because the question of how to motivate compliance with law and legal rules is central to many areas of law and these findings therefore have wide applicability. Recent applications include the study of commitment hearings in mental hospitals, people's reactions to mass tort settlements, the emergence of international law, and the popularity of mediation hearings.      See:        Tyler  , T.R. (1990). Why people obey the law .   New Haven : Yale.       Reissued with a new afterword: (2006). Princeton  University  Press.             Tyler , T.R. (2006).

N.Y.: Russell-Sage Foundation.       My most recent contribution to this literature is my book Trust in the Law (Tyler and Huo, 2002) which explores deference to legal authorities among minorities. This book builds upon the earlier book Why People Obey the Law and again shows that procedural justice is a key antecedent of deference and of legitimacy. However, in Trust in the Law , ethnic group differences are more directly addressed. This book argues that legal authorities can build on the strong procedural justice findings I outline in my work to create a new model of regulation. I refer to that model as process-based regulation.   Trust in the Law is based on a sample of interviews with White, African-American, and Hispanic residents of these two cities. The focus of the study is on people's voluntary acceptance of decisions made by legal authorities. The results show that people's willingness to defer to legal authorities is shaped by two social motivations: procedural justice and motive-based trust. This finding suggests that authorities have considerable ability to gain deference from community members by treating them in ways that encourage judgments that the procedures used are fair and the motives underlying actions are benevolent. The study indicates that treating people with dignity and respect heightens both of these judgments.      Trust  and confidence in the police and courts     A second project using this approach explores people's overall trust and confidence in the legitimacy of the police and the courts. This set of studies is concerned with the way that the average community resident makes evaluations of legal authorities, irrespective of whether they have had a personal experience with those authorities. Again, the question I am concerned with is the degree to which process issues shape public evaluations. A contrasting view is that often associated with the NYPD and its aggressive policing policies. That view is that the middle class is primarily interested in crime reduction and accepts the occurrence of unfair treatment toward, at least, minorities in the service of that goal. Several studies of mine suggest that this belief is not correct. In a reanalysis of previously collected surveys, I showed that people's evaluations of the police and courts are heavily influenced by procedural justice based judgments.   Recently, I have been studying public views about the police and policing activities a sample of New Yorkers will be interviewed this summer about their views on the police, as well as about their personal experiences with police officers through interviews over the telephone with New Yorkers.   Why do these interviews? We live in the midst of difficult and changing times. The events of September 11th highlight the risks of terrorism in America, while recent budget reductions make clear that we are living in a time of fiscal limits. No agency is more strongly affected by these changes than the New York City Police Department. To most effectively manage policing activities during these changing times, we need to have a clear understanding of how the public views the police. It is for this reason that we are conducting interviews with the residents of different neighborhoods in New York City. The interviews provide valuable feedback to those managing the police department and the city about public views regarding the activities of the NYPD. To this end, I have been conducting surveys of the residents of New York to better understand how people feel about policing services in their neighborhoods.   Anti-terror policing   I am currently studying how policing tactics are experienced among Islamic Americans, the targets of anti-terror policing. My argument is that cooperation from the community diminishes when people feel that they are being singled out for unfair policing activities. To understand the experiments of members of the community I am conducting interviews in Brooklyn and London.      Policy initiatives   The Administrative Office of the Courts in California has launched a five year initiative on Procedural Fairness in the California Courts. The goal is to redesign the courts with an eye toward procedural justice.   The Russell Sage Foundation created a working group on legitimacy in the criminal justice system which produced a volume on the issue of legitimacy as it influences policing in societies around the world. That volume is titled Legitimacy and Criminal Justice.   I have presented several lectures on legitimacy in the criminal justice system. The first was the Montesquieu Lecture at Tilburg University. I also presented the keynote address at the European Society of Criminology and gave the Reckless/Dinitz Memorial Lecture at Ohio State University. The general theme of these presentations is the need to shift the focus of criminal justice toward creating and maintaining legitimacy.   Readings on law and regulation   Tyler, T.R. (1988).

The  Psychology of Justice            I am interested in understanding why people care about and react to their evaluations of the fairness or unfairness of procedures. The procedural justice effect has emerged as a robust and compelling one, with people shown to react to how decisions are made in a wide variety of groups, organizations, and societies.    In early studies, I looked at psychological models of the justice motive, and argued that people are concerned about issues of identity and status. Further, I suggested that people use the justice of procedures to tell them about their status and to evaluate the degree to which they want to define their identity in terms of groups to which they belong (Lind and Tyler, 1988; Tyler and Lind, 1992).   This idea unfolds in my work two ways. First, in the finding that people care about the fairness of procedures more than about the favorability or fairness of outcomes. Early justice research focused primarily on issues of equity (outcome fairness) on the assumption that outcomes are the key issue. My work helped to shift the focus to issues of procedure by showing the importance of procedural justice judgments.   Second, my work helped to establish that people do not view procedures in instrumental terms, i.e. as a way to obtain outcomes. That view is explicit in the classic work on procedural justice by John Thibaut and Laurens Walker (1975). Instead, procedures are valued because they communicate status and inclusion in groups (Lind and Tyler, 1988). This distinction between instrumental and value-expressive or relational motivations underlying procedural justice effects has transformed the way that psychologists think about the meaning and implications of procedural justice findings.   I have extended this line of thinking to the study of authority relations (Tyler and Lind, 1992) arguing that people view group authorities as representatives of the group, and are therefore sensitive to how those authorities exercise their authority. Using fair procedures to exercise authority both communicates that the people one is dealing with are respected by the group, and it suggests that the group is one that is worth identifying with and being involved in.   Most recently, my work has sought to understand the relationship between justice and identity. I view justice as a key issue that people focus on when trying to define themselves and their relationship to their group.         back to the top             Readings   on the Psychology of Justice:                     Lind, E.A., and Tyler , T.R.

Hence, my work on the basis of deference to authorities has been important in discussions about how to govern society.    In particular,  I have written about the problems associated with governance in diverse,  multicultural, societies. As I noted above, Trust in the Law discusses issues of diversity and multiculturalism  as those issues are important to the rules of law.

This is true in communities, with government, and in work settings. Tyler and Blader (2000) examine this connection in work settings, showing that employees are strongly influenced by the fairness of group decision-making procedures.    My work also connects with the field  of organizational behavior in schools of management. It has been widely  demonstrated that many key work-related behaviors (job performance, absenteeism,  turnover, sabotage, etc.) are shaped by the procedural justice of the workplace.  As in other arenas, management theory has been dominated by models that  root human motivation in incentives and sanctions. Hence, this demonstration  that there are broader motivations on which managers can draw has been  widely noticed. In particular, discussions about work increasingly recognize  the importance of motivating voluntary (extra-role) behavior in workers.  This type of behavior is especially poorly motivated by incentives and  sanctions. As a consequence, the social psychological model must become  more central to our understanding of work related behaviors.     My recent  work seeks to develop a framework within which to understand motivation  in work settings. I have conducted interviews with a sample of employees  in   New York   companies (Tyler and Blader, 2000) and have studied corporate bankers in a large multinational firm. At this time, I am conducting a panel study of a sample of American workers through Knowledge Networks. My goal in this work is to develop arguments about the impact of work climate on the behavior of those within them. Instead of stressing mechanisms of accountability linked to rewards and punishments, my basic argument is that those employees who are treated fairly by their superiors will be motivated to perform well on their jobs.     back to the top                                      Recommended Readings on Cooperation:               Kramer, R., and Tyler, T.R.

Gentrification: How Well Do You Know Your Neighbors?                      Set in the context of the controversial 2004 re-design of the Fulton Mall in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, the film explores the forces reshaping neighborhoods along race and class lines through the eyes of a \u201cgentrifier.\u201d It addresses the conflicting views of gentrification as community revitalization versus a force that is erasing the rich social and cultural history of New York\u2019s neighborhoods along socioeconomic lines. The film hopes to discuss how citizens can actively fix a broken urban planning process. The film will provide a framework for the accompanying seminar on the changing socio-economic landscape in New York City.

As social workers and policy makers, we need to gain a better understand of this population and develop culturally competent and appropriate services for the culturally and socioeconomically diverse communities in the Bronx. Participants will engage in panels and small group discussions on educational, health, and criminal justice issues faced by adolescents in the Bronx, and learn about ways that they can become engaged with initiatives in underserved neighborhoods and best serve adolescents to help them achieve their goals.                                                      Images and Talks: The Social Climate Among Diverse LGBTQ Populations in NYC                      The global social and political landscape for LGBTQ populations are changing rapidly. With a special focus on the Asian-Pacific Islander cultural experience, participants will gain insight into the international social and cultural atmosphere for a marginalized population through lectures from scholars, personal stories from students and individuals who identify as LGBTQ, and small group discussions. The event will also feature an art exhibition by a New York-based artist who focuses on creating images that reflect on the media\u2019s effect on how LGBTQ individuals are viewed by themselves and by society.                                           2012 - 2013 Grantees                                            Cross Cultural Social Work in the Criminal Justice System                      The program began with a week-long film series featuring films (\u201cSing Sing University,\u201d \u201cabUSed: The Postville Raid,\u201d \u201cCruel and Unusual,\u201d and \u201cThe House I Live In\u201d) that explored the experiences of imprisoned racial minority, immigrant, and transgender populations. Following the screenings, a one-day symposium hosted a panel discussion that addressed the dynamics of race, gender, sexuality, and culture among these, and other, vulnerable incarcerated populations. The panel also considered possibilities for change and reform.     In addition to several student groups, the symposium included the involvement of a number of community organizations, including speakers from Hudson Link, Families for Freedom, the Vera Institute, the Drug Policy Alliance, Communities United for Police Reform, New York State Prison Justice Network, Sylvia Rivera Law Project, Appellate Defenders, Wal-Mart Free NYC and the New York City Department of Probation.                                                    Furiendly Visits: Animal Assisted Therapy with Older Adults                      The two-part program served to highlight the older adult population, the fastest-growing age demographic in New York City, and indeed, nationally, as well as the growing practice of non-traditional therapies, including animal-assisted therapy. Silver MSW students, along with the Animal Assisted Therapy in Social Work, and Gerontology groups, brought dog therapy teams to the Square to provide a therapeutic environment for older adults in the community, and hosted a second event for students.   Community partner organizations included Greenwich House, The Good Dog Foundation, A Fair Shake for Youth, and Puppies Behind Bars.                                                    International Climate Change Think Tank Conference                      Three Silver interns at the Unitarian Universalist United Nations Office (UU-UNO) collaborated with UU-UNO staff members and other MSW and Global Affairs international students to identify and share research on climate change issues in their home countries. In their conference, \u201cSmall Island States: A New Endangered Species,\u201d participants explored social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture as it applies specifically to climate change issues in vulnerable small island states, and, more broadly, aimed to promote international social justice by analyzing national environmental policies which already exist or which can be improved to better protect its citizens. Participating students presented research to one another and to key UU-UNO representatives, and identified future potential directions on how to improve climate change policies.   Community organization involved in this program were the Unitarian Universalist United Nations Office, and the NGO Committee on Disarmament, Peace, and Security.                                                    Pride and Prejudice: LGBT Minorities in Traditional Faith-Based Communities                      The program brought two panels of LGBTQA community members to talk about how their Queer identities relate to their diverse cultural and faith identities. The first, which focused on the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda and Nigeria, discussed the current social climate in these countries with respect to views on LGBTQ individuals from a \u201cvalues\u201d perspective and potential pathways to change. The second event focused on the controversial practices of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d and other religiously influenced therapeutic messages, looking more broadly at how faith, culture, and religion play a role in therapy for both patients and professionals. The panels explored how the development of LGBTQA identities may create new opportunities for peace and reconciliation in other cultural and faith conflicts. The program also gave a select number of students the opportunity to participate in the \u201cCreating Change\u201d National Conference on LGBT Equality in Atlanta in June 2013.   Community partners for this program included The NYU Center for Spiritual Life, The Unitarian Universalist Association United Nations Office, and Jewish Queer Youth (JQY).

As psychologists, our particular  interest is in the factors that shape people's motivations when they are  dealing with others in group settings.      Because  justice has been found to be especially important to people's motivation  when dealing with others, we study social justice. In particular, our  work focuses on the psychology of procedural justice - the fairness of  group rules and processes. Research consistently finds that people  are strongly influenced by their assessments of procedural justice when  they are evaluating authorities and institutions.

There are two aspects of such cooperation. First, there is deference to authority. The study of regulation is generally concerned with understanding why people accept the decisions made by others. Legitimacy, the quality of being viewed as being entitled to be obeyed, is consistently linked to exercising authority in fair ways.   Because of its implications for regulation, my work has always shared a connection with the concerns of the field of law. The question of how to manage undesirable behavior is central to the work of legal authorities, and I examine the motivations that shape people's rule-related behavior.         My primary book on this topic (Tyler, 2006) establishes the key role of legitimacy in shaping obedience to the law. That finding is important to bringing psychology into social regulation, since the study of law-related behavior had been dominated by economics analysis linking behavior to sanctions. My work shows that people will also take one the responsibility for obeying the law when asked to do so by a legitimate authority. In other words, people become self-regulatory. The further finding in my work that procedural justice is a key antecedent of legitimacy has led to a literature on procedural justice in legal institutions and in interactions with legal authorities.   The findings of this book have been widely cited within law. They are important because the question of how to motivate compliance with law and legal rules is central to many areas of law and these findings therefore have wide applicability. Recent applications include the study of commitment hearings in mental hospitals, people's reactions to mass tort settlements, the emergence of international law, and the popularity of mediation hearings.

N.Y.: Russell-Sage Foundation.       My most recent contribution to this literature is my book Trust in the Law (Tyler and Huo, 2002) which explores deference to legal authorities among minorities. This book builds upon the earlier book Why People Obey the Law and again shows that procedural justice is a key antecedent of deference and of legitimacy. However, in Trust in the Law , ethnic group differences are more directly addressed. This book argues that legal authorities can build on the strong procedural justice findings I outline in my work to create a new model of regulation. I refer to that model as process-based regulation.   Trust in the Law is based on a sample of interviews with White, African-American, and Hispanic residents of these two cities. The focus of the study is on people's voluntary acceptance of decisions made by legal authorities. The results show that people's willingness to defer to legal authorities is shaped by two social motivations: procedural justice and motive-based trust. This finding suggests that authorities have considerable ability to gain deference from community members by treating them in ways that encourage judgments that the procedures used are fair and the motives underlying actions are benevolent. The study indicates that treating people with dignity and respect heightens both of these judgments.      Trust  and confidence in the police and courts     A second project using this approach explores people's overall trust and confidence in the legitimacy of the police and the courts. This set of studies is concerned with the way that the average community resident makes evaluations of legal authorities, irrespective of whether they have had a personal experience with those authorities. Again, the question I am concerned with is the degree to which process issues shape public evaluations. A contrasting view is that often associated with the NYPD and its aggressive policing policies. That view is that the middle class is primarily interested in crime reduction and accepts the occurrence of unfair treatment toward, at least, minorities in the service of that goal. Several studies of mine suggest that this belief is not correct. In a reanalysis of previously collected surveys, I showed that people's evaluations of the police and courts are heavily influenced by procedural justice based judgments.   Recently, I have been studying public views about the police and policing activities a sample of New Yorkers will be interviewed this summer about their views on the police, as well as about their personal experiences with police officers through interviews over the telephone with New Yorkers.   Why do these interviews? We live in the midst of difficult and changing times. The events of September 11th highlight the risks of terrorism in America, while recent budget reductions make clear that we are living in a time of fiscal limits. No agency is more strongly affected by these changes than the New York City Police Department. To most effectively manage policing activities during these changing times, we need to have a clear understanding of how the public views the police. It is for this reason that we are conducting interviews with the residents of different neighborhoods in New York City. The interviews provide valuable feedback to those managing the police department and the city about public views regarding the activities of the NYPD. To this end, I have been conducting surveys of the residents of New York to better understand how people feel about policing services in their neighborhoods.   Anti-terror policing   I am currently studying how policing tactics are experienced among Islamic Americans, the targets of anti-terror policing. My argument is that cooperation from the community diminishes when people feel that they are being singled out for unfair policing activities. To understand the experiments of members of the community I am conducting interviews in Brooklyn and London.      Policy initiatives   The Administrative Office of the Courts in California has launched a five year initiative on Procedural Fairness in the California Courts. The goal is to redesign the courts with an eye toward procedural justice.   The Russell Sage Foundation created a working group on legitimacy in the criminal justice system which produced a volume on the issue of legitimacy as it influences policing in societies around the world. That volume is titled Legitimacy and Criminal Justice.   I have presented several lectures on legitimacy in the criminal justice system. The first was the Montesquieu Lecture at Tilburg University. I also presented the keynote address at the European Society of Criminology and gave the Reckless/Dinitz Memorial Lecture at Ohio State University. The general theme of these presentations is the need to shift the focus of criminal justice toward creating and maintaining legitimacy.   Readings on law and regulation   Tyler, T.R. (1988).

The  Psychology of Justice            I am interested in understanding why people care about and react to their evaluations of the fairness or unfairness of procedures. The procedural justice effect has emerged as a robust and compelling one, with people shown to react to how decisions are made in a wide variety of groups, organizations, and societies.    In early studies, I looked at psychological models of the justice motive, and argued that people are concerned about issues of identity and status. Further, I suggested that people use the justice of procedures to tell them about their status and to evaluate the degree to which they want to define their identity in terms of groups to which they belong (Lind and Tyler, 1988; Tyler and Lind, 1992).   This idea unfolds in my work two ways. First, in the finding that people care about the fairness of procedures more than about the favorability or fairness of outcomes. Early justice research focused primarily on issues of equity (outcome fairness) on the assumption that outcomes are the key issue. My work helped to shift the focus to issues of procedure by showing the importance of procedural justice judgments.   Second, my work helped to establish that people do not view procedures in instrumental terms, i.e. as a way to obtain outcomes. That view is explicit in the classic work on procedural justice by John Thibaut and Laurens Walker (1975). Instead, procedures are valued because they communicate status and inclusion in groups (Lind and Tyler, 1988). This distinction between instrumental and value-expressive or relational motivations underlying procedural justice effects has transformed the way that psychologists think about the meaning and implications of procedural justice findings.   I have extended this line of thinking to the study of authority relations (Tyler and Lind, 1992) arguing that people view group authorities as representatives of the group, and are therefore sensitive to how those authorities exercise their authority. Using fair procedures to exercise authority both communicates that the people one is dealing with are respected by the group, and it suggests that the group is one that is worth identifying with and being involved in.   Most recently, my work has sought to understand the relationship between justice and identity. I view justice as a key issue that people focus on when trying to define themselves and their relationship to their group.         back to the top             Readings   on the Psychology of Justice:                     Lind, E.A., and Tyler , T.R.

This is true in communities, with government, and in work settings. Tyler and Blader (2000) examine this connection in work settings, showing that employees are strongly influenced by the fairness of group decision-making procedures.    My work also connects with the field  of organizational behavior in schools of management. It has been widely  demonstrated that many key work-related behaviors (job performance, absenteeism,  turnover, sabotage, etc.) are shaped by the procedural justice of the workplace.  As in other arenas, management theory has been dominated by models that  root human motivation in incentives and sanctions. Hence, this demonstration  that there are broader motivations on which managers can draw has been  widely noticed. In particular, discussions about work increasingly recognize  the importance of motivating voluntary (extra-role) behavior in workers.  This type of behavior is especially poorly motivated by incentives and  sanctions. As a consequence, the social psychological model must become  more central to our understanding of work related behaviors.     My recent  work seeks to develop a framework within which to understand motivation  in work settings. I have conducted interviews with a sample of employees  in   New York   companies (Tyler and Blader, 2000) and have studied corporate bankers in a large multinational firm. At this time, I am conducting a panel study of a sample of American workers through Knowledge Networks. My goal in this work is to develop arguments about the impact of work climate on the behavior of those within them. Instead of stressing mechanisms of accountability linked to rewards and punishments, my basic argument is that those employees who are treated fairly by their superiors will be motivated to perform well on their jobs.     back to the top                                      Recommended Readings on Cooperation:               Kramer, R., and Tyler, T.R.

Gentrification: How Well Do You Know Your Neighbors?                      Set in the context of the controversial 2004 re-design of the Fulton Mall in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, the film explores the forces reshaping neighborhoods along race and class lines through the eyes of a \u201cgentrifier.\u201d It addresses the conflicting views of gentrification as community revitalization versus a force that is erasing the rich social and cultural history of New York\u2019s neighborhoods along socioeconomic lines. The film hopes to discuss how citizens can actively fix a broken urban planning process. The film will provide a framework for the accompanying seminar on the changing socio-economic landscape in New York City.

As social workers and policy makers, we need to gain a better understand of this population and develop culturally competent and appropriate services for the culturally and socioeconomically diverse communities in the Bronx. Participants will engage in panels and small group discussions on educational, health, and criminal justice issues faced by adolescents in the Bronx, and learn about ways that they can become engaged with initiatives in underserved neighborhoods and best serve adolescents to help them achieve their goals.                                                      Images and Talks: The Social Climate Among Diverse LGBTQ Populations in NYC                      The global social and political landscape for LGBTQ populations are changing rapidly. With a special focus on the Asian-Pacific Islander cultural experience, participants will gain insight into the international social and cultural atmosphere for a marginalized population through lectures from scholars, personal stories from students and individuals who identify as LGBTQ, and small group discussions. The event will also feature an art exhibition by a New York-based artist who focuses on creating images that reflect on the media\u2019s effect on how LGBTQ individuals are viewed by themselves and by society.                                           2012 - 2013 Grantees                                            Cross Cultural Social Work in the Criminal Justice System                      The program began with a week-long film series featuring films (\u201cSing Sing University,\u201d \u201cabUSed: The Postville Raid,\u201d \u201cCruel and Unusual,\u201d and \u201cThe House I Live In\u201d) that explored the experiences of imprisoned racial minority, immigrant, and transgender populations. Following the screenings, a one-day symposium hosted a panel discussion that addressed the dynamics of race, gender, sexuality, and culture among these, and other, vulnerable incarcerated populations. The panel also considered possibilities for change and reform.     In addition to several student groups, the symposium included the involvement of a number of community organizations, including speakers from Hudson Link, Families for Freedom, the Vera Institute, the Drug Policy Alliance, Communities United for Police Reform, New York State Prison Justice Network, Sylvia Rivera Law Project, Appellate Defenders, Wal-Mart Free NYC and the New York City Department of Probation.                                                    Furiendly Visits: Animal Assisted Therapy with Older Adults                      The two-part program served to highlight the older adult population, the fastest-growing age demographic in New York City, and indeed, nationally, as well as the growing practice of non-traditional therapies, including animal-assisted therapy. Silver MSW students, along with the Animal Assisted Therapy in Social Work, and Gerontology groups, brought dog therapy teams to the Square to provide a therapeutic environment for older adults in the community, and hosted a second event for students.   Community partner organizations included Greenwich House, The Good Dog Foundation, A Fair Shake for Youth, and Puppies Behind Bars.                                                    International Climate Change Think Tank Conference                      Three Silver interns at the Unitarian Universalist United Nations Office (UU-UNO) collaborated with UU-UNO staff members and other MSW and Global Affairs international students to identify and share research on climate change issues in their home countries. In their conference, \u201cSmall Island States: A New Endangered Species,\u201d participants explored social policy, political strategy, economics, military, technology, and culture as it applies specifically to climate change issues in vulnerable small island states, and, more broadly, aimed to promote international social justice by analyzing national environmental policies which already exist or which can be improved to better protect its citizens. Participating students presented research to one another and to key UU-UNO representatives, and identified future potential directions on how to improve climate change policies.   Community organization involved in this program were the Unitarian Universalist United Nations Office, and the NGO Committee on Disarmament, Peace, and Security.                                                    Pride and Prejudice: LGBT Minorities in Traditional Faith-Based Communities                      The program brought two panels of LGBTQA community members to talk about how their Queer identities relate to their diverse cultural and faith identities. The first, which focused on the criminalization of homosexuality in Uganda and Nigeria, discussed the current social climate in these countries with respect to views on LGBTQ individuals from a \u201cvalues\u201d perspective and potential pathways to change. The second event focused on the controversial practices of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d and other religiously influenced therapeutic messages, looking more broadly at how faith, culture, and religion play a role in therapy for both patients and professionals. The panels explored how the development of LGBTQA identities may create new opportunities for peace and reconciliation in other cultural and faith conflicts. The program also gave a select number of students the opportunity to participate in the \u201cCreating Change\u201d National Conference on LGBT Equality in Atlanta in June 2013.   Community partners for this program included The NYU Center for Spiritual Life, The Unitarian Universalist Association United Nations Office, and Jewish Queer Youth (JQY).

Sociologists study the ways that social structures and interactions shape human life. We seek to understand the full range of social institutions and practices, from couples and small groups, to social organizations such as businesses and government agencies, to communities, cities, and nations.    Our methods of research are diverse, ranging from the quantitative analysis of large surveys to qualitative approaches such as in-depth interviewing, participant observation, and historical investigation. Indeed, diversity in its subject matter and its methods of research is one of sociology's most distinguishing features. Because sociologists study social interaction in a broad array of contexts, we use whatever method is appropriate for the particular question being posed.    Sociological ideas and methods are used by policy makers, political analysts, and social critics. Many of our concepts have become a part of our common culture and everyday language. Concepts such as \"the self-fulfilling prophecy,\" \"conspicuous consumption,\" \"WASP,\" \"social mobility,\" \"modernization,\" and \"in-groups\" and \"out-groups\" were all originally coined by sociologists.    Similarly, sociologists were studying important topics such as social inequality, race relations, gender discrimination, and sexual diversity long before these became issues of concern among policy makers and in popular culture. Many modern research techniques, such as polling and survey design, were also pioneered by sociologists.    NYU's Department of Sociology reflects the diversity of our discipline. The faculty includes experts in a wide range of subjects, including crime, law, and deviance; sex, gender, and the family; organizations, occupations, and work; immigration; justice; science, politics, social protest, and social policy; power and inequality in modern societies; welfare, culture, and education;and social theory. The faculty also uses a wide variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques in conducting research.    Whether the goal is to become an informed citizen, an expert in the social sciences, or a socially active trailblazer, we offer the tools and knowledge to help students make sense of the world around them. Those planning a professional career or graduate study in sociology or another social science will find a wide range of useful and interesting courses. Students preparing for careers in law, social service, health, public administration, and other professional areas can choose from many relevant substantive courses. Those interested in social research and policy making will benefit from courses that teach practical skills of data gathering and analysis. In all of these courses, we encourage students to study issues from a variety of perspectives.               Contact Us | &copy; New York University , Arts and Science"}]}]
