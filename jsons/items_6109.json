From researching the medications and devices that become standard care to ensuring that our medical students and residents are up-to-date on contraceptive technology, we specialize in these services that are vital to women's health.   Our Role in Research   NYU Langone Medical Center is a premiere research institution and we are proud to be part of the exciting work being done here every day. Our involvement in clinical research began in 1970. Since that time, we have participated in over 50 projects in various contraceptive technology. Many of the medications and devices were eventually marketed for general public use, including the Copper-T device, Pregestasert IUD, Loestrin OC, Norgestimate OC, Lunelle and Norplant subdermal implants.   In 1999 we were selected by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) , a branch of the National Institute of Health (NIH) , as one nine sites to participate in the Contraceptive Clinical Trial Network. Our work as part of the network continues today.   Our Role in Education   The primary goal of our division is to provide teaching, research and services for contraception and all other aspects of family planning and reproductive choice services. This is done in the classroom, as well as in a clinical setting at Bellevue Hospital's Clinic for Women's Health.   Medical Students: We provide didactic lectures and occasionally serve as preceptors for the medical students during their 6-week clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology .   Residents: ObGyn residents rotate through our division in their second year when they spend two months working in our Reproductive Choice Service at Bellevue Hospital. We also provide didactic lectures throughout the four-year residency program. Learn more about our residency program in obstetrics and gynecology .   Our Role in Patient Care   The clinical component of our division provides counseling, consultations and other services to Bellevue Hospital's Clinic for Women's Health and the Bellevue Hospital Reproductive Choice Service. Over ten thousand patients are seen each year, including postabortal and postpartum patients. Thanks to a grant from New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation , we are able to offer all patients contraceptive supplies free of charge.
