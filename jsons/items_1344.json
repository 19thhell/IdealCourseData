The interpretative classes will run concurrently with production management, sights and sound, and post-production workshops. The course will have three objectives: (1) teach students the documentary tradition from Flaherty to Rouch; (2) use critical Cinema theory to define a document with a camera; and (3) create a short documentary film.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Kwame Nkrumah: \u00a0A Critical Examination of His Life and Times -\u00a0SCA-UA 9181 \u00a0- 4 points                               This is an interdisciplinary course designed to study the life and times, intellectual thought and practical activity, of Ghana\u2019s first president, Kwame Nkrumah. With the use of a variety of readings and audio-visual materials, this course will critically explore the socioeconomic and political factors that served to shape the life, thought, and times of Kwame Nkrumah. The persons, ideas, and events that influenced Nkrumah and the ideas, persons and events that he also impacted will be covered as well. Students interested in sociology, history, political science, economics, and cultural studies will find this course of particular interest as its subject matter will dovetail into each of these related fields of study.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Society, Culture and Modernization in Ghana - SCA-UA\u00a09776 - 4 points                               The course introduces students to aspects of Ghanaian society and culture. It considers both traditional aspects of life and how people live their lives in this first decade of the new millennium. How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class. There will be a written examination at the end of the semester and a dissertation on an aspect of Ghanaian society and culture that students might choose to explore.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Colonialism and the Rise of Modern African Literature - COLIT-UA 9850 or SCA-UA\u00a09781 - 4 points                               Note: this course is open to all students for elective credit. Comparative   literature majors in track ii (literary and cultural studies) may count this   course toward one of their non-core major requirements.   The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Intensive Twi Language Course -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a0GHAN.002 - 4 points                               This is a language course designed to provide basic communicative competence in oral and written Twi for beginners.

Sample Syllabus                                                                    African Language Literatures -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09775 - 4 points                               This course provides students with knowledge of the diverse literatures composed and written in indigenous languages of Africa, as well as of the general issues relevant to the study of this literature. The languages covered include Swahili (East Africa), Hausa and Yoruba (Nigeria and West Africa), Xhosa (Southern Africa), and Somali (Horn of Africa). The literature is discussed largely according to major genre types, such as poetry and song, oral narratives, and written prose literature. No knowledge of these languages is required for the course.                                                                    Perspectives on African Experience - SCA-UA 9789 - 4 points                               The course familiarizes students with a selection of the varying perspectives from which African experience has been perceived, analyzed, and interpreted, primarily by Africans and persons of African descent, both on the continent and in the diaspora.                                                                    Language in Africa -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09911 - 4 points                               An introduction to thinking about the human faculty of language within a specifically African context. The course focuses on issues of language within the framework of human society at all levels, and not so much on language as a structural entity. Topics include the general characteristics of human language; the description of the languages of Africa; the question of language and cultural contact in Africa; and the contemporary issues of language and sociopolitics in Africa.                                                                    Contemporary African Literature -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09912 - 4 points                               The course examines not only the common concerns but also the diverse traditions, as a result of historical, social, and cultural imperatives, that have informed the literature produced by African writers. Topics include colonialism; the question of language; race and identity; nationalism and literature; modernity; exile; and the politics of gender in the African context.                                                                    Culture in Africa - SCA-UA 9913 - 4 points                               The aim of the course is to introduce students to cultural dimensions in Africa, and to ways of approaching the study of culture in Africa. It focuses on three overall themes: orality, performance and identity, exploring ways in which these find expression primarily (though not exclusively) through language, religious belief, music, literature, nationalism, and popular culture. After presenting a general theoretical framework for the study of the themes, it concentrates on specific cultural contexts, illustrated with &quot;case studies&quot;. Students are also encouraged to do further reading within other culture areas of Africa and the African Diaspora.                          Paris                                                    French-African Relations -\u00a0SCA-UA 9914 or HIST-UA 9510 - 4 points                               A historical and political inquiry into the French system of relations with Francophone Africa from the \u2018race to Empire\u2019 in the 19th century to the current day. The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France. Conducted in French.

The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.       Sample Syllabus                                                                        Indigenous Australian Art: An Analytical Survey - ANTH-UA 9038 or SCA-UA 9836 - 4 points                               This course is a survey of the principal themes and issues in the development of Indigenous art in Australia. It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

Berlin,  a city in constant transformation itself, offers an enormous variety of sites and  layers of history, providing locations and ambience for both an environmental  as well as personal investigation into identity. The emphasis of the course will  be on learning to see and to develop one\u2019s own personal viewpoint.

Rappers shoot videos in art galleries. Biennials  proliferate, art fairs geographically expand, and auction sales hit new records. At the  same time, public arts funding is systematically slashed, emerging artists still struggle,  and art criticism remains in its perpetual crisis. The international contemporary art  world is a convoluted interplay of aesthetics and economics; ego and idealism. Berlin\u2019s  art world may be more production-based and experimental than the art scenes of other  major western cities, but it is still a microcosm of larger movements.  Through readings of art theory and criticism, discussions, site visits, guest speakers,  and short- and long-form response writing, this course offers an overview of the  conventions, trends, history, current developments and myriad structures and  substructures of the contemporary art world in general and Berlin\u2019s in particular. The  course delves into contemporary art\u2019s current prevailing discourse via methodological  analysis, practical observation, and input from professionals currently working in the  art\u2019s institutional and commercial sectors. It also offers a critical look at how these  larger art-world structures translate to Berlin.

The massive political, economic, and social changes the country has undergone since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 have dramatically altered the country\u2019s cultural landscape. In this seminar course, the course will survey the main development areas in Chinese contemporary art from the end of the 1920s to the present day. Dedicated to responding to the new textures of China\u2019s metropolitan culture, it will look at the relationship between visual arts, new media, architecture, and performance in the mega-city of Shanghai, often regarded as the cradle of Chinese modernity. The class will be complemented by guest lectures and visits to public museums, galleries and artists\u2019 studios in and around Shanghai. Students will have the opportunity to meet leading figures from the art world in China as well as the international art community, including artists, museum directors, curators, art critics, and art dealers.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.  Tours will alternate with classroom discussions and workshops.

The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century. Previous knowledge of art history, architecture, or German history is not required, but useful.

NYU Students who have already taken ARTH-UA 2 will not receive major credit for ARTH-UA 5 [Renaissance Art survey] or ARTH-UA 6 [Modern Art survey].   The city of Florence will be the classroom as students study the masters, explore museums, examine texts, and analyze the historical significance of monuments. With eyes cast simultaneously on painting, the graphic arts, sculpture, and architecture, this class will explore a broad range of art patronage that included religious and civic bodies, princely courts, and a growing number of private clients. The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making. Works will be examined on their native terms: both as physical objects, with sensitivity to their particular function and intended reception, and as visual images active within larger contexts.

Students in the Art History Dept: This course counts for Advanced Renaissance/Baroque credit.   This course is conceived as a focused study of the works of Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo, the men whose careers largely defined the concept of Western artistic genius. Particular consideration will also be given to their Florentine contemporaries and followers in order to take advantage of the opportunity to the study these original works on site. Renaissance art cannot be divorced from its times; thus, much attention will be given to contemporary history, especially Florentine politics and politics in Papal Rome. Special attention will also be given to the evolution of drawing practice in sixteenth-century Italy, an essential development for the changes that took place in the conception of works of art over the course of the century.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future. The course includes two site visits in Florence, one day-trip to the Venice Biennale, one day-trip to Rome.

London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.

It is an area in which there have been some remarkable successes in recent years both in America and in Europe: impressive and much loved public buildings have been given new life by progressive architects and developers, helping ensure that our towns and cities retain their individual character. Unlike international modern buildings, historic buildings are strong markers of the industry, aspirations, local materials and resources of a particular place. Recycling old buildings is crucial so our architectural and social history can be read in the townscape that surrounds us.   A course about recycling old buildings presents an opportunity to explore some basic themes in the built environment \u2013 architecture history, environmental issues and the rise of the conservation movement in the 19th and 20th centuries. Buildings are responsible for 50% of our carbon emissions each year, and more than half of a building\u2019s energy footprint is expended in the relatively short spell of its construction. Re-using our redundant historic architecture for new purposes has obvious positive benefits for the planet. Equally, upgrading historic buildings in use, like our housing stock, is environmentally smarter that demolishing parts of our cities and starting again with new structures.   The locations and nature of industrial production has changed across the world. Most western cities have a surfeit of industrial spaces and buildings lying empty, often in their centres. This course will first cover the story of the development of industrial architecture from the 18th century onwards and look at how these robust, proud and often highly decorative structures can accommodate new uses. Based in London, we will have the opportunity to visit a number of key examples of re-use where we can see first-hand how industrial history, modern technology and the changing use of our city centres combine to form this essential story in contemporary urbanism.

We will cover the types and definitions of museums, using key London collections, such as the British Museum and the Tate as well as smaller collections such as the Wallace Collection.   The course will introduce contemporary theories and practices in museology, examine how collections evolve, interrogate the role of individual collectors, study the specific character of the permanent and temporary exhibitions, and discuss the relationship between museums, cultures, and society. We will examine current issues in the museum profession as it faces the future of museums in the twenty-first century.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture.

This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art.

This course provides students with an overview of the theoretical traditions inspiring current research in international relations (IR). IR is a discipline which attempts to explain processes and events in world politics. Primarily emerging as a way to explain the behaviour of nation-states and their interactions, the discipline has expanded with the onset of globalization to explore an array of actors, institutions and processes which include but simultaneously transcend the nation-state.   The course will focus on the major theories of IR, and how theoretical debates inform key literature in major subfields of the discipline. The course is constructed in such a way as to familiarize students with core debates and cleavages in the field, for example between behavioural and ideological approaches to the study of world politics. There will also be a focus on some of the key substantive subfields of IR such as international organisations, humanitarian intervention, and global governance. Lastly, there will be ample opportunity for students to model international political behaviour through the application of rational choice and game theory. Students will be encouraged to use this as an opportunity to explore the efficacy of such approaches and their alternatives, to explaining the behaviour and actions of different actors in world politics.

Financial systems are centered on key institutions, instruments and markets. But they  also involve governments, public policy and regulation. They span the globe from the  US, the EU and Japan to Russia, China and the Emerging Markets. In critical ways,  country-level financial architectures are integrating to form a more seamless, high-performance whole. This is good for efficiency, innovation and growth, yet it also  amplifies problems during times of crisis   This course provides students with a broad and rigorous understanding of (i) How the  global financial system works and what purposes it serves, (ii) What the major elements  are and how they operate, and (iii) What challenges the global financial system creates  for public policy makers. In seeking to achieve these objectives, this broad-gauge  course provides a perspective that helps students understand and make the most of  their own professional opportunities. Along with a working knowledge of the global  macroeconomy, foundations of finance and corporate finance, this course will be  extremely helpful for students as a lens to focus on the key dimensions of the modern  business environment.

The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.

All other students should register under POL-UA 9530. For Non-BPE Stern, this course does not count for Stern credit, though Stern students are welcome to take this course as an elective.   Pre-requisites include successful completion of one of the following courses: (1) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) at the Square, (2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) at the Square, or (3) World Politics in London. A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.   NYU students at the Washington study away center will be primarily form the College of Arts and Science and the Stern School of Business BS in Business and Political Economy.

Despite conditions of economic and political oppression, Latin America has managed in recent years to forge a dynamically original cinema. After studying some European films that highlight the colonial background of current struggles in the world, we take a brief look at African cinema and then look closely at Latin American cinema, with films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Cuba. The emphasis throughout is on a common theme \u2013 the struggle against foreign domination and on the search for an authentic, innovative national cinematic style.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

Comparative   literature majors in track ii (literary and cultural studies) may count this   course toward one of their non-core major requirements.   The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                          Florence                                                    Topics in 20th Century Literature: The Two World Wars in Literature - COLIT-UA 9190 and  SASEM-UG 9202 - 4 points                               This course may be counted towards the Cultural Specialization and Elective requirement for Comp Lit majors, with prior DUS approval.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Our basic objective is to guide students into a more systematic approach to creative writing in any of the main genres, especially fiction and poetry. Each student is expected to engage in critical discussions on samples of their own writing as well as on writing by other members of the class. Our focus shall be on developing a grasp of the rudiments and general mechanics of the writer's craft, while at the same time allowing for a fuller realization of the personal/individual creative impulse and talent. Some class sessions will be devoted to various types of writing exercises, others to the discussion of sample texts, most of it produced by members of the class. Each student will be expected to share his/her work with the class and possibly with a wider audience when possible. At the end of the semester, each student will be expected to have produced a substantial body of creative writing for assessment by the course instructors.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

The course will first offer an overview of German theater traditions before 1900 and will then engage in analyzing specific developments in German theater starting with Max Reinhardt and his work at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Other case studies will focus on Brecht\u2019s epic theater, theater during the Third Reich, postwar theater trends in East and West Germany, and current developments in reunified Germany. Not only will we closely read relevant plays and theory by the theater makers of the respective periods but we will also explore aesthetics and performance issues as they have changed over time. As the involved practice of dramaturgy in Germany has greatly influenced theatrical developments, we will investigate this major aspect of theatrical work in Germany as a contribution to world theater and study how the extensive debate of ideas is being concretely realized in the theater through the choices being made in a production. An integral part of the course will include visits to Berlin theaters, attending performances, which we will analyze in class, and engaging in discussion with contemporary theater makers in Berlin.

Special attention will be given to the playhouses and the influence they had on the art of the theatre, actors' companies, and modes of production and performance. Lectures and discussions will focus on the aesthetic quality of the plays, their relationship with the audiences (then and now), the application of the diverse attitudes and assumptions of modern critical theory to the Elizabethan stage, the contrasting structures of Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean drama, the new emphasis on selfhood and individuality, and the major themes of hierarchy, order, and justice, the conflict of Nature and Fortune, the role of Providence, the ideals of love, and the norms of social accord. Opportunities will be given to investigate the interrelations of the plays and other arts, including film, opera, and ballet.

Far from scholarly chronological norms, we will use contemporary writings in order to better study their classical sources and inspirations. Theatre is an artistic discipline that is constantly in communication with its past. Theatre examines its roots in order to reorient and renew itself. Actors and directors reinvent the verses of Corneille, Moliere and Shakespeare so that they can better discover the writings of today. Dramaturgists reflect contemporary society, yet are always nourished by their predecessors so that they can either create a connection or break with them definitively. In this course we will examine great contemporary authors such as Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad, etc. As for the great classical figures, we will discuss such various authors as Sophocles, Corneille, Shakespeare and Racine. How did Jean-Paul Sartre use Corneille and Racine to give credence to his theatre? How was Cocteau or Giraudoux inspired by ancient theatre? What did Koltes take from classical tragedy in order to create his own dramas? This course will examine both theatrical writings as well as current productions in order to answer these questions. All the performances seen for the course as well as the works read will be discussed in oral presentations or written summaries. Conducted in French.

If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

Placing films in their historical and cultural context, we consider how cinema provides a window on French society, while recognizing that they are cultural products specific to a particular historical moment. Social history, cultural archetypes and artistic creation will be some of the topics under consideration. Conducted in English.

Prerequisites: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or Introduction to Economic Analysis (ECON-UA 5) or equivalents.   There are two parts to this course. In the first part of the course we will study two of the main financial asset markets: bond markets and stock markets. We will study the concept and determination of interest rates; the risk structure and the term structure of interest rates; stock pricing and the efficient markets hypothesis; cross-border arbitrage. We will also analyze financial structure in Argentina and other Latin American banks.   In the second part of the course we will study the monetary and financial system. We will study how money is created, the tools of monetary policy, the commercial banking industry and its links to monetary policy and the Central Bank, and how monetary policy affects the economy in general. In this part we will also analyze how market failures (such as information asymmetries) and distortionary policies (such as financial repression) may hinder the contribution of financial markets and monetary policy to macroeconomic stability. The roles of state-owned banks in Latin American economies will also be discussed.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

We offer a perspective on the workings of the monetary and financial system within a country and at an international level. The role of money and the tools to conduct monetary policy will be analyzed in detail. The concept of the value of money now and in the future helps in understanding the role of interest rates and of risk; various way to store wealth will take us into the structure of financial markets where financial instruments are created and traded to meet diverse needs. Some basic concepts on the role played by commercial banks will introduce the function of the Central Bank and of monetary policy in the overall goal of ensuring financial stability to the system. Current issues, such as the role of the European Central Bank and the instability created by the subprime mortgage crisis, will be discussed.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein And Dracula. This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.                                                                    Major British Writers - ENGL-UA 9060 - 4 points                               Most of these major texts from the canon of English literature have been selected because they open out onto life in London at the time they were written. We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels. Texts will be studied in chronological order; the course is weighted towards literature of the last 100 years. The Oxford Book of English Verse will help give us a sense of continuity and change.

The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.

This course carries an additional fee of $251 in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 to cover the cost of theatre tickets.   This course provides an introduction to the dramatic work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Students read and attend representative comedies, tragedies, and histories, their selection to be determined by the plays actually in production in and around London, particularly at the Barbican, New Globe, and Stratford to which at least one excursion will be made. Special attention will be given to the playhouses and the influence they had on the art of the theatre, actors' companies, and modes of production and performance. Lectures and discussions will focus on the aesthetic quality of the plays, their relationship with the audiences (then and now), the application of the diverse attitudes and assumptions of modern critical theory to the Elizabethan stage, the contrasting structures of Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean drama, the new emphasis on selfhood and individuality, and the major themes of hierarchy, order, and justice, the conflict of Nature and Fortune, the role of Providence, the ideals of love, and the norms of social accord. Opportunities will be given to investigate the interrelations of the plays and other arts, including film, opera, and ballet.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

It is about truth and truthiness and how to tell the difference. It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. The class will include a focus on the 2014 midterm elections. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course.

The course will address U.S. environmental policy through several lenses, including (1) a set of two introductory sessions in which students are introduced to key terminology, concepts, and orientations toward the domain of environmental policy; (2) a core series of fourteen sessions through which we survey how historical precedents have shaped contemporary U.S. environmental policies and programs; and (3) a concluding set of three sessions through which we review several unfolding environmental policy topics (e.g., climate change, invasive species, or hydraulic fracturing).   Sample syllabus                                                                      Globalizing Social Activism: Sustainable Development in Urban Areas - UPADM-GP 9217 or SCA-UA 9617 or ENVST-UA 9417 - 4 points                               For the first time in world history, the number of people living in urban areas exceeds the number of people living in rural areas. In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.

The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Far from scholarly chronological norms, we will use contemporary writings in order to better study their classical sources and inspirations. Theatre is an artistic discipline that is constantly in communication with its past. Theatre examines its roots in order to reorient and renew itself. Actors and directors reinvent the verses of Corneille, Moliere and Shakespeare so that they can better discover the writings of today. Dramaturgists reflect contemporary society, yet are always nourished by their predecessors so that they can either create a connection or break with them definitively. In this course we will examine great contemporary authors such as Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad, etc. As for the great classical figures, we will discuss such various authors as Sophocles, Corneille, Shakespeare and Racine. How did Jean-Paul Sartre use Corneille and Racine to give credence to his theatre? How was Cocteau or Giraudoux inspired by ancient theatre? What did Koltes take from classical tragedy in order to create his own dramas? This course will examine both theatrical writings as well as current productions in order to answer these questions. All the performances seen for the course as well as the works read will be discussed in oral presentations or written summaries. Conducted in French.                                                                    French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.

A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Problems in Contemporary French Society -\u00a0FREN-UA\u00a09965 - 4 points                               The course aims to introduce students to contemporary French society through an examination of particular social groups and categories, with a focus on French youth and notions of gender. Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course.

The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

(NYU, SPAN-UA 100 or equivalent)   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

This course will introduce students to the lifecycle of fashion, from forecasting fashion trends to the retailing and representation of vintage clothing, through design development, branding, buying and journalism. The course will also explore key issues for the sector \u2013 ethics, sustainability and the impact of the digital revolution. It will add a practical dimension to the NYU London triptych of fashion exploration, giving students unique access to studios and businesses working at the heart of London\u2019s vibrant fashion industry. Each session is structured to give students an overview of a particular stage in the fashion development process, through a mix of lectures from the course leader and visiting professionals, studio visits, walking tours, reading assignments and practical projects.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates.

This course will give you an overview of recent German political, social and cultural history after 1945 and of the present. Focuses will be on the variant developments in East and West Germany until the fall of the wall and on life in Berlin today. What are the important incidents and changes in German culture and society after 1945? How has the city of Berlin developed since the fall of the wall? These, and similar questions, will accompany us throughout the semester. During the course of the semester, we will explore narratives, which are related to our topics from a variety of genres: narrative prose, newspaper/magazine article, TV/radio documentary, music, film, photo, and other visual material. The class is entirely taught in German and emphasizes the language skills necessary to communicate effectively in a foreign language \u2013 speaking, reading, viewing, writing, and listening.

Anhand repr\u00e4sentativer Werke vermittelt er einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die verschiedenen Epochen und Gattungen, erste literaturwissenschaftliche Fachbegriffe werden erl\u00e4utert. Kontinuit\u00e4ten und Br\u00fcche, die als signifikante Entwicklungslinien oder Z\u00e4suren die Literaturgeschichte markieren, werden im historischen und gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang diskutiert. Der Kurs wird durchg\u00e4ngig in deutscher Sprache unterrichtet.  Es ist das Ziel, in gemeinsamen close readings a) ein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Texte und ihre politischen, kulturellen und sozialen Kontexte zu erarbeiten und b) die F\u00e4higkeit zur wissenschaftlichen Diskussion zu entwickeln. Gef\u00f6rdert wird dies auch durch kleinere spielerische Ein-heiten, in denen wir die Texte in die Gegenwart transferieren und so nach der Aktualit\u00e4t der Werke fragen.   The course provides an introduction into the history of German Literature from the 18th century until today. By reading representative texts, the student will receive an overview of various epochs and genres. In addition, basic terminology of literary studies will be explained. Continuities and disruptions, which influence the history of literature in significant ways, are discussed in their historical and social contexts. The class is taught entirely in German.  The course objectives are a) to develop an understanding of the texts and their political, cultural, and social contexts and b) to develop an ability of critical discussion through a close reading of literary works. This is also fostered by some playful teaching units, in which we transfer the texts into the present and investigate their current relevance.   Sample Syllabus                                                                        Topics in German Cinema - GERM-UA 9253 or SASEM-UG 9102 - 4 points                               Berlin is one of the most well-known film cities in the world. This course wants to introduce you to the study of German cinema by looking at changing images of the city since the postwar period. The course will begin with an introduction to film analysis, giving special attention to the relationship between film and city. We will go on to discuss a number of influential productions from East, West and reunified Germany, and draw comparisons to other German as well as non-German city films. Through seminar discussions, reading responses, and critical essays, you will gain an understanding of how the cinema has engaged with the city of Berlin and its transformations since the end of the Second World War.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      Berlin's Modern History &amp; Culture: A European Perspective - GERM-UA 9225 or HIST-UA 9984 or IDSEM-UG 9100 - 4 points                               Note: Students may not register for both this course and Comparative Modern Societies due to content overlap.   This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.     Sample Syllabus                                                                      German Intellectual Tradition: Marx, Nietzsche, Freud - GERM-UA 9240 or SOC-UA 9942 - 4 points                               NYU Sociology Students: This course counts as an advanced seminar   This interdisciplinary course examines the works of Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud, three  German speaking writers who pioneered radically different and influential interpretations  of modern life, which continue to shape our contemporary understanding of society and  individuality. The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Topics in 20th Century German Literature: Traditions of City Writing - GERM-UA.9298, SOC-UA.9435                               This course addresses literary, cultural, and theoretical representations of Berlin and other big European cities such as Dresden and Paris. Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    German Theater of the 20th Century: History & Practice - GERM-UA 9290 or THEA-UT 9612 - 4 points                               This course examines German theater of the twentieth century, from Expressionism to contemporary postdramatic forms of writing and performance. The course will first offer an overview of German theater traditions before 1900 and will then engage in analyzing specific developments in German theater starting with Max Reinhardt and his work at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Other case studies will focus on Brecht\u2019s epic theater, theater during the Third Reich, postwar theater trends in East and West Germany, and current developments in reunified Germany. Not only will we closely read relevant plays and theory by the theater makers of the respective periods but we will also explore aesthetics and performance issues as they have changed over time. As the involved practice of dramaturgy in Germany has greatly influenced theatrical developments, we will investigate this major aspect of theatrical work in Germany as a contribution to world theater and study how the extensive debate of ideas is being concretely realized in the theater through the choices being made in a production. An integral part of the course will include visits to Berlin theaters, attending performances, which we will analyze in class, and engaging in discussion with contemporary theater makers in Berlin.

To achieve the first two objectives, guest speakers will be invited to talk about specific topics, including the history, society and culture, religion, indigenous and contemporary health and political systems and their relevance in contemporary Ghana. These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

The overview investigates not only the country's experiments with authoritarianism - the experiences of mass murder, war and division - but also its emergence as a democratic leader, in the arts and human rights, and as Europe's power broker. We examine questions of citizenship and diversity, Germany's 'special' responsibility as a leader in Europe, the role of the Holocaust in State governance, Berlin's status and development as an industrial and cosmpolitan metropolis, and new avenues for German identity. We ask how these histories have made today's Berlin Europe's most exciting capital - a nexus of youth culture and the interational arts scene - and Germany a vanguard of the arts, sustainable energy, technical development and global politics.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.                              Prague                                                    Global Orientations: The Czech Republic in a Global Context                               The purpose of this class is primarily to discuss the history and culture of the Czech Republic and Central Europe\u2014the intersection of many international influences--in the context of globalization and, conversely, to discuss globalization in the local context. An important dimension of the class will be a discussion about how international students should use their experience abroad (in this case Prague and, more generally, Central Europe) to better understand complicated developments on the global level and back at home.   Taught by Dr. Jiri Pehe with a team of NYU Prague professors                            Sydney                                                    Global Orientations: Australian Society and Culture                               Australian society is replete with contradictions. Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Global Orientations: Israeli Society and Culture                               This course is designed to help you understand contemporary Israel \u2013 the society, its problems and its pre-occupations. Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.

Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC. Students will consider the current state of affairs and be challenged to imagine how the future might be different. Respectful, factual, passionate and influential dialogue will be encouraged and expected.

It is intimately related to public health and policy making, as it provides elemental \u201cinformation for action\u201d. This course is designed to introduce students to the history, basic principles and methods of epidemiology.     Topics covered in this course are history, background and different perspectives of epidemiology, measures of disease frequency; measures of association; epidemiologic study designs; public health surveillance; outbreak investigations; assessment of causality; and relationship between epidemiology and public health policies. In addition, students are expected to develop skills to critically read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiological studies and mass media sources.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Public Intellectuals: Dissent and Direction in Europe - HIST-UA 9249 - 4 points                               Public intellectuals have an important role to play in society: they are supposed to speak the  truth. They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

In the eighteenth century, Britain prided itself on the liberty enjoyed by its people, yet it was the largest participant in the Atlantic slave trade, and grew rich on the wealth created by ports such as London, Bristol and Liverpool. In the same period some 15,000 black people lived in English ports and their presence has only recently been properly acknowledged. In the nineteenth century, however, Britain perceived itself as in the forefront of the global battle to end the slave trade and slavery itself. This pioneering campaign contributed to a more positive sense of British national identity. Yet Britain continued to depend on the importation of slave-grown produce and even began to ship hundreds of thousands of Indians as virtual slaves to many parts of the world. The ambivalent legacy of Britain\u2019s past involvement with slavery remains important to Britain's multi-cultural identity and its global role today.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification.

This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. As a special focus, we will examine the significance of the liberalization of the airwaves in emerging democracies such as Ghana.

This course carries an additional fee of $340 in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 to cover the cost of theatre tickets. Students should also be prepared to pay up to \u00a3100 or $150 for extra tickets while in London as part of the Methods &amp; Practice course.     Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

The course proceeds by the reading and analysis of contemporary journalism and classic travel pieces: careful examination of the narrative; fictional and literary devices used in travel writing; examination of and practice with various information gathering strategies; consideration of the ethics of representation. Students will continually develop stories from their own travel experiences for presentation and in-depth critique in class. These regular assignments will prepare students for their final project: a substantial travel narrative of their own. Participants must meet deadlines set for assignments. Participants may not submit previously published or completed work for the assignments.

Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

It is about truth and truthiness and how to tell the difference. It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. The class will include a focus on the 2014 midterm elections. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

We will consider how to compare American and Chinese governance systems, and whether and how concepts can be translated between them\u2014so that the countries, and their citizens can learn from, and cooperate with, one another. In the process, we hope to learn about China, but also to reflect\u2014in the light of 9/11 and Iraq-- more deeply on our own understanding of how American governance works\u2014and how it is seen by the world.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

The course examines Advertising not only as an academic discipline, but also a way of perceiving and understanding our society.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Social Media Networking - MCC-UE 9032 - 4 points                               This course will examine \u201csocial media\u201d from a cultural perspective, with a focus on how media technologies figure in practices of everyday life and in the construction of social relationships and identities. Although many of our readings will deal with Social Network Sites (SNSs), we will attempt to form an expansive definition of what constitutes \u201csocial media.\u201d We will also work from an expansive definition of \u201ctechnology,\u201d considering the term in a cultural sense to include various practices and tools used to communicate in everyday life.   Sample syllabus                                                                      Media and Cultural Analysis -\u00a0MCC-UE 9014 - 4 points                               An introduction to the theoretical approaches and practices used to analyze the content, structure, and context of media in society. Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Global Media Seminar: East-Central Europe - JOUR-UA 9505 and MCC-UE 9453 - 4 points                               The idea of the course is to inform students about European media in general, and about transformation of the Czech media after the Velvet revolution in 1989 in particular. Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

The interpretative classes will run concurrently with production management, sights and sound, and post-production workshops. The course will have three objectives: (1) teach students the documentary tradition from Flaherty to Rouch; (2) use critical Cinema theory to define a document with a camera; and (3) create a short documentary film.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Global Connections: Accra - SCA-UA\u00a09634 - 4 points                               Counter to the prevailing view of a rural African living in traditional communities, the majority of Africans are rapidly becoming urban dwellers. African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.     Sample Syllabus                            Berlin                                                    Environmental Social Movements - ENVST-UA 9481 or SOC-UA 9209 - 4 points                               How do social movements form in response to environmental concerns? What makes them effective or ineffective? This course analyses the various social movements that organized in response to environmental concerns. Both historical and sociological dimensions of environmental movements are covered, with particular attention given to how issues of environmental protection and social justice intersect. At NYU Berlin, the course includes American (I), European, and in particular German (II), as well as global movements (III).                                                                        Global Connections: Berlin Trends - SCA-UA 9634 - 4 points                               This course examines diverse current urban trends in Berlin and their connections to  worldwide phenomena. It focuses on the way that different social groups (according to  class, milieu, origin, gender or sexuality) appropriate urban space and constitute  place-specific identities.  It uses the city of Berlin with its multiple layers of history as a laboratory for  contemporary urban research with historical, empirical and theoretical material. We will  study key debates on urban developments, partly as field visits, in regard to housing,  migration, gentrification, and we will search for the creative and the sustainable city.  You will be introduced to the contemporary discourses on those trends and to new  ways of reading and seeing a city.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Argentine Civil Society. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency. The course provides you with tools to analyze your organization\u2019s approach, its policies, its programs, and the political, legal, social, economic and cultural contexts in which it operates. Guest-speakers are invited to the seminar and case studies on Argentina civil society are discussed.&amp;nbsp; You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

More than 30 years have passed since 1979, the year when a self-styled Islamic Revolution unfolded in Iran. Historian Eric J. Hobsbawm branded this revolution as &quot;one of the central social revolutions of the twentieth century&quot;; and social scientist Richard Cottam described it as perhaps &quot;the most popular revolution in the history of mankind.&quot; Whatever the case may be, we are now permitted to use the benefit of hindsight to revisit the 1979 revolution. In the first part of the course we will review the manifold causes of the 1979 revolution in a historical perspective, tracing the social, political, economic and cultural bases of the rise of the revolutionary movement and political Islam (or Islamism) in Iran. We will then move on to situate the revolution in a global context. This will enable us to examine Iranian history since 1979 in comparative perspective as well as to integrate the revolution into the &quot;entangled histories&quot; of modernity of which it is part. At the same time we will examine the cultural dimensions of the post-1979 state in Iran. We will consider cultural production in the Islamic Republic of Iran as a site of state domination and oppositional resistance. We will suggest that the Islamic Republic is a &quot;scopic regime,&quot; developing a symbolic Islamism as a tool of propaganda and hegemony. At the same time, literature, cinema, and the visual arts have been sites of resistance.

The approach is multidisciplinary and aims at a comprehensive survey of the music theatre in the context of the Italian cultural heritage. Literary sources, musico-dramatic features, vocal styles are studied in connection with major works that best represent trends and genres in the Italian operatic tradition. Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

The two weekly class sessions will be devoted to group work in  sight-singing and dictation: melodic, rhythmic and harmonic -- and in listening to longer  segments of work to sharpen your perception of musical form. You will be expected to  keep up a regular practice of these skills outside of class. In addition, we will arrange  tutorials (at least three per semester) for individual work and assessment.    The musical materials of AC III will be taken mostly from 19th-century sources,  reinforcing your work in Music Theory and Music History III. We will also work with  more chromatic music of the 18th century, as well as jazz, popular music and relevant  world cultures.

We will go through harmonic instances of advanced chromaticism of the late 19. century and up to the very edge of tonality. Emphasis will be put on assignments and exercises in order to develop good creative and analytical  skills in harmony. Concurrently we will examine the main formal principles of tonal music and apply  our knowledge in analysis of selected compositions. We will use various analytical approaches and  test them on a large scale of historical musical material. Every student will be due to realize at least one analysis of assigned composition during the semester.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.

Our exploration of political theory will proceed from a  close reading and analysis of seminal texts that are presented both conceptually and,  for the most part, chronologically. The primary focus will be placed on examining the  historical antecedents of some of the foundational concepts and practices that  distinguish our political behavior and institutions today. While taking account of the  historical complexities and stylized conventions of each text, the course will highlight  the recurrent themes that animate these influential writings and continue to shape our  contemporary understanding of politics. In particular, the lectures and discussions will  be geared towards tracing the conceptual underpinnings of current forms of political  organization, such as the nation-state and liberal democracy, and their effects on the  concerns of law, justice and morality. Some of the critical issues to be discussed  include the divergent views of human nature and ideal society, the structure of  authority and sovereignty, states of emergency, the defense of liberty, equality and  justice, and the different models of democratic practice.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

Sample Syllabus                                                                    Comparative Politics- POL-UA 9500- 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of comparative politics, which is defined as the study of domestic politics anywhere in the world. As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

Characteristics and conditions of war and peace and the transition from one to the other from the perspective of political and social science. Examines the role and use of coercion in global affairs, with emphasis on attempts to substitute negotiation, bargaining, market forces, politics, and law for the resort to massive violence in moderating disputes. Considers recent developments in both the theory and practice of peacebuilding demonstrating the differing ways in which particular conflicts tend to be viewed by participants, external commentators and policy-makers. Students will also undertake their own research on a case study of conflict.   The course will be taught in the form of an informal lecture and a class discussion, and students will present preliminary versions of their case studies to the class. A visiting speaker from an organisation dealing with issues of violent conflict and peace will also participate in one of the sessions (to be arranged).

A study of Spain and its integration into the European Common Market. The historical background examines Europe in the aftermath of World War II, Spain under Franco's dictatorship and its relationship to other European countries, as well as the events leading up to the actual foundation of the European Economic Community (EEC). Emphasis is on the negotiations leading to Spain's incorporation into the EEC, and a detailed analysis is given of the present-day European Common Market and its goals for the future.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.

Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.

Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      East European Government and\u00a0Politics - POL-UA 9522 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the modern politics and government of Central and Eastern Europe from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to the present. We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.

The first part examines competing approaches to international politics, explains their basic concepts and rationales, and evaluates their explanatory insights. The principal objective of this part is for students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which various theoretical perspectives lead to different understandings of the structures and practices of world politics. The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Diplomacy &amp; Negotiation: Conflict Resolution in the Middle East - POL-UA 9720 - 4 points                               International negotiation has become the most widely used means of conflict management in international affairs. Negotiations of international significance are today conducted not only between individual states, but also within and beyond them. At the same time negotiation practice itself is undergoing much change with changing patterns of conflict and intervention, new urgent issues on the global agenda, new actors and new emerging norms.   This course provides an overview of negotiation and conflict resolution theories and practices of international importance \u2013 bilateral, regional and multilateral. The emphasis is on different approaches/aspects to understanding what drives the negotiation process and explains the outcome. Why do some negotiations succeed, while others keep failing? Why do some peace settlements succeed while others fail? We will examine not only the official negotiation process but also the important functions of pre-negotiation, second-track diplomacy and post-agreement negotiations concerned with implementation and compliance.   While we will give many examples from various civil and international conflicts, our main focus will be on two regional conflicts \u2013 Cyprus and the Arab-Israeli conflict. There will also be guest lectures by some of those who were involved in peace negotiations in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - POL-UA 9994 or RELST-UA 9613\u00a0or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.   Sample Syllabus                          Washington, DC                                                  American Public Opinion &amp; Pressure Groups - POL-UA 9342 - 4 points                               While not required at NYU Washington, DC, we strongly recommend that students take POL-UA 300 - Power and Politics in America prior to enrolling in this course.   This class will examine the origins of public opinion research, the impact it has on news coverage, political campaigns, public discourse, elected officials, and in many cases, public policy outcomes. You will learn how to read, analyze, and critically-evaluate public opinion research; you will learn about \u201cleading\u201d and \u201ctrailing\u201d research indicators; and you will learn why \u201ccharacter\u201d attributes often matter more than \u201cperformance\u201d attributes and issue position. You will see how political campaigns, lobbyists, public relations professionals and others leverage public opinion to impact perceptions and political, policy and business outcomes. And because this course is being taught in the nation\u2019s capital, where politics and policy converge--and against the backdrop of a close and hard-fought presidential campaign\u2014we will also hear from political professionals from both political parties, congressional staffers, and journalists, who will share their insights about how they apply public opinion research to conduct campaigns, shape policy, report the news, or address business challenges.   There is an existing and established core reading list for this course, which we will use as the foundational reading for the course. Each week\u2019s lecture topic will cover the assigned reading topics and apply them to real-life examples, so that they can be more easily and clearly understood. Young people often tell me how much they enjoy politics, and sometimes ask whether it\u2019s possible for them to make a career doing politics, and what is the best way to make it happen. If you are one of those young people, this course is designed to help show you how to do it.   Classes will begin with a discussion of the reading assignment, and how it might apply to a specific aspect of public opinion research. Following the discussion on the core materials, we will analyze and discuss a political or issue poll (including tracking and other polling from the previous week, since this is the campaign season and there will be many public opinion research instruments released during the semester), and/or a guest lecturer, who could be a public opinion researcher, a campaign operative, a congressional or committee staffer, or a member of the national news media who covers campaigns.

All other students should register under POL-UA 9530. For Non-BPE Stern, this course does not count for Stern credit, though Stern students are welcome to take this course as an elective.   Pre-requisites include successful completion of one of the following courses: (1) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) at the Square, (2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) at the Square, or (3) World Politics in London. A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.

Effective leadership plays an integral role in bridging communities that historically were separate, but today exist side-by-side in a culture that is religiously and spiritually diverse. This course seeks to prepare students to become aware of faith traditions other than their own, with a strong emphasis on learning techniques and theories of how to engage others. We will look at different theories of religions, current examples of leadership and communities, influence of media, and movements around social justice and service in hopes of laying a foundation for solid connections across religious communities.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.

Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.

Sydney                                                  The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

The course will focus on the current realities and future possibilities of global higher education at the backdrop of its historical and conceptual coordinates. A glance at the con-temporary higher education landscape reveals ambivalent trends and directions: Excellence and internationalization protrude as paradigms that drive universities to secure their stakes in the global higher education market. National politics of education further enhance this competition among institutional front-runners by launching excellence initiatives or entering in supranational Bologna-type arrangements to facilitate cross-border academic exchange and knowledge production. Hence a range of distinct regional approaches to global education have emerged from national models and practices of education.    This course will serve as a site of academic dialogue between NYU and HU students in one classroom by pursuing the following three steps. First, it seeks to familiarize its participants with the visions and promises of global education while also paying attention to potential perils involved in globalizing national models of education. Among others, we will address questions such as: How are modes of producing and disseminating knowledge affected when education crosses borders? What does global education demand from student learners and how are globally educated citizens envisioned? How can experiences of knowledge production and education specific to one context be made operable in another? In a second step, the course introduces and compares regional approaches to global education. Different national histories of higher education yield different answers to the questions formulated in the first step. Yet, debates center around (one) global education, not educations. This tension requires scrutiny and, in a third step, it will ask students to develop an informed and critical position on the stakes of global education.  In order to make use of the unique classroom setting the course will employ independent (out-of-class) and in-class, individual and collective, analytical and interpretive formats. Students will be particularly encouraged to fully embrace the learning impulses resulting from the inter-cultural encounter between NYU and Humboldt students. The language we are going to acquire in this course is called global education. By starting to learn its rules and formulas, students are likely to see possible future trajectories of educational development and might even envision their future role in it. The class work will culminate in a colloquium at which both NYU and HU students will present their final group projects.

NYU Sociology Students: This course counts as an advanced seminar.   The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century. Previous knowledge of art history, architecture, or German history is not required, but useful.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Politics, Power and Society: The Politics of the European Union - EURO-UA 9471 or POL-UA 9471 or SOC-UA 9471 - 4 points                               This course aims to provide an overview of the history, structure, functions, processes  and current issues of European integration with a particular emphasis on the role of  Germany both as to its influence on the EU and the Europeanisation of its own political  system.  European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - POL-UA 9994 or RELST-UA 9613\u00a0or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.

After completing this course, students who wish to continue studying Spanish must take a qualifying examination. Students who pass the examination may go into SPAN-UA 3, which is preparation for SPAN-UA 4. Students with high scores on the qualifying exam may enroll in SPAN-UA 18 (an accelerated version of SPAN-UA 3, which similarly prepares them for SPAN-UA 4) or in SPAN-UA 20. Completion of either SPAN-UA 20 or SPAN-UA 4 fulfills the MAP requirement.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

(NYU, SPAN-UA 100 or equivalent)   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

Introduction to literary analysis through close reading of texts from the early to modern periods of peninsular Spanish and Spanish American literatures. Engages students in the practice of textual explication, provides basic critical skills, and encourages reflection on literature as a system. This course is the gateway course for students interested in pursuing advanced literature courses in Spanish. With very few exceptions, students must have completed Critical Approaches before taking advanced literature courses taught in Spanish.

Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Literatura Y Terror - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.   Este curso se propone discutir y examinar diferentes formas en que el terror aparece y se despliega en la literatura rioplatense (mayormente en Argentina, aunque tambi\u00e9n incluye algunos escritores del Uruguay) desde mediados del siglo XIX hasta la actualidad. El terror es uno de los elementos constitutivos de la literatura y la cultura rioplatense pr\u00e1cticamente desde sus or\u00edgenes. En varios de sus textos considerados \u201cfundacionales\u201d, el terror, vinculado directamente con ciertas pr\u00e1cticas pol\u00edticas, es motivo de reflexi\u00f3n al mismo tiempo que se vuelve un eje alrededor del cual se organiza la escritura. Pero ese inter\u00e9s por el terror se manifiesta no s\u00f3lo a trav\u00e9s del an\u00e1lisis pol\u00edtico, filos\u00f3fico o hist\u00f3rico de la cuesti\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n a partir de un tratamiento literario que parece exhibir mejor que cualquier an\u00e1lisis la esencia y el funcionamiento del terror. Por eso la presencia del terror en los inicios de la literatura rioplatense tambi\u00e9n puede y debe analizarse teniendo en cuenta otra perspectiva: la del terror en tanto g\u00e9nero o modo de lo literario, derivado directo de la narrativa g\u00f3tica que surge en Europa en la segunda mitad del siglo XVIII. Ese cruce entre terror pol\u00edtico y terror literario es una marca que est\u00e1 en el origen de la literatura rioplatense y que va a perdurar, con algunas variantes, hasta la actualidad.    El prop\u00f3sito del curso es partir del repaso de algunas definiciones y conceptos vinculados con el \u201cterror\u201d, para luego hacer un an\u00e1lisis de diferentes textos de la literatura rioplatense, desde los inicios, en los que es perceptible claramente el cruce entre pol\u00edtica, literatura y terror, pasando por otros momentos en los que esa relaci\u00f3n se resignifica y el terror toma formas diversas, pero sin abandonar ese cruce fundacional.

(NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   This course deals with themes of culture, cultural identity and the politics of culture and identity, with reference to five specific Latin American cases: a). Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Latin American Studies - SPAN-UA 9760 - 4 points                               Please note Intro to Latin American Studies is no longer offered under SPAN-UA 9762 with Spanish instruction/assignments. This course is now taught in English only.     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the most important problems and debates about Latin American history, society and culture. Latin America is a complex region full of contrasts. Its population is both racially and culturally heterogeneous. Its many countries share some common cultural roots and political origins, but also have distinct histories. The structure of this course is primarily chronological but also thematic. We will start with the Conquest and its legacies and we will end with the problems that we experience today in big cities in Latin America. The course favors a multi-disciplinary approach, and therefore we will use a different array of materials including films, letters, photographs and essays. We will emphasize first hand accounts of the topics we discuss.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Borges and Argentine Literature -\u00a0SPAN-UA\u00a09845 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.     The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

Despite conditions of economic and political oppression, Latin America has managed in recent years to forge a dynamically original cinema. After studying some European films that highlight the colonial background of current struggles in the world, we take a brief look at African cinema and then look closely at Latin American cinema, with films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Cuba. The emphasis throughout is on a common theme \u2013 the struggle against foreign domination and on the search for an authentic, innovative national cinematic style.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

It considers both traditional aspects of life and how people live their lives in this first decade of the new millennium. How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class. There will be a written examination at the end of the semester and a dissertation on an aspect of Ghanaian society and culture that students might choose to explore.

Comparative   literature majors in track ii (literary and cultural studies) may count this   course toward one of their non-core major requirements.   The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Intensive Twi Language Course -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a0GHAN.002 - 4 points                               This is a language course designed to provide basic communicative competence in oral and written Twi for beginners.

The languages covered include Swahili (East Africa), Hausa and Yoruba (Nigeria and West Africa), Xhosa (Southern Africa), and Somali (Horn of Africa). The literature is discussed largely according to major genre types, such as poetry and song, oral narratives, and written prose literature. No knowledge of these languages is required for the course.                                                                    Perspectives on African Experience - SCA-UA 9789 - 4 points                               The course familiarizes students with a selection of the varying perspectives from which African experience has been perceived, analyzed, and interpreted, primarily by Africans and persons of African descent, both on the continent and in the diaspora.                                                                    Language in Africa -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09911 - 4 points                               An introduction to thinking about the human faculty of language within a specifically African context. The course focuses on issues of language within the framework of human society at all levels, and not so much on language as a structural entity. Topics include the general characteristics of human language; the description of the languages of Africa; the question of language and cultural contact in Africa; and the contemporary issues of language and sociopolitics in Africa.                                                                    Contemporary African Literature -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09912 - 4 points                               The course examines not only the common concerns but also the diverse traditions, as a result of historical, social, and cultural imperatives, that have informed the literature produced by African writers. Topics include colonialism; the question of language; race and identity; nationalism and literature; modernity; exile; and the politics of gender in the African context.                                                                    Culture in Africa - SCA-UA 9913 - 4 points                               The aim of the course is to introduce students to cultural dimensions in Africa, and to ways of approaching the study of culture in Africa. It focuses on three overall themes: orality, performance and identity, exploring ways in which these find expression primarily (though not exclusively) through language, religious belief, music, literature, nationalism, and popular culture. After presenting a general theoretical framework for the study of the themes, it concentrates on specific cultural contexts, illustrated with &quot;case studies&quot;. Students are also encouraged to do further reading within other culture areas of Africa and the African Diaspora.

The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

Rappers shoot videos in art galleries. Biennials  proliferate, art fairs geographically expand, and auction sales hit new records. At the  same time, public arts funding is systematically slashed, emerging artists still struggle,  and art criticism remains in its perpetual crisis. The international contemporary art  world is a convoluted interplay of aesthetics and economics; ego and idealism. Berlin\u2019s  art world may be more production-based and experimental than the art scenes of other  major western cities, but it is still a microcosm of larger movements.  Through readings of art theory and criticism, discussions, site visits, guest speakers,  and short- and long-form response writing, this course offers an overview of the  conventions, trends, history, current developments and myriad structures and  substructures of the contemporary art world in general and Berlin\u2019s in particular. The  course delves into contemporary art\u2019s current prevailing discourse via methodological  analysis, practical observation, and input from professionals currently working in the  art\u2019s institutional and commercial sectors. It also offers a critical look at how these  larger art-world structures translate to Berlin.

In this seminar course, the course will survey the main development areas in Chinese contemporary art from the end of the 1920s to the present day. Dedicated to responding to the new textures of China\u2019s metropolitan culture, it will look at the relationship between visual arts, new media, architecture, and performance in the mega-city of Shanghai, often regarded as the cradle of Chinese modernity. The class will be complemented by guest lectures and visits to public museums, galleries and artists\u2019 studios in and around Shanghai. Students will have the opportunity to meet leading figures from the art world in China as well as the international art community, including artists, museum directors, curators, art critics, and art dealers.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.

With eyes cast simultaneously on painting, the graphic arts, sculpture, and architecture, this class will explore a broad range of art patronage that included religious and civic bodies, princely courts, and a growing number of private clients. The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making. Works will be examined on their native terms: both as physical objects, with sensitivity to their particular function and intended reception, and as visual images active within larger contexts.

Students in the Art History Dept: This course counts for Advanced Renaissance/Baroque credit.   This course is conceived as a focused study of the works of Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo, the men whose careers largely defined the concept of Western artistic genius. Particular consideration will also be given to their Florentine contemporaries and followers in order to take advantage of the opportunity to the study these original works on site. Renaissance art cannot be divorced from its times; thus, much attention will be given to contemporary history, especially Florentine politics and politics in Papal Rome. Special attention will also be given to the evolution of drawing practice in sixteenth-century Italy, an essential development for the changes that took place in the conception of works of art over the course of the century.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future. The course includes two site visits in Florence, one day-trip to the Venice Biennale, one day-trip to Rome.

London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.

It is an area in which there have been some remarkable successes in recent years both in America and in Europe: impressive and much loved public buildings have been given new life by progressive architects and developers, helping ensure that our towns and cities retain their individual character. Unlike international modern buildings, historic buildings are strong markers of the industry, aspirations, local materials and resources of a particular place. Recycling old buildings is crucial so our architectural and social history can be read in the townscape that surrounds us.   A course about recycling old buildings presents an opportunity to explore some basic themes in the built environment \u2013 architecture history, environmental issues and the rise of the conservation movement in the 19th and 20th centuries. Buildings are responsible for 50% of our carbon emissions each year, and more than half of a building\u2019s energy footprint is expended in the relatively short spell of its construction. Re-using our redundant historic architecture for new purposes has obvious positive benefits for the planet. Equally, upgrading historic buildings in use, like our housing stock, is environmentally smarter that demolishing parts of our cities and starting again with new structures.   The locations and nature of industrial production has changed across the world. Most western cities have a surfeit of industrial spaces and buildings lying empty, often in their centres. This course will first cover the story of the development of industrial architecture from the 18th century onwards and look at how these robust, proud and often highly decorative structures can accommodate new uses. Based in London, we will have the opportunity to visit a number of key examples of re-use where we can see first-hand how industrial history, modern technology and the changing use of our city centres combine to form this essential story in contemporary urbanism.

We will cover the types and definitions of museums, using key London collections, such as the British Museum and the Tate as well as smaller collections such as the Wallace Collection.   The course will introduce contemporary theories and practices in museology, examine how collections evolve, interrogate the role of individual collectors, study the specific character of the permanent and temporary exhibitions, and discuss the relationship between museums, cultures, and society. We will examine current issues in the museum profession as it faces the future of museums in the twenty-first century.

The course moves from the Merovingians of the 5th century to late Gothic of the 16th to help students gain an understanding of medieval France through an analysis of monuments in their historic and cultural contexts. From the portals of Notre-Dame of Paris to the collections of the Mus\u00e9e de Cluny, we will seek to decode the symbolic language of medieval sculpture and architecture. Pairing texts and monuments, we will consider the writings of authors such as the Abbot Suger as we inspect his church of Saint-Denis, or as we study liturgical objects in the collections of the Louvre. Throughout the course we will consider how visual art during the Middles Ages helped shape cultural identity and express the political and religious agendas of the age. The course ends with a study of E.E. Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s work during the 19th century, together with his legacy and role in constructing our notions of medieval art and architecture.

This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

This course provides students with an overview of the theoretical traditions inspiring current research in international relations (IR). IR is a discipline which attempts to explain processes and events in world politics. Primarily emerging as a way to explain the behaviour of nation-states and their interactions, the discipline has expanded with the onset of globalization to explore an array of actors, institutions and processes which include but simultaneously transcend the nation-state.   The course will focus on the major theories of IR, and how theoretical debates inform key literature in major subfields of the discipline. The course is constructed in such a way as to familiarize students with core debates and cleavages in the field, for example between behavioural and ideological approaches to the study of world politics. There will also be a focus on some of the key substantive subfields of IR such as international organisations, humanitarian intervention, and global governance.

Financial systems are centered on key institutions, instruments and markets. But they  also involve governments, public policy and regulation. They span the globe from the  US, the EU and Japan to Russia, China and the Emerging Markets. In critical ways,  country-level financial architectures are integrating to form a more seamless, high-performance whole. This is good for efficiency, innovation and growth, yet it also  amplifies problems during times of crisis   This course provides students with a broad and rigorous understanding of (i) How the  global financial system works and what purposes it serves, (ii) What the major elements  are and how they operate, and (iii) What challenges the global financial system creates  for public policy makers. In seeking to achieve these objectives, this broad-gauge  course provides a perspective that helps students understand and make the most of  their own professional opportunities. Along with a working knowledge of the global  macroeconomy, foundations of finance and corporate finance, this course will be  extremely helpful for students as a lens to focus on the key dimensions of the modern  business environment.

The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.

More novel still is the opportunity to receive instruction in child and adolescent psychopathology from practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists and psychologists. Through seminars and discussions, this course will focus on disease etiology, epidemiology, phenomenology, nosology, and diagnosis. It engages students in a critical review of common child and adolescent psychopathology and challenges social and cultural assumptions of what constitutes &quot;normal&quot; versus &quot;pathological&quot; behaviour, cognition, and emotion. Students also complete one practicum by participating with a psychiatrist during the evaluation of a child or adolescent patient.

Despite conditions of economic and political oppression, Latin America has managed in recent years to forge a dynamically original cinema. After studying some European films that highlight the colonial background of current struggles in the world, we take a brief look at African cinema and then look closely at Latin American cinema, with films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Cuba. The emphasis throughout is on a common theme \u2013 the struggle against foreign domination and on the search for an authentic, innovative national cinematic style.

Over the last 50 years, millions of Latin Americans have experienced extraordinary shifts in their social, political, and cultural landscape, a result of the transformative effects of revolution or insurgency, state repression, popular resistance and social movements. We focus on events that had continental, hemispheric, and even global impact, including the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the military coups of the 1970s, and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. Drawing on a range of primary sources and cultural forms, we listen carefully to the voices of the major social actors of the time. Our sources are drawn from a wide range of media: newsprint, television broadcasts, transcripts, testimony, essay, documentary and feature film, art, and music. We deliberately mix artistic representations with documentary evidence to understand how the arts\u2014music, visual art, literature, film\u2014do not just reflect the reality around them, but are themselves vital sites for shaping and changing that reality and our imagination of it, both then and now.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                          Florence                                                    Topics in 20th Century Literature: The Two World Wars in Literature - COLIT-UA 9190 and  SASEM-UG 9202 - 4 points                               This course may be counted towards the Cultural Specialization and Elective requirement for Comp Lit majors, with prior DUS approval.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

The course will first offer an overview of German theater traditions before 1900 and will then engage in analyzing specific developments in German theater starting with Max Reinhardt and his work at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Other case studies will focus on Brecht\u2019s epic theater, theater during the Third Reich, postwar theater trends in East and West Germany, and current developments in reunified Germany. Not only will we closely read relevant plays and theory by the theater makers of the respective periods but we will also explore aesthetics and performance issues as they have changed over time. As the involved practice of dramaturgy in Germany has greatly influenced theatrical developments, we will investigate this major aspect of theatrical work in Germany as a contribution to world theater and study how the extensive debate of ideas is being concretely realized in the theater through the choices being made in a production. An integral part of the course will include visits to Berlin theaters, attending performances, which we will analyze in class, and engaging in discussion with contemporary theater makers in Berlin.

Far from scholarly chronological norms, we will use contemporary writings in order to better study their classical sources and inspirations. Theatre is an artistic discipline that is constantly in communication with its past. Theatre examines its roots in order to reorient and renew itself. Actors and directors reinvent the verses of Corneille, Moliere and Shakespeare so that they can better discover the writings of today. Dramaturgists reflect contemporary society, yet are always nourished by their predecessors so that they can either create a connection or break with them definitively. In this course we will examine great contemporary authors such as Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad, etc. As for the great classical figures, we will discuss such various authors as Sophocles, Corneille, Shakespeare and Racine. How did Jean-Paul Sartre use Corneille and Racine to give credence to his theatre? How was Cocteau or Giraudoux inspired by ancient theatre? What did Koltes take from classical tragedy in order to create his own dramas? This course will examine both theatrical writings as well as current productions in order to answer these questions. All the performances seen for the course as well as the works read will be discussed in oral presentations or written summaries.

If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein And Dracula. This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.                                                                    Major British Writers - ENGL-UA 9060 - 4 points                               Most of these major texts from the canon of English literature have been selected because they open out onto life in London at the time they were written. We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels. Texts will be studied in chronological order; the course is weighted towards literature of the last 100 years. The Oxford Book of English Verse will help give us a sense of continuity and change.

The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.

This course carries an additional fee of $251 in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 to cover the cost of theatre tickets.   This course provides an introduction to the dramatic work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Students read and attend representative comedies, tragedies, and histories, their selection to be determined by the plays actually in production in and around London, particularly at the Barbican, New Globe, and Stratford to which at least one excursion will be made. Special attention will be given to the playhouses and the influence they had on the art of the theatre, actors' companies, and modes of production and performance. Lectures and discussions will focus on the aesthetic quality of the plays, their relationship with the audiences (then and now), the application of the diverse attitudes and assumptions of modern critical theory to the Elizabethan stage, the contrasting structures of Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean drama, the new emphasis on selfhood and individuality, and the major themes of hierarchy, order, and justice, the conflict of Nature and Fortune, the role of Providence, the ideals of love, and the norms of social accord. Opportunities will be given to investigate the interrelations of the plays and other arts, including film, opera, and ballet.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

What makes them effective or ineffective? This course analyses the various social movements that organized in response to environmental concerns. Both historical and sociological dimensions of environmental movements are covered, with particular attention given to how issues of environmental protection and social justice intersect. At NYU Berlin, the course includes American (I), European, and in particular German (II), as well as global movements (III).

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

It is about truth and truthiness and how to tell the difference. It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. The class will include a focus on the 2014 midterm elections. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.   Sample syllabus                                                                    The Political Economy of Europe from a Global Perspective - EURO-UA 9294 - 4 points                               The overriding goal of this course is to reach an understanding of the key strategic issues facing Europe today and how they impact on the political economy of the region. We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.

Our course explores the dramatic evolution of French art across 200 tumultuous years, from its classical origins under Louis XIII and Louis XIV's Old Regime, through its transformations across the Enlightenment period, to its radical Neo-Classical revision during the French Revolution, and Romantic reconstruction at the demise of the Napoleonic era and Bourbon Restoration, ending with the 1830 Revolution. Through analysis of the reciprocity between artists and the political-cultural institutions of Paris, we examine the ways by which art \u2015painting, architecture, popular prints, caricatures\u2015operates as a potent discursive programme within French society. Its role as a dense symbolic language of communication and persuasion, and/or as a critique of social and moral values dominates our investigation. It also serves as a model to investigate the role of contemporary electronic and print media and their influence on our perceptions of society and the representation of power in the global world.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

Themes studied include the nature of the object, the monochrome, the body, the idea of nature, personal mythologies, the importance of light. The course includes visits to contemporary galleries and museums. Conducted in French.                                                                    Contemporary French Theatre: Theatre and Politics -\u00a0DRLIT-UA 9270 or FREN-UA 9721 - 4 points                               This course will examine contemporary and classical French theater from a new perspective. Far from scholarly chronological norms, we will use contemporary writings in order to better study their classical sources and inspirations. Theatre is an artistic discipline that is constantly in communication with its past. Theatre examines its roots in order to reorient and renew itself. Actors and directors reinvent the verses of Corneille, Moliere and Shakespeare so that they can better discover the writings of today. Dramaturgists reflect contemporary society, yet are always nourished by their predecessors so that they can either create a connection or break with them definitively. In this course we will examine great contemporary authors such as Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad, etc. As for the great classical figures, we will discuss such various authors as Sophocles, Corneille, Shakespeare and Racine. How did Jean-Paul Sartre use Corneille and Racine to give credence to his theatre? How was Cocteau or Giraudoux inspired by ancient theatre? What did Koltes take from classical tragedy in order to create his own dramas? This course will examine both theatrical writings as well as current productions in order to answer these questions. All the performances seen for the course as well as the works read will be discussed in oral presentations or written summaries. Conducted in French.                                                                    French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.

The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

(NYU, SPAN-UA 100 or equivalent)   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings. Conducted in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The course will first offer an overview of German theater traditions before 1900 and will then engage in analyzing specific developments in German theater starting with Max Reinhardt and his work at the Deutsches Theater Berlin. Other case studies will focus on Brecht\u2019s epic theater, theater during the Third Reich, postwar theater trends in East and West Germany, and current developments in reunified Germany. Not only will we closely read relevant plays and theory by the theater makers of the respective periods but we will also explore aesthetics and performance issues as they have changed over time. As the involved practice of dramaturgy in Germany has greatly influenced theatrical developments, we will investigate this major aspect of theatrical work in Germany as a contribution to world theater and study how the extensive debate of ideas is being concretely realized in the theater through the choices being made in a production. An integral part of the course will include visits to Berlin theaters, attending performances, which we will analyze in class, and engaging in discussion with contemporary theater makers in Berlin.

To achieve the first two objectives, guest speakers will be invited to talk about specific topics, including the history, society and culture, religion, indigenous and contemporary health and political systems and their relevance in contemporary Ghana. These lectures and discussions will be complemented by site visits and excursions to major historical and cultural sites. It is hoped that these talks and field trips will provide the relevant background information for students to understand some of the issues raised in their classes as well as their day-to-day encounters within their new environment. Regarding the third objective, there will be three introductory lessons in the Twi dialect of Akan, the most widely spoken local language in the country.   This course will combine talks, discussions, field trips and assignments. Four 1 - 1.5hrs guest lectures, two site visits, and two language lessons will form part of the orientation activities in WEEK 0. In the first six weeks of the semester, there will be two additional field trips and film screenings. Each student is expected to write three 2-page reaction/reflection papers on any of the talks, site visits and film documentaries.

The overview investigates not only the country's experiments with authoritarianism - the experiences of mass murder, war and division - but also its emergence as a democratic leader, in the arts and human rights, and as Europe's power broker. We examine questions of citizenship and diversity, Germany's 'special' responsibility as a leader in Europe, the role of the Holocaust in State governance, Berlin's status and development as an industrial and cosmpolitan metropolis, and new avenues for German identity. We ask how these histories have made today's Berlin Europe's most exciting capital - a nexus of youth culture and the interational arts scene - and Germany a vanguard of the arts, sustainable energy, technical development and global politics.

Through an approach to local, cultural, and political issues the course will address how Argentina interacts with the region and the world, and how this international context impacts on Argentina. The emphasis will be on addressing a number of concepts that are necessary to understand Contemporary Argentina, politics in Buenos Aires and their relationship with the world. Spanish spoken in the Rio de la Plata region will be taught from a pragmatic approach, encouraging the learning and use of local expressions and Argentine Spanish, including political expressions used in the media, political activism and the everyday life of porte\u00f1os \u2013the inhabitants of Buenos Aires.

Students also benefit from basic instruction in Italian language; this instruction is designed to supplement their formal language courses and to enable them to function in their new surroundings.                              London                                                  Global Orientations: British Culture                               We often hear that Britain is a global country and London is a global city, but what does this mean? In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

This workshop will help you to be able to engage in Spanish culture and language by means of an active, practical and lively learning experience. During Orientation week and over the course of the semester, you\u2019ll attend sessions with NYU Madrid professors, tour Madrid and surrounding cities, visit two of Madrid\u2019s most renowned art museums, take a weekend trip to a different part of Spain, and you\u2019ll have the opportunity to take part in interactive workshops (Spanish cooking, wine or dance). Finally, you\u2019ll read an article that will help you to reflect on your observations of and experiences in Madrid, and you\u2019ll write a brief paper incorporating your conclusions. All in all, Global Orientations seeks to help you make the most of your experience in Madrid so that you leave knowing where you\u2019ve been and how the experience may have affected you as a person.                          Paris                                                    Global Orientations: Reflections on Modern France - GLBL-UA 9107                               This course aims to explore the place that Paris \u2013 and more broadly France -- hold in the public imaginary, while examining the tensions and antagonisms that rightfully complicate that view. Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.                              Prague                                                    Global Orientations: The Czech Republic in a Global Context                               The purpose of this class is primarily to discuss the history and culture of the Czech Republic and Central Europe\u2014the intersection of many international influences--in the context of globalization and, conversely, to discuss globalization in the local context. An important dimension of the class will be a discussion about how international students should use their experience abroad (in this case Prague and, more generally, Central Europe) to better understand complicated developments on the global level and back at home.   Taught by Dr. Jiri Pehe with a team of NYU Prague professors                            Sydney                                                    Global Orientations: Australian Society and Culture                               Australian society is replete with contradictions. Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Global Orientations: Israeli Society and Culture                               This course is designed to help you understand contemporary Israel \u2013 the society, its problems and its pre-occupations. Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.                          Washington, DC                                                    Global Orientations: Citizens and Communities in Washington, DC                               This course will introduce students to the citizens and communities in and of Washington, DC. Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC. Students will consider the current state of affairs and be challenged to imagine how the future might be different. Respectful, factual, passionate and influential dialogue will be encouraged and expected.

It will focus on the how environmental health issues are defined and approached by civic groups, governmental officials and researchers. It will highlight how environmental threats come to the attention of the public and weigh the options for addressing these threats. Finally, it will underscore the need for multi-disciplinary approaches in understanding these threats and crafting solutions. We will focus on prevention of environmentally mediated diseases and discuss challenges to effective prevention.

It is intimately related to public health and policy making, as it provides elemental \u201cinformation for action\u201d. This course is designed to introduce students to the history, basic principles and methods of epidemiology.     Topics covered in this course are history, background and different perspectives of epidemiology, measures of disease frequency; measures of association; epidemiologic study designs; public health surveillance; outbreak investigations; assessment of causality; and relationship between epidemiology and public health policies. In addition, students are expected to develop skills to critically read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiological studies and mass media sources.

This course introduces students to key concepts in health policy formation, implementation and evaluation in a global context. Using a comparative lens, students explore organization, financing and delivery of health care services and health systems around the world. We examine the role of governmental and non-governmental agencies in delivering care and contributing to a health care infrastructure using case studies and other materials in a comparative approach. Key lessons in the implementation of new health policies and initiatives are explored across the developing world, as well as in a US as students explore health system performance, the quality and cost of care, the management of health care services, the process of health improvement and health reform. The course will use a multidisciplinary approach that employs sociological, political, economics, and ethical perspectives. The objective is to build an understanding of the fundamental ideas, issues, and problems currently debated in global health policy and management and to provide a foundation for future studies and careers in the global health field. Epidemiology in a Global World and Health and Society in a Global Context are recommended but not required pre-requisites for the course.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

The scheduled activities are divided into theory-practice classes and cultural visits. There are required readings for the classes which are usually based in a general bibliography that will give the student a factual context of each unit. Ideas exchange will take place, so the students should read the material in advance in order to continue with the course. The objective of cultural activities is to link the students with the material dimension of history, putting themselves in contact with crucial clues for its comprehension.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Public Intellectuals: Dissent and Direction in Europe - HIST-UA 9249 - 4 points                               Public intellectuals have an important role to play in society: they are supposed to speak the  truth. They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

In the eighteenth century, Britain prided itself on the liberty enjoyed by its people, yet it was the largest participant in the Atlantic slave trade, and grew rich on the wealth created by ports such as London, Bristol and Liverpool. In the same period some 15,000 black people lived in English ports and their presence has only recently been properly acknowledged. In the nineteenth century, however, Britain perceived itself as in the forefront of the global battle to end the slave trade and slavery itself. This pioneering campaign contributed to a more positive sense of British national identity. Yet Britain continued to depend on the importation of slave-grown produce and even began to ship hundreds of thousands of Indians as virtual slaves to many parts of the world. The ambivalent legacy of Britain\u2019s past involvement with slavery remains important to Britain's multi-cultural identity and its global role today.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. As a special focus, we will examine the significance of the liberalization of the airwaves in emerging democracies such as Ghana.

Students should also be prepared to pay up to \u00a3100 or $150 for extra tickets while in London as part of the Methods &amp; Practice course.     Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

The course proceeds by the reading and analysis of contemporary journalism and classic travel pieces: careful examination of the narrative; fictional and literary devices used in travel writing; examination of and practice with various information gathering strategies; consideration of the ethics of representation. Students will continually develop stories from their own travel experiences for presentation and in-depth critique in class. These regular assignments will prepare students for their final project: a substantial travel narrative of their own. Participants must meet deadlines set for assignments. Participants may not submit previously published or completed work for the assignments.

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

It is about truth and truthiness and how to tell the difference. It will be part overview and lecture on topics central to the course and part active reporting and writing. To take advantage of the unique Washington location and distinct attitude in the city, students will participate in press conferences and go to public hearings on Capitol Hill in reporting roles and then write news-style articles. The class will include a focus on the 2014 midterm elections. Invited guest speakers are from NASA, NOAA, environmental activist groups, energy lobbyists and Washington media. The intersection of the media with science, politics and economics on the issue of global warming will be a focal point of this course.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

We will consider how to compare American and Chinese governance systems, and whether and how concepts can be translated between them\u2014so that the countries, and their citizens can learn from, and cooperate with, one another. In the process, we hope to learn about China, but also to reflect\u2014in the light of 9/11 and Iraq-- more deeply on our own understanding of how American governance works\u2014and how it is seen by the world.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

The interpretative classes will run concurrently with production management, sights and sound, and post-production workshops. The course will have three objectives: (1) teach students the documentary tradition from Flaherty to Rouch; (2) use critical Cinema theory to define a document with a camera; and (3) create a short documentary film.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

Both historical and sociological dimensions of environmental movements are covered, with particular attention given to how issues of environmental protection and social justice intersect. At NYU Berlin, the course includes American (I), European, and in particular German (II), as well as global movements (III).                                                                        Global Connections: Berlin Trends - SCA-UA 9634 - 4 points                               This course examines diverse current urban trends in Berlin and their connections to  worldwide phenomena. It focuses on the way that different social groups (according to  class, milieu, origin, gender or sexuality) appropriate urban space and constitute  place-specific identities.  It uses the city of Berlin with its multiple layers of history as a laboratory for  contemporary urban research with historical, empirical and theoretical material. We will  study key debates on urban developments, partly as field visits, in regard to housing,  migration, gentrification, and we will search for the creative and the sustainable city.  You will be introduced to the contemporary discourses on those trends and to new  ways of reading and seeing a city.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

More than 30 years have passed since 1979, the year when a self-styled Islamic Revolution unfolded in Iran. Historian Eric J. Hobsbawm branded this revolution as &quot;one of the central social revolutions of the twentieth century&quot;; and social scientist Richard Cottam described it as perhaps &quot;the most popular revolution in the history of mankind.&quot; Whatever the case may be, we are now permitted to use the benefit of hindsight to revisit the 1979 revolution. In the first part of the course we will review the manifold causes of the 1979 revolution in a historical perspective, tracing the social, political, economic and cultural bases of the rise of the revolutionary movement and political Islam (or Islamism) in Iran. We will then move on to situate the revolution in a global context. This will enable us to examine Iranian history since 1979 in comparative perspective as well as to integrate the revolution into the &quot;entangled histories&quot; of modernity of which it is part. At the same time we will examine the cultural dimensions of the post-1979 state in Iran. We will consider cultural production in the Islamic Republic of Iran as a site of state domination and oppositional resistance. We will suggest that the Islamic Republic is a &quot;scopic regime,&quot; developing a symbolic Islamism as a tool of propaganda and hegemony. At the same time, literature, cinema, and the visual arts have been sites of resistance.

We will go through harmonic instances of advanced chromaticism of the late 19. century and up to the very edge of tonality. Emphasis will be put on assignments and exercises in order to develop good creative and analytical  skills in harmony. Concurrently we will examine the main formal principles of tonal music and apply  our knowledge in analysis of selected compositions. We will use various analytical approaches and  test them on a large scale of historical musical material. Every student will be due to realize at least one analysis of assigned composition during the semester.

Is free will an illusion? What is knowledge? Is belief in God rational? and Whom ought I to save? In discussing these questions, important distinctions will be introduced and there will be attention to rigorous argument, including the nature of deductively sound argument.   The classes will involve informal instruction and discussion, with a focus upon clarity and argument over a range of topics, though also, it is hoped, with a lightness of touch.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.

Our exploration of political theory will proceed from a  close reading and analysis of seminal texts that are presented both conceptually and,  for the most part, chronologically. The primary focus will be placed on examining the  historical antecedents of some of the foundational concepts and practices that  distinguish our political behavior and institutions today. While taking account of the  historical complexities and stylized conventions of each text, the course will highlight  the recurrent themes that animate these influential writings and continue to shape our  contemporary understanding of politics. In particular, the lectures and discussions will  be geared towards tracing the conceptual underpinnings of current forms of political  organization, such as the nation-state and liberal democracy, and their effects on the  concerns of law, justice and morality. Some of the critical issues to be discussed  include the divergent views of human nature and ideal society, the structure of  authority and sovereignty, states of emergency, the defense of liberty, equality and  justice, and the different models of democratic practice.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

The topics covered in the first part will include the US vision of the new international order, the end of the old European balance of power, the Cold War and the division of Europe, the building of the Western alliance, the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. The second part of the course will concentrate on contemporary issues ranging from the evolution of NATO to trade relations and the role of the dollar and the euro in the international monetary system. Particular attention will also be given to the challenges posed by the \u2018war on terror\u2019, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Conducted in English.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

Presents a study of post-World War II Italian politics and society in comparative and historical perspective. Seeks explanations of Italian political development in specific historical factors such as the 19th century patterns of state formation and the experience of fascism. Comparative analysis seeks to show how the social structure, political culture, and party systems have shaped Italy's distinct development. Current and recurrent political issues include the problem of integrating the south into the national economy and state response to social movements, particularly terrorism. Conducted in English.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Political Economy of Developing Countries - POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               Millions of lives around the world are impacted by natural disaster, war and other crises every year. Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.   Sample Syllabus                          Paris                                                    France and the European Union: Europe in Crisis - EURO-UA 9122 or POL-UA 9523 or FREN-UA 9122 - 4 points                               The purpose of this seminar on European integration is to give the students a few keys in understanding what the European Union is and how it works; how it affects every day policies of the member states as well as the life of European citizens; what kind of world actor the EU is or might become; what political consequences the current financial crisis might have for the EU. Conducted in French.                                                                      France and the European Union - EURO-UA 9123 or POL-UA 9523- 4 points                               This course investigates the history, the structure and the inner logic and working of European integration from the end of the Second World War to present day. It will provide students with an overview of the political institutions, the member states and the current developments of the European Union while focusing on the paramount role played by France throughout the years. Conducted in English.

Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      European-American Relations in the 21st Century - POL-UA\u00a09598 - 4 points                               This course explores the recent history and the current state of political, economic and cultural relations between the United States and Europe. Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      East European Government and\u00a0Politics - POL-UA 9522 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the modern politics and government of Central and Eastern Europe from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to the present. We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Western European Comparative Politics -\u00a0EURO-UA 9510 or POL-UA 9510 - 4 points                               This course will concentrate on the analysis of the pursuits of democracy in Western Europe. Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.

The first part examines competing approaches to international politics, explains their basic concepts and rationales, and evaluates their explanatory insights. The principal objective of this part is for students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which various theoretical perspectives lead to different understandings of the structures and practices of world politics. The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Diplomacy &amp; Negotiation: Conflict Resolution in the Middle East - POL-UA 9720 - 4 points                               International negotiation has become the most widely used means of conflict management in international affairs. Negotiations of international significance are today conducted not only between individual states, but also within and beyond them. At the same time negotiation practice itself is undergoing much change with changing patterns of conflict and intervention, new urgent issues on the global agenda, new actors and new emerging norms.   This course provides an overview of negotiation and conflict resolution theories and practices of international importance \u2013 bilateral, regional and multilateral. The emphasis is on different approaches/aspects to understanding what drives the negotiation process and explains the outcome. Why do some negotiations succeed, while others keep failing? Why do some peace settlements succeed while others fail? We will examine not only the official negotiation process but also the important functions of pre-negotiation, second-track diplomacy and post-agreement negotiations concerned with implementation and compliance.   While we will give many examples from various civil and international conflicts, our main focus will be on two regional conflicts \u2013 Cyprus and the Arab-Israeli conflict. There will also be guest lectures by some of those who were involved in peace negotiations in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - POL-UA 9994 or RELST-UA 9613\u00a0or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.   Sample Syllabus                          Washington, DC                                                  American Public Opinion &amp; Pressure Groups - POL-UA 9342 - 4 points                               While not required at NYU Washington, DC, we strongly recommend that students take POL-UA 300 - Power and Politics in America prior to enrolling in this course.   This class will examine the origins of public opinion research, the impact it has on news coverage, political campaigns, public discourse, elected officials, and in many cases, public policy outcomes. You will learn how to read, analyze, and critically-evaluate public opinion research; you will learn about \u201cleading\u201d and \u201ctrailing\u201d research indicators; and you will learn why \u201ccharacter\u201d attributes often matter more than \u201cperformance\u201d attributes and issue position. You will see how political campaigns, lobbyists, public relations professionals and others leverage public opinion to impact perceptions and political, policy and business outcomes. And because this course is being taught in the nation\u2019s capital, where politics and policy converge--and against the backdrop of a close and hard-fought presidential campaign\u2014we will also hear from political professionals from both political parties, congressional staffers, and journalists, who will share their insights about how they apply public opinion research to conduct campaigns, shape policy, report the news, or address business challenges.   There is an existing and established core reading list for this course, which we will use as the foundational reading for the course. Each week\u2019s lecture topic will cover the assigned reading topics and apply them to real-life examples, so that they can be more easily and clearly understood. Young people often tell me how much they enjoy politics, and sometimes ask whether it\u2019s possible for them to make a career doing politics, and what is the best way to make it happen. If you are one of those young people, this course is designed to help show you how to do it.   Classes will begin with a discussion of the reading assignment, and how it might apply to a specific aspect of public opinion research. Following the discussion on the core materials, we will analyze and discuss a political or issue poll (including tracking and other polling from the previous week, since this is the campaign season and there will be many public opinion research instruments released during the semester), and/or a guest lecturer, who could be a public opinion researcher, a campaign operative, a congressional or committee staffer, or a member of the national news media who covers campaigns.

All other students should register under POL-UA 9530. For Non-BPE Stern, this course does not count for Stern credit, though Stern students are welcome to take this course as an elective.   Pre-requisites include successful completion of one of the following courses: (1) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) at the Square, (2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) at the Square, or (3) World Politics in London. A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.   NYU students at the Washington study away center will be primarily form the College of Arts and Science and the Stern School of Business BS in Business and Political Economy.

It integrates social action and psychological research in culturally diverse contexts. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the breadth of topics, social issues, and research approaches that characterize community psychology. These topics include the history of Community Psychology, major theoretical approaches, and the nature and methods of community research. In addition, the course explores different perspectives on mental health, and research and practices related to programs intended to promote or prevent certain behaviors. Finally the course explores the relationship between communities and social change. Teaching will be in the form of lectures, discussions, and class presentations.

During the course of the semester we will discuss many different aspects of cognition: perception, attention, memory, language, concepts, reasoning, problem solving, expertise, creativity, and decision making. The emphasis in the course will be on how psychologists have used experiments to help construct theories of how the human mind works and how human thinking occurs. The class will involve lectures, student presentations, discussion, video material to accompany lectures, and occasional example class experiments. The course also has a practical component, for which students work in small groups and conduct an empirical study, which they write up in a research report.

Effective leadership plays an integral role in bridging communities that historically were separate, but today exist side-by-side in a culture that is religiously and spiritually diverse. This course seeks to prepare students to become aware of faith traditions other than their own, with a strong emphasis on learning techniques and theories of how to engage others. We will look at different theories of religions, current examples of leadership and communities, influence of media, and movements around social justice and service in hopes of laying a foundation for solid connections across religious communities.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators.

Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.

Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.

Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.

Sydney                                                  The Australian Experience - SCA-UA 9809 - 4 points                               This course offers a wide-ranging critique of Australian culture and society. It aims to interrogate Australian society with a methodology that draws on critical race theory, feminism, social geography and cultural studies. It will look at issues such as the relationship between Australian settler culture and Aboriginal Australians; Australia\u2019s experience of migration and multiculturalism; Australians\u2019 relationship with their environment; and Australians\u2019 sense of national identity. In particular, it will consider how these issues have played out in popular culture.   This course offers a special experience for students wishing to broaden and deepen their methodologies of cultural analysis. Australian society is fascinating in itself, but it also offers a unique perspective on transnational issues such as identity formation, social justice movements and the experience of multiculturalism. For instance, given Australia\u2019s history of Indigenous and non-Indigenous relations, the issue of race in a post-colonial context is particularly acute here. Through comparison with the Australian experience, students will develop a more critical view of American and global society. Students wishing to pursue a career that involves cultural analysis will benefit greatly from studying Australian society, in Australia, and thus developing this comparative approach.   This course has three interweaving themes of study: race, class and gender. This course will look at how these issues have played out in various facets of Australian culture, ie: attitudes to the landscape; representations of crime; humour; and art. The course is bookended by sessions that consider place-making in Australia: an introductory session that looks at exploration and mapping, and a concluding session that looks at popular music and geographies of place.

Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

Attention will  be paid to the social and intellectual context of these thinkers, but the primary  focus will be on their ideas and their relevance to the analysis of modern society  and social processes.

The course will focus on the current realities and future possibilities of global higher education at the backdrop of its historical and conceptual coordinates. A glance at the con-temporary higher education landscape reveals ambivalent trends and directions: Excellence and internationalization protrude as paradigms that drive universities to secure their stakes in the global higher education market. National politics of education further enhance this competition among institutional front-runners by launching excellence initiatives or entering in supranational Bologna-type arrangements to facilitate cross-border academic exchange and knowledge production. Hence a range of distinct regional approaches to global education have emerged from national models and practices of education.    This course will serve as a site of academic dialogue between NYU and HU students in one classroom by pursuing the following three steps. First, it seeks to familiarize its participants with the visions and promises of global education while also paying attention to potential perils involved in globalizing national models of education. Among others, we will address questions such as: How are modes of producing and disseminating knowledge affected when education crosses borders? What does global education demand from student learners and how are globally educated citizens envisioned? How can experiences of knowledge production and education specific to one context be made operable in another? In a second step, the course introduces and compares regional approaches to global education. Different national histories of higher education yield different answers to the questions formulated in the first step. Yet, debates center around (one) global education, not educations. This tension requires scrutiny and, in a third step, it will ask students to develop an informed and critical position on the stakes of global education.  In order to make use of the unique classroom setting the course will employ independent (out-of-class) and in-class, individual and collective, analytical and interpretive formats. Students will be particularly encouraged to fully embrace the learning impulses resulting from the inter-cultural encounter between NYU and Humboldt students. The language we are going to acquire in this course is called global education. By starting to learn its rules and formulas, students are likely to see possible future trajectories of educational development and might even envision their future role in it. The class work will culminate in a colloquium at which both NYU and HU students will present their final group projects.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.

The course is a mixture of classroom discussions and field trips (in conjunction with discussions in rooms provided by the National Museums of Berlin) to different museums in Berlin, with a focus on the five major museums on the Museum Island, which have been build over a period of 100 years (1830-1930). We will also talk about the newest addition to the Museumsinsel, the Humboldt Forum scheduled to open its doors in the reconstructed city palace on the Schlossplatz in 2019. Discussions will focus on the nature and social function of museums as well as their role as places where the image of the state and its civil society are constantly reshaped, until the era of global migration. Other topics include museums architecture, museum and identity, museum and education, museum and the 21st century. Previous knowledge of art history, architecture, or German history is not required, but useful.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.     Sample Syllabus                          Florence                                                    Quantitative Methods - POL-UA 9800 or Statistics for Social Research - SOC-UA 9302 - 4 points                               In our society the need for deep understanding of what is going on translates into a need to keep track what has happened, how to outline trends, plan the future knowing the present or the past. We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Politics of Organized Crime: Italian Mafias in a Comparative Perspective - SOC-UA 9506 - 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of criminal organizations in Italy and abroad. Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                            Shanghai                                                    Global Connections: Shanghai - SCA-SHU 9634 - 4 points                               The main aim of this course is to facilitate a rich engagement with Shanghai. The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - POL-UA 9994 or RELST-UA 9613\u00a0or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.

After completing this course, students who wish to continue studying Spanish must take a qualifying examination. Students who pass the examination may go into SPAN-UA 3, which is preparation for SPAN-UA 4. Students with high scores on the qualifying exam may enroll in SPAN-UA 18 (an accelerated version of SPAN-UA 3, which similarly prepares them for SPAN-UA 4) or in SPAN-UA 20. Completion of either SPAN-UA 20 or SPAN-UA 4 fulfills the MAP requirement.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

(NYU, SPAN-UA 100 or equivalent)   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

Introduction to literary analysis through close reading of texts from the early to modern periods of peninsular Spanish and Spanish American literatures. Engages students in the practice of textual explication, provides basic critical skills, and encourages reflection on literature as a system. This course is the gateway course for students interested in pursuing advanced literature courses in Spanish. With very few exceptions, students must have completed Critical Approaches before taking advanced literature courses taught in Spanish.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Myths, Icons, and Invented Traditions: A Cultural History of Latin America -\u00a0SASEM-UG 9151 or SPAN-UA 9201 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.     Mitos, \u00edconos y tradiciones inventadas is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the rich and complex history of Latin America through the study of some of its most known and iconic cultural expressions. It does also work as an introductory map to the most influential and widespread approaches in Latin American social sciences, cultural studies and literary criticism. Thus, students will not only have a first encounter with key historical processes that lie behind some well know cultural icons, but also will be introduced to arguments and ways of writing that help constitute modern Latin American educated Spanish. The course will be structured in seven topics; each topic will be covered in two weeks. During these four classes, students will be exposed to different kinds of cultural materials, including literary texts, film, papers from several disciplines, theater plays, art shows and live concerts.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Literatura Y Terror - SPAN-UA 9550 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.   Este curso se propone discutir y examinar diferentes formas en que el terror aparece y se despliega en la literatura rioplatense (mayormente en Argentina, aunque tambi\u00e9n incluye algunos escritores del Uruguay) desde mediados del siglo XIX hasta la actualidad. El terror es uno de los elementos constitutivos de la literatura y la cultura rioplatense pr\u00e1cticamente desde sus or\u00edgenes. En varios de sus textos considerados \u201cfundacionales\u201d, el terror, vinculado directamente con ciertas pr\u00e1cticas pol\u00edticas, es motivo de reflexi\u00f3n al mismo tiempo que se vuelve un eje alrededor del cual se organiza la escritura. Pero ese inter\u00e9s por el terror se manifiesta no s\u00f3lo a trav\u00e9s del an\u00e1lisis pol\u00edtico, filos\u00f3fico o hist\u00f3rico de la cuesti\u00f3n, sino tambi\u00e9n a partir de un tratamiento literario que parece exhibir mejor que cualquier an\u00e1lisis la esencia y el funcionamiento del terror. Por eso la presencia del terror en los inicios de la literatura rioplatense tambi\u00e9n puede y debe analizarse teniendo en cuenta otra perspectiva: la del terror en tanto g\u00e9nero o modo de lo literario, derivado directo de la narrativa g\u00f3tica que surge en Europa en la segunda mitad del siglo XVIII. Ese cruce entre terror pol\u00edtico y terror literario es una marca que est\u00e1 en el origen de la literatura rioplatense y que va a perdurar, con algunas variantes, hasta la actualidad.    El prop\u00f3sito del curso es partir del repaso de algunas definiciones y conceptos vinculados con el \u201cterror\u201d, para luego hacer un an\u00e1lisis de diferentes textos de la literatura rioplatense, desde los inicios, en los que es perceptible claramente el cruce entre pol\u00edtica, literatura y terror, pasando por otros momentos en los que esa relaci\u00f3n se resignifica y el terror toma formas diversas, pero sin abandonar ese cruce fundacional.

(NYU SPAN-UA 100 Advanced Grammar &amp; Composition or equivalent.)   This course deals with themes of culture, cultural identity and the politics of culture and identity, with reference to five specific Latin American cases: a). Indigenous communities of the Amazon (Achuar) and the Pampas-Patagonia region (Mapuche, Rank\u00fclche); b) Andean peasants (Aymaras) and indigenous proletariat of the Chaco (Toba); c). working class and ethnic neighborhoods of the city. By means of this empirical survey we hope to illustrate and discuss the some of the different ideas that have come to the fore in recent debates about \u201cculture,\u201d including essentialism and constructivism; rethinking of the nature/culture dichotomy; and the idea of cultural identity as a right, as a strategy of domination or as a form of resistance, etc.     Sample Syllabus                                                                    Introduction to Latin American Studies - SPAN-UA 9760 - 4 points                               Please note Intro to Latin American Studies is no longer offered under SPAN-UA 9762 with Spanish instruction/assignments. This course is now taught in English only.     This course is designed to introduce students to some of the most important problems and debates about Latin American history, society and culture. Latin America is a complex region full of contrasts. Its population is both racially and culturally heterogeneous. Its many countries share some common cultural roots and political origins, but also have distinct histories. The structure of this course is primarily chronological but also thematic. We will start with the Conquest and its legacies and we will end with the problems that we experience today in big cities in Latin America. The course favors a multi-disciplinary approach, and therefore we will use a different array of materials including films, letters, photographs and essays. We will emphasize first hand accounts of the topics we discuss.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Borges and Argentine Literature -\u00a0SPAN-UA\u00a09845 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.     The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Cinema in Latin America: Contemporary Argentine Cinema - SPAN-UA 9750 or ICINE-UT 0105 - 4 points                               A survey of anticolonialist cinema with special emphasis on Latin America. Despite conditions of economic and political oppression, Latin America has managed in recent years to forge a dynamically original cinema. After studying some European films that highlight the colonial background of current struggles in the world, we take a brief look at African cinema and then look closely at Latin American cinema, with films from Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Cuba. The emphasis throughout is on a common theme \u2013 the struggle against foreign domination and on the search for an authentic, innovative national cinematic style.

This course is directed to students in SPAN-UA 9020 that would like to perfect their Spanish and acquire knowledge about Hispanic language and culture in the United States. The study and debate in class on a variety of materials (literary texts and periodicals, advertisements, radio programs from the Internet, movies) will permit us to take on current topics related to the Hispanic presence in American society, for example, emigration, border culture, Hispanic media, &quot;Latin&quot; identity, problems of gender and ethnicity, the political importance of Hispanic communities and bilingualism.   The principal objective of the course is the development of the student's communicative capacity through written and oral presentations, debates, and commentaries on each week's materials, as well as listening comprehension and vocabulary exercises. As a secondary objective, the student should acquire a consciousness of the reality of the United States as a place of encounter and transformation of different cultures, including Hispanic cultures that today play a predominant role.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

Madrid Symphonies: Engaging with the City Through Documentary Film - SPAN-UA 9951 - 2 points                               Through the process of making short (3-5 minute) \u201ccity symphony\u201d documentary films, this course offers an exciting opportunity for students to explore, engage with, and represent aspects of life in Madrid that are not often seen in mainstream media.   \u201cCity Symphony\u201d takes its name from the \u201cCity Symphony\u201d documentary subgenre, in which a filmmaker attempts to capture the rhythm, dynamism and texture of a city or neighborhood. The form emerged in the 1920\u2019s and often celebrated modernism and the triumph of the city as an urban form. Classic examples include William Ruttmann\u2019s Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis, Joris Ivens\u2019 Rain and Paul Strand and Charles Sheeler\u2019s Manhatta. More recent examples such as Huang Weikai\u2019s Disorder have turned the form on its head.   In this intensive hands-on production workshop, students will make their own \u201cMadrid symphonies\u201d. They will be encouraged to look, listen and explore Madrid with a documentarian\u2019s gaze, to represent the city from new perspectives, and to seek out places, images and stories that deepen, contextualize or counterpose pre-existing notions of Spain and its peoples.   This course offers a special opportunity to get to know a new place and new peoples, produce a meaningful and lasting creative work, learn to \u201clook\u201d at the world as a documentarian, increase one\u2019s sensitivity to stories that we encounter every day, and appreciate the myriad of subtleties in how to tell those stories.

How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class. There will be a written examination at the end of the semester and a dissertation on an aspect of Ghanaian society and culture that students might choose to explore.

The course examines certain recurring themes and critical issues in post-colonial narratives in Africa. It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    African American English - LING-UA 9023 or SCA-UA 9799 - 4 points                               Introduces the language behavior of African Americans.

The languages covered include Swahili (East Africa), Hausa and Yoruba (Nigeria and West Africa), Xhosa (Southern Africa), and Somali (Horn of Africa). The literature is discussed largely according to major genre types, such as poetry and song, oral narratives, and written prose literature. No knowledge of these languages is required for the course.                                                                    Perspectives on African Experience - SCA-UA 9789 - 4 points                               The course familiarizes students with a selection of the varying perspectives from which African experience has been perceived, analyzed, and interpreted, primarily by Africans and persons of African descent, both on the continent and in the diaspora.                                                                    Language in Africa -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09911 - 4 points                               An introduction to thinking about the human faculty of language within a specifically African context. The course focuses on issues of language within the framework of human society at all levels, and not so much on language as a structural entity. Topics include the general characteristics of human language; the description of the languages of Africa; the question of language and cultural contact in Africa; and the contemporary issues of language and sociopolitics in Africa.                                                                    Contemporary African Literature -\u00a0SCA-UA\u00a09912 - 4 points                               The course examines not only the common concerns but also the diverse traditions, as a result of historical, social, and cultural imperatives, that have informed the literature produced by African writers. Topics include colonialism; the question of language; race and identity; nationalism and literature; modernity; exile; and the politics of gender in the African context.                                                                    Culture in Africa - SCA-UA 9913 - 4 points                               The aim of the course is to introduce students to cultural dimensions in Africa, and to ways of approaching the study of culture in Africa. It focuses on three overall themes: orality, performance and identity, exploring ways in which these find expression primarily (though not exclusively) through language, religious belief, music, literature, nationalism, and popular culture. After presenting a general theoretical framework for the study of the themes, it concentrates on specific cultural contexts, illustrated with &quot;case studies&quot;. Students are also encouraged to do further reading within other culture areas of Africa and the African Diaspora.

The main goals of the course are: to describe the historical development of French-African relations from the colonial to the post-independence era; to investigate the political, economic and cultural mechanisms of French influence in contemporary Francophone Africa; to understand the consequences for France of complex developments subsequent to colonialism, such as African immigration in France. Conducted in French.

It considers both traditional aspects of life and how people live their lives in this first decade of the new millennium. How Ghanaians perceive and conceive themselves and their society; how others view the society and life of Ghanaians also receive critical attention. The course emphasizes that Ghanaians are not an undifferentiated lot and that what the different people say their behavior should be differs from what their actual behavior is. Students will get to examine these varied perceptions and perspectives as well as construct their own representations of the society. The course will also attempt to answer questions about Ghana and Ghanaians that are of interest to the non-Ghanaian getting acquainted with the country. The course combines talks, readings, discussions, visits, and students' presentations in class. There will be a written examination at the end of the semester and a dissertation on an aspect of Ghanaian society and culture that students might choose to explore.

This course aims at helping students to understand the distinctiveness and uniqueness of Russia's cultural, social and political traditions vis-\u00e0-vis not only Western Europe, but also vis-\u00e0-vis the countries of East-Central Europe which until recently constituted a part of the Soviet sphere of influence locked behind the Iron Curtain. By attending to the complexities of the dynamics of the centuries-long interaction between the &quot;Russian civilization&quot; (Russkiy mir) and the diverse nations and cultures of East-Central Europe students will be encouraged to appreciate the social, political and economic significance of seemingly subtle differences between the historical experiences, identity narratives, and value systems of various peoples, who tend to retain their particular cultural patterns of thought and social behavior despite geographical proximity and growing interconnectedness brought about by globalization. While the course is primarily addressed to students of Russian and Slavic Studies, of European history, and of European politics, its focus on the explanatory power of particular cultural outlooks of peoples and nations which provide the context for individual and group decision-making makes this course suitable also for students of other social and cultural sciences. Without adequate understanding and appreciation of both commonality and diversity of human experience we are risking profound misreading of the intentions and expectations of the others, and this in turn is likely to lead to mismanagement of international affairs despite our best intentions to make our globalizing world livable and hospitable to all.                                                                    Roma in Central East Europe: Enthnographic and Historical Overview Of A People Without A State - ANTH-UA 9200 - 4 points                               The course will introduce students to the development of Romany politics and culture from a persecuted minority through to the emergence of Romany organizations with an emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. The aim is to challenge any essentializing view on Roma as either a people outside or/and without society or as perennial victims of oppression. Two main approaches have dominated the teaching of Romany issues: a culturalist/ethnic approach, which stresses Romany cultures, and an economistic approach, which stresses \u00b4poverty.\u00b4 This course will challenge mono-causal and a-historic explanations for the social situation of Roma and will stimulate students to think about Roma in a critical holistic way that brings into consideration the societies they live in. Building on a diverse selection of empirical material, ranging from ethnographic, historical and sociological case studies to artistic representations of Roma, the course will present the Roma \u201cas good to think\u201d for our comprehension of current social issues. The course is divided into three interconnected thematic blocks \u2013 1. Identity, community and culture, 2. Power, the State and social stratification, 3. History, memory and politics of representation \u2013 which will allow to cover much of the current debates on the plight of European Roma as well as a grasp of social theories on marginality.

The role of anthropology in the representation and governance of Indigenous life is itself an important subject for anthropological inquiry, considering that Indigenous people of Australia have long been the objects of interest and imagination by outsiders for their cultural formulations of kinship, ritual, art, gender, and politics. These representations\u2014in feature films about them (such as Rabbit-Proof Fence and Australia), New Age Literature (such as Mutant Message Down Under), or museum exhibitions (such as in the Museum of Sydney or the Australian Museum)\u2014are now also in dialogue with Indigenous forms of cultural production, in genres as diverse as film, television, drama, dance, art and writing. The course will explore how Aboriginal people have struggled to reproduce themselves and their traditions on their own terms, asserting their right to forms of cultural autonomy and self-determination. Through the examination of ethnographic and historical texts, films, archives and Indigenous life-writing accounts, we will consider the ways in which Aboriginalities are being challenged and constructed in contemporary Australia.   The course will consist of lectures interspersed with discussions, student presentations, and films/other media; we may also have guest presenters.

It focuses on some of the regional and historical variations of Aboriginal art in the context of the history of a settler nation, while considering the issues of its circulation and evaluation within contemporary discourses of value. Topics include the cosmological dimensions of the art, its political implications, its relationship to cultural identity, and its aesthetic frameworks. Students will visit some of the major national collections of Indigenous Australian art as well as exhibitions of contemporary works. There will also be guest presentations from Indigenous artists and Indigenous art curators.

Eluding most attempts at tidy classification, sound art can share formal elements and concerns with traditional sculpture, film and video, performance art, conceptual art, architecture, installation, and of course with music. This studio course will explore sound across its many and sometimes contradictory vectors, allowing students intensive work on sounds and their composition, as well as on projects that explore the broad and rich interaction of sound with other disciplines of art.    There are two main tenets of the course. The first is that issues fundamental to sound art engage some of the key problems of modern and contemporary art. Rather than viewing sound as a peripheral practice, we will see how it has been decisive in the narrative of 20th and 21st century art, exciting many of the key debates that carry through to this day. The second principle is that listening, or careful observation, can be primary in the creative process, coming before expression. From John Cage onward, the value of listening, of observation as a primary creative act, has re-attuned many strains of western art (from conceptual, minimal, and land art to media and installation art) to new ideas of process, complexity, and ecology.    This course can be approached from any level of experience. No previous work with sound or with digital media is required, only a willingness to explore the boundaries of art-making that is a natural outgrowth of working with sound as an artistic medium.

Rappers shoot videos in art galleries. Biennials  proliferate, art fairs geographically expand, and auction sales hit new records. At the  same time, public arts funding is systematically slashed, emerging artists still struggle,  and art criticism remains in its perpetual crisis. The international contemporary art  world is a convoluted interplay of aesthetics and economics; ego and idealism. Berlin\u2019s  art world may be more production-based and experimental than the art scenes of other  major western cities, but it is still a microcosm of larger movements.  Through readings of art theory and criticism, discussions, site visits, guest speakers,  and short- and long-form response writing, this course offers an overview of the  conventions, trends, history, current developments and myriad structures and  substructures of the contemporary art world in general and Berlin\u2019s in particular. The  course delves into contemporary art\u2019s current prevailing discourse via methodological  analysis, practical observation, and input from professionals currently working in the  art\u2019s institutional and commercial sectors. It also offers a critical look at how these  larger art-world structures translate to Berlin.

The massive political, economic, and social changes the country has undergone since the end of the Cultural Revolution in 1976 have dramatically altered the country\u2019s cultural landscape. In this seminar course, the course will survey the main development areas in Chinese contemporary art from the end of the 1920s to the present day. Dedicated to responding to the new textures of China\u2019s metropolitan culture, it will look at the relationship between visual arts, new media, architecture, and performance in the mega-city of Shanghai, often regarded as the cradle of Chinese modernity. The class will be complemented by guest lectures and visits to public museums, galleries and artists\u2019 studios in and around Shanghai. Students will have the opportunity to meet leading figures from the art world in China as well as the international art community, including artists, museum directors, curators, art critics, and art dealers.

The course serves both as a survey and critique of the literature on West African art, and as an exploration of method and theory in sub-Saharan art historical research. Students explore major works from key periods of Ghanaian artistic and cultural production and are involved in practical work in laboratories and museums dealing with art specimens from local archaeological sites and ethnographic contexts.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.  Tours will alternate with classroom discussions and workshops.

The city of Florence will be the classroom as students study the masters, explore museums, examine texts, and analyze the historical significance of monuments. With eyes cast simultaneously on painting, the graphic arts, sculpture, and architecture, this class will explore a broad range of art patronage that included religious and civic bodies, princely courts, and a growing number of private clients. The course will focus on points of intersection, transition, and the transformations that lead from one tradition to the next. Above all, our approach will encourage critical thinking and a search for unifying connections in studying the underlying logic of image making. Works will be examined on their native terms: both as physical objects, with sensitivity to their particular function and intended reception, and as visual images active within larger contexts.

We adopt the approach of art history, architectural history,  and urban planning to study the buildings and monuments of Florence from antiquity to the present. On site, students consider buildings in context, and learn how to describe the architectural language used by architects over the centuries. Students learn about the building materials and technologies. They learn how to identify the typology and dynamics of buildings, monuments, and outdoor spaces, and their transformations (in form and function). They experience the coexistence of private and sacred in religious buildings, and of private and public in both residential and civic buildings.

Due to Italy\u2019s strong historical legacy, modern Italian artists and architects have gone through an intense struggle to break from academic models. Initially the new movements, such as Impressionism and Art Nouveau, arrived from outside sources, yet beginning with I Macchiaoli, followed by the Futurists, Neo\u2013 Rationalists, Arte Povera, and Transavanguardia, Italians were frequently originators of the discourses of new artistic movements. The tide of trends periodically seceded from traditions and then returned to them in critical ways, seen in the metaphysical paintings of Giorgio de Chirico or the wistful pavilions of Aldo Rossi. During the past decade Italy has produced several new institutions for contemporary art and architecture, including MART in Rovereto, the Museo del \u2018900 (Museum of the 20th century) in Milan, and MAXXI (Museum of the Arts of the 21st century), devoted specifically to both art and architecture, broadening the historical and critical perspective and providing a stimulus for the art of the future. The course includes two site visits in Florence, one day-trip to the Venice Biennale, one day-trip to Rome.

A survey of British painting, sculpture and architecture of the 17ththrough 20th centuries. Museums, galleries, churches, palaces and stately homes in and around London will be visited to examine and critique major works.

London has some of the richest collections of renaissance art in the world. Students in this course will be brought into direct contact with a large variety of artefacts to be found in museums and galleries such as the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum as well as the British Library. Works by Van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Durer and Holbein will be examined alongside those of less well-known artists. Rather than provide a standard chronological narrative of European Art History c. 1400- c. 1600, focus will be placed on subject areas such as the altarpiece and the private devotional image, the renaissance portrait, graphic practices, print culture, the materials and functions of sculpture, myth and allegory, the cabinet of curiosities, the concept of the 'Renaissance' itself. These topics will not be organised around traditional national or regional 'schools' considered in isolation from one another but instead interconnections will be explored between the development of different types, technical processes and cultural practices across the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. A special case will be made of the English Renaissance, in order to place it within the wider European context through additional visits to Westminster Abbey and Hampton Court.

London, like New York is a rich and complicated city. Unlike New York however, it has been continuously occupied for just under 2000 years. Almost every epoch of London\u2019s history can be detected in the city\u2019s architecture and distinctive streetscape.   This course is designed to work in three ways. Firstly it is an opportunity to learn about London\u2019s architecture and art by physically exploring it. Secondly this class is an introduction to sketching and keeping a travel notebook, a basic and useful skill that any liberal arts student should have an experience of. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this course teaches how to 'read' a town or city. The ability to visually make sense of European built-environment should really help in understanding the architecture of New York City and, of course, town and cities throughout the United States, and anywhere else.

Contemporary art raises vigorous debate and criticism. But what is contemporary about contemporary art? This course introduces you to some of the key issues in dealing critically with contemporary art with a focus on work on display in exhibitions in London, both major national collections and private galleries. The course explores art produced since the late 1950s through case studies of the work of individual artists and through themes which include photography; representations of the body; gallery display; migration, visual imagery of political issues, video practice and installation art. Among other things we consider how contemporary art came to look as it does [with a focus on British art]; the different forms of material and presentation artists have employed; why and how diverse audiences are addressed; how markets, national prizes and private collections shape the kinds of art produced and inform public taste. We also look at the collection and display of contemporary art, on a private and a public scale; dealer galleries and issues of curation.

It is an area in which there have been some remarkable successes in recent years both in America and in Europe: impressive and much loved public buildings have been given new life by progressive architects and developers, helping ensure that our towns and cities retain their individual character. Unlike international modern buildings, historic buildings are strong markers of the industry, aspirations, local materials and resources of a particular place. Recycling old buildings is crucial so our architectural and social history can be read in the townscape that surrounds us.   A course about recycling old buildings presents an opportunity to explore some basic themes in the built environment \u2013 architecture history, environmental issues and the rise of the conservation movement in the 19th and 20th centuries. Buildings are responsible for 50% of our carbon emissions each year, and more than half of a building\u2019s energy footprint is expended in the relatively short spell of its construction. Re-using our redundant historic architecture for new purposes has obvious positive benefits for the planet. Equally, upgrading historic buildings in use, like our housing stock, is environmentally smarter that demolishing parts of our cities and starting again with new structures.   The locations and nature of industrial production has changed across the world. Most western cities have a surfeit of industrial spaces and buildings lying empty, often in their centres. This course will first cover the story of the development of industrial architecture from the 18th century onwards and look at how these robust, proud and often highly decorative structures can accommodate new uses. Based in London, we will have the opportunity to visit a number of key examples of re-use where we can see first-hand how industrial history, modern technology and the changing use of our city centres combine to form this essential story in contemporary urbanism.

This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

The course will be rooted in a discussion of the city of Prague, and students are encouraged through excursions and assignments to become acquainted with the city's architecture, monuments and urban design. Students will learn to analyse formal aspects of art and architectural styles (from Romanesque to modern) and will also be encouraged to investigate their sources and theoretical foundations. Emphasis will be given to the historical and cultural context of art styles and movements. We will also look at art patronage in some key periods of Czech history to see how this reflects political, cultural and ideological change. Classroom lectures will be combined with regular excursions to examine works of art and architecture at first hand. These will include architectural walking tours and visits to temporary exhibitions as well as the city's major art galleries.

This course provides students with an overview of the theoretical traditions inspiring current research in international relations (IR). IR is a discipline which attempts to explain processes and events in world politics. Primarily emerging as a way to explain the behaviour of nation-states and their interactions, the discipline has expanded with the onset of globalization to explore an array of actors, institutions and processes which include but simultaneously transcend the nation-state.   The course will focus on the major theories of IR, and how theoretical debates inform key literature in major subfields of the discipline. The course is constructed in such a way as to familiarize students with core debates and cleavages in the field, for example between behavioural and ideological approaches to the study of world politics. There will also be a focus on some of the key substantive subfields of IR such as international organisations, humanitarian intervention, and global governance. Lastly, there will be ample opportunity for students to model international political behaviour through the application of rational choice and game theory. Students will be encouraged to use this as an opportunity to explore the efficacy of such approaches and their alternatives, to explaining the behaviour and actions of different actors in world politics.

Marketers in all organisations require an understanding of the many facets of marketing, beyond simply advertising or communications. The American Marketing Association defines marketing as:   \u201cMarketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.\u201d   The course focuses on the role of marketing and its importance in contemporary organisations and society. During the session, students will critically explore marketing principles, concepts and models from a practical perspective. Beyond studying the theory of marketing, students will analyse a variety of real-world examples and case studies. Organisations need to create a balanced, coordinated marketing mix, where all elements of its marketing activities work together. Marketing also requires combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to gain an understanding and reveal insights into the internal and external environment. To achieve this, the course uses a combination of lectures, class discussion, case studies, assignments and exams. The remainder of this syllabus describes the course and students responsibilities.

This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.

Women writers have emerged at the forefront of the movement to restore African women to their proper place in the study of African history, society and culture. In this process, the need to recognize the women as literary artists in the oral mode has also been highlighted. Furthermore, the work of women writers is gaining increasing significance and deserves to be examined within the context of canon formation. Authors and texts will be examined, focusing on such topics as the heritage of women's literature, images of women in the works of male writers; women in traditional and contemporary society; women and the African family in the literary tradition; literature as a tool for self-definition and self-liberation; African women writers; female expressions of cultural nationalism in the Caribbean; female novelists of the African continent; Black women dramatists; the poetry of African women.

It begins with a look at the debate and polemics around post-colonialism as a critical and theoretical concept. It then dwells on specific narratives, mainly novels by African writers, works located in the period following classical colonialism. The reading of these narratives is informed by such critical issues as the crisis of cultures in contact; personal, class, ethnic and national identities; the politics of gender; debates over language; the aesthetics and politics of art; strategic transformations in narrative form, etc.   Sample Syllabus                          Florence                                                    Topics in 20th Century Literature: The Two World Wars in Literature - COLIT-UA 9190 and  SASEM-UG 9202 - 4 points                               This course may be counted towards the Cultural Specialization and Elective requirement for Comp Lit majors, with prior DUS approval.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

With the war and subsequent occupation of Europe, literature, especially poetry, replaced consensus politics. Poets became the true accountants, and their ledgers contained the unprofitability of the human soul.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

Although the Italian peninsula was home to some of the most important ancient civilizations, Italy\u2019s existence as a united country dates only from the nineteenth century, making it younger than the US as a modern nation state. Italy was first unified by the Romans, making Roman antiquity a point of reference throughout history as intellectuals and political leaders dreamed of a unified nation. We examine how Italian identity was formed throughout history, both by Italians and by foreign visitors to Italy, in response to the principal ancient cultures that thrived on the peninsula. The focus is on primary sources\u2014literary works, artifacts, art objects, works of architecture, opera and film\u2014taking advantage of the unique resources of Florence to explore these in their original contexts.

As such, it conveyed a sense of a multi-national empire ruled by monarchs, but developing over time into a benign, democratic, constitutional monarchy, generally through peaceful, not revolutionary change. The British have seen themselves historically as freedom-loving, independent, industrial, tolerant, Protestant and individualistic. These myths of national image have been forged partly through conflict with other nations over many centuries and reflect a nationalistic pride in military success and the maintenance of the largest empire the world has ever seen. Changes since 1945 have seen the collapse of that empire, membership in the European Union, large-scale immigration, changing gender politics, and the devolution of power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. This has inevitably led to major challenges to traditional British views of their national identity. Includes fieldtrips to key sites.

Concentrates on epistemological constructions of Spain\u2014the idea of Spain\u2014that emerge from competing external and internal perspectives. Students examine how this national culture is constructed, first analyzing Spain from North African perspectives through Sephardic nostalgic poetry and the Hispano-Arabic literary traditions. The American perspective pits notions of Spanish imperial power and grandeur against the Black Legend, a term that Protestant circles in Europe and the United States promoted to attack the legitimacy of Spain\u2019s New World empire. A final focus on European views analyzes the depiction of Spain as the embodiment of German and French Romantic ideals beginning at the end of the 17th century and the reemergence of the same notion during the Spanish Civil War (1933\u201336). Throughout, students examine principal textual and visual images that contribute to the historical and contemporary construction of a national culture that emerged at geographic and cultural crossroads.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

For the last 300 years, since the era of Peter the Great, Russia\u2019s greatest statesmen, philosphers, religious thinkers, writers, poets and creative artists were obssesed with the question of Russia\u2019s distinctive cultural identity. This passionate search for the \u2018Russian soul\u2019 is apparently far from over, as the recent rise of interest in the ideas of \u2018Eurasianism\u2019 and \u2018Neo-Slavophilism\u2019 testifies. This course in Russian intellectual history explores the sources of Russia\u2019s unique cultural blend through examination of some of the principal textual and artistic images representative of traditions that emerged at the geographic and cultural crossroads of Eastern Europe, including those which constitute Russia\u2019s unique contribution to world culture. Students are encouraged to think critically and with a historically informed sensibility about the diverse perceptions of reality in cultures different from their own, especially about such fundamental categories as national identity, religion, morality, community, individual, gender, and the &quot;other.&quot;   Sample syllabus                                                                      Cultures and Contexts: Prague, in the Heart of Central Europe -\u00a0CORE-UA 9548 - 4 points                               Prague is without doubts one of the most important historical, geopolitical and cultural capitals of Central Europe. The concept of Central Europe is somewhat elusive and it is difficult to define it by geographical or political categories. Often, it is characterized simply as a space on the edge between the West and East. However, most scholars agree that there is a distinct Central European culture. Identified as having been one of the world\u2019s richest sources of creative talent and thought between the 17th and 20th centuries, Central Europe was represented by many distinguished figures such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Kant, Goethe and Hegel; later followed by Kafka, Rilke, Freud, Mendel and Dvorak, to mention at least some. Central European culture is based on historical, social and cultural characteristics shared by the countries of this geopolitical entity. It is a result of complicated historical, political, ethnic, cultural, artistic and religious interactions throughout more then thousand years of its history. We explore characteristics of Central Europe primarily from the perspective of Prague and its cultural history, which is so typical and almost archetypal for this region. Students study geopolitical characteristics and various phenomena that co-create the idea of Central Europe. Taking advantage of course location in Prague, students have the opportunity to examine the primary sources and artifacts (literature, music, art, film) in their contexts and environment.

Students read and attend representative comedies, tragedies, and histories, their selection to be determined by the plays actually in production in and around London, particularly at the Barbican, New Globe, and Stratford to which at least one excursion will be made. Special attention will be given to the playhouses and the influence they had on the art of the theatre, actors' companies, and modes of production and performance. Lectures and discussions will focus on the aesthetic quality of the plays, their relationship with the audiences (then and now), the application of the diverse attitudes and assumptions of modern critical theory to the Elizabethan stage, the contrasting structures of Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean drama, the new emphasis on selfhood and individuality, and the major themes of hierarchy, order, and justice, the conflict of Nature and Fortune, the role of Providence, the ideals of love, and the norms of social accord. Opportunities will be given to investigate the interrelations of the plays and other arts, including film, opera, and ballet.

Far from scholarly chronological norms, we will use contemporary writings in order to better study their classical sources and inspirations. Theatre is an artistic discipline that is constantly in communication with its past. Theatre examines its roots in order to reorient and renew itself. Actors and directors reinvent the verses of Corneille, Moliere and Shakespeare so that they can better discover the writings of today. Dramaturgists reflect contemporary society, yet are always nourished by their predecessors so that they can either create a connection or break with them definitively. In this course we will examine great contemporary authors such as Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad, etc. As for the great classical figures, we will discuss such various authors as Sophocles, Corneille, Shakespeare and Racine. How did Jean-Paul Sartre use Corneille and Racine to give credence to his theatre? How was Cocteau or Giraudoux inspired by ancient theatre? What did Koltes take from classical tragedy in order to create his own dramas? This course will examine both theatrical writings as well as current productions in order to answer these questions. All the performances seen for the course as well as the works read will be discussed in oral presentations or written summaries. Conducted in French.

If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

Although its size and extent are exceptional. the crisis has many features in common with similar financial-stress driven recession episodes in the past. However, this time there\u2019s something different, with the crisis being global akin to the events that triggered the Great Depression of the 1930s. This crisis spread quickly and rapidly moved from the US to European countries that show the weakest economic indicators (PIIGS: Portugal, Ireland and Italy, Greece and Spain). This course will focus on the long run causes, consequences and EU responses to the crisis, conditionally on the characteristics of the countries involved. We will focus on the long process of European Integration and discuss whether it may represent a possible solution to the recent crisis.

It will cover topics ranging from the characteristic properties of classical socialism: political structure, ownership, co-ordination mechanisms, growth pattern, investment, prices, wages and employment in the system. The course then discusses inducements for reforms and experiments with market socialism. The main focus is issues of transition: political transformation, economic stabilization, privatization, corporate governance issues, changes in employment, income distribution and social security. The course analyzes political aspects of the transition process and identifies the main political constraints of economic decisions taken by transition countries. Finally, the course focuses on the accession of transition countries to the European Union, on its economic and political aspects. Basic principles of EU economic policies are discussed and framed into the transition process of Central European countries.

The subject of the course is to describe one of the most profound changes to take place in the history of the world economy - the rapid change from centrally planned economies to market economies throughout what used to be known as &quot;the Soviet block&quot;. Although some reforms in some countries began much earlier, the true transition began in most Central and Eastern European countries roughly in 1990. This means that scholars and researchers are only now beginning to have the data and a sufficient distance needed to study and analyze the transition process.

The Gothic flourished especially in the nineteenth century, creating a whole vocabulary of new creatures and landscapes and two of the great books of the genre: Frankenstein And Dracula. This course concentrates on the great works of Gothic which are central to an understanding of literature, film, early Romanticism and popular culture. Specialising on the works of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries we will also explore how those texts were reinvented for film and what new elements were added in the twentieth century. Using a selection of texts and using a variety of approaches from the historical to the post modern and the feminist to queer theory we will explore the multifarious levels of meaning in Gothic texts as well as looking at narrative strategies and a variety of themes including the political and revolutionary, the erotic and the exotic, the Promethian and the undead, the role of religion, the role of women, the Wandering Jew and the 'mock' medieval.

We shall be concerned not only with topics of place and setting, but also with issues of individual and national identity, as well as with forms of verse, drama, and fictional narratives. We shall be seeing a performance of Marlowe\u2019s Dr Faustus at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, witnessing justice in action in a London court, as well as visiting the houses of Dr Johnson and Charles Dickens, Tate Britain, and viewing screen versions of a couple of our chosen novels. Texts will be studied in chronological order; the course is weighted towards literature of the last 100 years. The Oxford Book of English Verse will help give us a sense of continuity and change.

The aims of the course are to encourage student to think historically, in terms of the way London and representations of the city have changed and developed over time; and theoretically, in terms of the way the city is mediated through different forms and genres (e.g. poetry, novels, essays, film). We will also examine the texts in relation to issues such as gender, the definition of the modern metropolis as a labyrinthine city of Babylon, the influence of metropolitan culture on Modernism and Modernity, assimilation versus multiculturalism, immigration, and the effects of new modern spaces on individuals.

Students read and attend representative comedies, tragedies, and histories, their selection to be determined by the plays actually in production in and around London, particularly at the Barbican, New Globe, and Stratford to which at least one excursion will be made. Special attention will be given to the playhouses and the influence they had on the art of the theatre, actors' companies, and modes of production and performance. Lectures and discussions will focus on the aesthetic quality of the plays, their relationship with the audiences (then and now), the application of the diverse attitudes and assumptions of modern critical theory to the Elizabethan stage, the contrasting structures of Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean drama, the new emphasis on selfhood and individuality, and the major themes of hierarchy, order, and justice, the conflict of Nature and Fortune, the role of Providence, the ideals of love, and the norms of social accord. Opportunities will be given to investigate the interrelations of the plays and other arts, including film, opera, and ballet.

In addition to major texts from Australia and New Zealand, we will also encounter a range of works from Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, and the Pacific islands. Some questions we will tackle include: How have the cultural, historical, and economic processes of colonialism, diaspora and migration connected and shaped this diverse region? How have issues of race and indigeneity been central to various discourses of nationalism? What particular roles have Australia and New Zealand, as sub-imperial powers, played in the region? Finally, what can the latest generation of migrant writing in Australia show us about new forms of interconnections across the globalizing Asia-Pacific? Students in this course will examine novels, poetry, films and theoretical texts to develop critical thinking, reading and writing skills. Along the way, they will gain a solid grounding in the problematics of postcolonialism, race, diaspora, indigeneity, nationalism and multiculturalism.

In this course we consider the cultural reverberations of ecological awareness\u2014focusing on literature, cinema and visual art. Eco-criticism is a relatively young field of study in the humanities, developed in response to twin crises: actual environmental degradation, and a breakdown in intellectual categories of \u2018the natural\u2019 brought on by technology and politics. This course provides an opportunity to reflect on a number of key tropes in ecological thinking including wilderness, pollution, animals, food and apocalypse. Learn about a philosopher who survived a crocodile attack, the beach at the end of the world, how to prepare and eat Australian moths, and why the Large Hadron Collider is a metaphysical machine. Principle texts in this course include American and Australian novels, films and documentaries, read alongside supplementary sources in literary, audio and artistic mediums. We ask how literature\u2014one of the richest arenas for the practice of human imagination\u2014does, has, or could shape environmental thought and action. How does the non-human world enter into human artforms? What are the historical and structural obstacles to admitting different forms of consciousness into text? What literary genres and styles are called forth by the huge ecological challenges of our times?

In order to assess these challenges and systems, the course introduces a comparative dimension \u2013 looking at not only the Chinese system, but the American system as well, examining the environmental challenges and governance system of the United States, as well as the broader context within which China and the U.S. together constitute the two primary sources of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Is it possible to compare the American and Chinese systems? Can concepts of governance and assessment be translated between the two systems? What can China learn from the U.S.? What can America learn from China? Will the profound differences in our political and economic systems make environmental cooperation impossible, leading inevitably to conflict? Will globalization and technological innovation lead to healthy competition and cooperation to address common problems?

We will meet for a weekly in-class seminar, except for three to four weeks during the session set aside for field trips. Our field trips will give us the opportunity to experience environmental issues first-hand, meet people, gather story ideas and find local Australian context for our own writing. Guest speakers will join us occasionally to further explore key issues. Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

But study limited to Europe would be pointless; the Old Continent is no longer the prime player on the planet. Therefore a series of related topics and areas will also be discussed: U.S. military might (especially compared to the European armed forces); the situation in adjacent regions (North Africa, Middle East, Russia and Ukraine) and its implication for Europe; and the new types of terrorism.

We will track how Europe has reached the present critical juncture in its history and consider where it is headed, including the options available to European policy-makers amid the on-going crisis in the Eurozone. To this end, we will examine the key events of the 19th and 20th centuries that led to the foundation of the EU and have shaped contemporary Europe. At the same time, we will consider Europe\u2019s relations with the US as today\u2019s sole superpower, the challenges posed by the resurgence of China and Russia and Europe\u2019s role as a major player in the resource-rich Eurasian continent, where a new round of great power competition is unfolding.   The course draws largely on political economy but also on history, international relations and geopolitics. It aims to raise questions and stimulate discussion rather than provide clear-cut answers.

The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

Firstly, the conception of Europe will be explored in its historical perspective and different perceptions: territorial, political, spiritual, cultural etc. Secondly, the characterizing social cleavages of Europe will be introduced: territorial, economic, religious, national, ethnic etc. Furthermore, we will discuss how these cleavages get expressed in the formation of different social interests and lead to the organization of interests groups, political parties and NGOs. Thirdly, turning towards the institutional structures of West European parliamentary democracies, we will address the existence of political party systems, as well as the executive and legislative powers represented by government and parliament. Fourthly, we will explore the rules and outcomes of different electoral systems, which ensure regular rotation of political elites at power \u2013 however, under different principles. Finally, we will assess the enrichment of the classical models of government in Western Europe, which have in the last 20 years been supplemented by additional players participating in the decision making processes on different levels (local, regional, national and European) \u2013 leading to new political conceptualization of \u2018governance\u2019. Also, while European states remain core units of European integration, they are also influenced by the EU, leading to their Europeanization. The new challenges facing Western Europe, such as globalization, continuing European integration, regionalization, restructuring of social welfare systems and the issues of identity, will be discussed.

The films in this course offer critical perspectives on the history of colonisation in Australia; the legacies of the Stolen Generations; the controversies surrounding Australia\u2019s role in World War One; as well as Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific Asian neighbours. We will focus on films that have marked significant shifts in public consciousness about the past such as Gallipoli (1981), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Balibo (2009). We will also draw on films that have employed innovative narrative and aesthetic strategies for exploring the relationship between the past and the present such as Ten Canoes (2006) and The Tracker (2002). Throughout the course, students will develop their understanding of the basic methods and concepts of cinema studies. In particular, students will develop a critical vocabulary for analysing how filmmakers have approached the use of memory, testimony, re-enactment, researched detail, allegory and archives across a diverse range of examples.

This pragmatic approach will not only allow students to improve their pronunciation, but also to understand the poetic genre, the quality of poets\u2019 language, their interest in etymology, metaphor, imagery, etc. Close readings, paraphrase and translations will allow students to considerably improve their mastery of the French language so that they in turn will be able to produce poetry of their own. This course will help them to integrate the phonic, rhythmic and musical dimensions of poetry, as well as learn about its various uses, from the intimate to historical testimonies.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

We will discover the playwright Moli\u00e8re (1622-1673) who was also an actor, troupe leader, and the author of numerous plays which remain to this day the most frequently staged plays in France. The recurring themes in his plays will be discussed, particularly in relation to the time period during which the plays were written. We will also touch on the role of farce in the work of this playwright who was nicknamed in the 17th century \u201cthe foremost joker in France.\u201d Dramatic analysis of the plays chosen will require a comparative study of texts in French and in English.   We will read and analyze these texts out loud. Certain excerpts will need to be memorized. We will analyze the ideas expressed as well as the importance of certain words, of the images evoked, and of the punctuation used in order to bring to life the rhythm and musicality of the phrases. The ultimate objective of this course will be to arouse the creativity of each student with regard to the many possibilities for modern interpretation, notably in reimagining d\u00e9cor, costumes, and Moli\u00e8re\u2019s stances.   T he texts studied will be excerpts from the following Moli\u00e8re plays: Tartuffe, The Misanthrope, The Miser, The Bourgeois Gentleman, The Doctor in Spite of Himself, and Don Juan . The students will also be required to read three plays of their choice in their entirety.   Conducted in English.                                                                      French and Expatriate Literature - FREN-UA 9868 or SASEM-UG 9351 - 4 points                               In this course, we will explore the ways in which Paris plays a role in the representation of the subject. Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings. Conducted in English.

This course provides students an overview of museum practices in France, ranging from the historical impetus for the creation of museums to the contemporary conditions that shape museum practice. Responsible for the collection and preservation of objects deemed valuable, museums shape the way we see history and the contemporary world. In Paris, museums that are central to Paris\u2019s reputation as a city of art and culture are also the result of state intervention in the production, collection, and exhibition of works of art. This course will critically examine this link, looking at the motivations behind state support of artistic culture, and the extraordinary museums that resulted from this intersection of private collectors, public displays, and political agendas in France. Museums studied range from public institutions such as the Louvre to private collections such as the Mus\u00e9e Camondo, to the scientific and/or social role played by such museums as the Museum National d\u2019Histoire Naturelle, and the newer Musee du Quai Branly and Cite Nationale de l\u2019Histoire de l\u2019Immigration. Focusing on critical debates in museum accession policies, provenance research, and repatriation claims, we will highlight the increasingly global ambitions of French museums, and the challenges of situating French culture in this increasingly international context.

Far from scholarly chronological norms, we will use contemporary writings in order to better study their classical sources and inspirations. Theatre is an artistic discipline that is constantly in communication with its past. Theatre examines its roots in order to reorient and renew itself. Actors and directors reinvent the verses of Corneille, Moliere and Shakespeare so that they can better discover the writings of today. Dramaturgists reflect contemporary society, yet are always nourished by their predecessors so that they can either create a connection or break with them definitively. In this course we will examine great contemporary authors such as Jarry, Cocteau, Giraudoux, Sartre, Camus, Beckett, Ionesco, Koltes, Wajdi Mouawad, etc. As for the great classical figures, we will discuss such various authors as Sophocles, Corneille, Shakespeare and Racine. How did Jean-Paul Sartre use Corneille and Racine to give credence to his theatre? How was Cocteau or Giraudoux inspired by ancient theatre? What did Koltes take from classical tragedy in order to create his own dramas? This course will examine both theatrical writings as well as current productions in order to answer these questions. All the performances seen for the course as well as the works read will be discussed in oral presentations or written summaries.

French Cinema, French Culture - DRLIT-UA 9502 or FREN-UA 9781 - 4 points                                On December 28th, 1895, cinema was given its official characteristics by the Lumi\u00e8re brothers in Paris. If for over a century, the \u201cSeventh Art\u201d has been an essential element and a vehicle for French culture, the city of Paris has epitomized the evolution and contradictions of the French cinema industry. Focusing on the main tendencies in contemporary French cinema, we will ask the following questions: How do the French filmmakers depict the city of Lights, the City of Love, the City of Horror? How decisive a representation of Paris and its suburbs can be? Why do the images of Paris illustrate the history of French cinema? What do they show about French culture?     Conducted in French.

This course starts with a study of Gallo-Roman Paris (52-253 A.D.), highlighting archaeological artifacts, temples, thermal baths and theatres. Paris during the Middle Ages is then discussed, focusing on the problem of fortifications, as well as the rise of power of the absolute monarchy supported by the Church. We study the h\u00f4tels particuliers (large private residences) such as the Louvre, the Palace of the Ile de la Cit\u00e9, etc. The arrival of 16th century Italian architectural styles, as illustrated by the Louvre, and their impact on the Parisian architectural landscapes is also discussed. In the modern period we examine the Parisian Arches (Louis XIV and Napoleon I), the urban works of Haussmann (1853-1870), the Eiffel Tower, the Alexander III Bridge with the Grand &amp; Petit Palais and end with a discussion of 20th century architecture and the development of the D\u00e9fense district.

Approaches to Francophone Literature -\u00a0FREN-UA 9145 - 4 points                               During the 20th century French language literature underwent a considerable change. Until 1945, only ONE French literature existed, (possibly prolonged by other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, and French Canada). In 1985, diversity finally seemed to reappear. Thus, the \u201cSalon du livre de Paris\u201d chose the central theme: \u201cEcrire les langues fran\u00e7aises.\u201d  In this class we will concentrate on francophone novels from Africa that, other than their literary interests, approach questions of postcolonial politics. The objective is to discover and analyze the forms, styles, and themes these novels utilize that reveal a better understanding of the political and cultural issues of the 21st century.   Conducted in French.

A study of major trends, personalities, and events, the course seeks the meaning and a definition of what constitutes the cultural heritage of France. Primary sources and documents such as chroniques, m\u00e9moires, journaux, revues, and correspondences are used. Conducted in French.                                                                      Contemporary French Novel - FREN-UA 9731 - 4 points                               The major French novelists of the 20th century have moved the novel away from the traditional 19th-century concept. Proust and Gide developed a first-person-singular narrative in which the reader is participant. Breton uses the novel for a surrealist exploration. With C\u00e9line and Malraux, the novel of violent action becomes a mirror of man\u2019s situation in a chaotic time and leads to the work of Sartre and Camus, encompassing the existentialist viewpoint. Covers Beckett\u2019s sparse, complex narratives and Robbe-Grillet\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d novels. Novels are studied with respect to structure, technique, themes, language, and significant passages.

We consider art as it has been inspired by the written word (the Bible, mythology, epic poetry), art as inspired by and inspirational to literary works (Paul Val\u00e9ry and Degas, Jean Genet and Alberto Giacometti), art as a response to and initiator of 20th century crises in representation, both written and visual (Cubism, Dada, Surrealism). Drawing on the multiple art resources in and around Paris, the course will urge us to reflect on the meanings and signs of language, in its many forms. Conducted in French.

Through an exploration of contemporary issues and social movements, we will focus on how these groups have been constructed over time as historical and political categories with significant implications for social practice. Students will be encouraged to draw on resources in and around Paris as well as current events as an integral part of the course.

The Colonial Encounter: France-Algeria - FREN-UA 9865 - 4 points                               This course begins with an examination of the Algerian War (1954-1962), in order to consider its multiple ramifications for France and the Arab world. A long and terrible conflict, the \u201cevents\u201d in Algeria, as they were called at the time, signaled the end of the French Empire. It brought down the 4th Republic and gave rise to one of the largest exoduses in modern history, with the departure of over a million people from Algeria to France following Algeria\u2019s independence. The war has had major implications on French-immigrant relations, on the rise of the extreme right National Front in France, on the constitution of the French Jewish population, and on France\u2019s involvement in other Middle Eastern conflicts. The history of French-Algerian colonial relations will also be examined. Conducted in French.

(NYU, SPAN-UA 100 or equivalent)   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

This interdisciplinary seminar serves as a broad overview for several centuries of British male and female fashion trends, from roughly the Tudor period to today. The course focuses on ways that modes and standards of dress evolved in response to political, economic and technological developments; empire and immigration; changing gender and class formations; and the vagaries of popular culture. In short, the course examines not only what people wore at different historical moments, but why they wore what they did, and how they felt about it. Readings come from the fields of literature, history, art history, gender studies, and sociology.

The topic of clothing and adornment embraces a broad spectrum, from the need for protective covering to the desire for individual expression to the profit goal of international industries. Clothing epitomizes the way a fundamental necessity has been transformed by cultural construction---as well as desire and creativity---into a complex social indicator, a matrix of culture, class, gender identity and aesthetics. This course looks at the ways clothing and fashion are used by story tellers, in print and on film, from the ancient world to the modern as indicators of civilization, individuality, sensuality, polymorphous gender, guilt, and conspicuous consumption. In order to establish a critical grid and vocabulary with which to discuss fiction\u2019s use of clothing/fashion our sources will also include readings in cultural studies, art, sociology, economics, fashion theory, and semiotics.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Through the study of novels and autobiographies by Breton, Hemingway, Stein, Duras, Modiano, de Beauvoir, and Baldwin, we will ask, what is the role of place in the imagining or invention of the self? How does the experience of a specific city, Paris, influence the formation of identity? How do these authors represent, or subvert, the notion of the \u2018real\u2019? Although the focus of this course is literary, we will also engage with major political, cultural, and artistic movements of the period, exploring the ways in which our writers negotiate history through their writings.

In this course, we explore this comparison as a productive means for re-considering these terms. Why is the notion of \u201cethnic community\u201d so problematic in France? And why do Americans insist on the \u201chomogeneity\u201d of the French nation, even as, at various points throughout modern French history, France has received more immigrants to its shores than the United States? Through readings, film screenings, and site visits we explore the movements and encounters that have made Paris a rich, and sometimes controversial, site of cultural exchange. Topics include contemporary polemics on questions such as headscarves, the banlieue, the new Paris museums of immigration and \u201cprimitive\u201d art, affirmative action and discrimination positive, historic expressions of exoticism, n\u00e9gritude, and anti-colonialism. Occasional case studies drawn from the American context help provide a comparative framework for these ideas. Conducted in English.

For NYU Art History students this course counts for Art History Elective Credit.   This course investigates French art of the nineteenth-century, paying particular attention to the way in which historical factors informed artistic production during this period. Beginning with David, Neo-Classicism and the French Revolution, we will move to the Napoleonic period, Romanticism, the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, and trace the connection from Realism to Impressionism. The second half of the course will examine the disparate movements spurred by Impressionism, collectively referred to as Post-Impressionism (including Neo-Impressionism, Synthetism, and Symbolism), and will culminate with the rise of Art Nouveau at the end of the century. Throughout, we will interrogate how social forces (including politics, gender, race, religion, etc.) influenced the manner in which \u201cModern\u201d art was produced and understood in nineteenth-century France.

It is fundamentally about deciding not to conform with repressive regimes. It is also about choosing a mode of action that brings with it personal dangers even when, as is usual, it advocates non-violence. This course examines the nature and significance of civil resistance in Central and Eastern Europe in the 20th century. In studying resistance literature (including poetry and song), art and film, we will draw on ideas and arguments from the disciplines of history, political science, literature, art criticism, film studies and psychology.

The course will cover masterpieces of Russian, Hungarian, German, Polish and Czech cinematography, focusing on several crucial periods of history, in particular WWII and its aftermath, showing moral dilemmas of individuals and nations under the Nazi regime as well as revealing the bitter truth of the Stalinist years.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Modern Dissent in Central Europe: The Art of Defeat -\u00a0EURO-UA 9301 and SASEM-UG 9400 - 4 points                               Totalitarian ideologies which were used in European political discourse in the twentieth century to explain major historical changes have changed forever the relationship between the state and its citizens. The aspiration of the totalitarian state to acquire total control over individual lives through control of education, employment and health systems succeeded beyond anything perceived possible until then in any political regime after European Enlightenment. Nazism and Communism mobilized irrationally motivated mass support and won power in a very short time. Their success was partially based on a mass propaganda, using fear as primary instinctive argument against a picture of both external and internal enemies. The major focus of the course will be oriented towards topics trying to explain the reasons for mass support for totalitarian ideologies and states on the basis of individual psychology. We will examine psychological explanations of a selfvictimisation, role of a victim and a perpetrator, majority society response to mass human rights abuses and the abusive past. On this background a phenomenon of a political and cultural dissent will be introduced and discussed. The role of electronic mass media, antiglobalisation movements and global terrorism are discussed as possible modern vehicles of totalitarian tendencies and reactions against them.

In this course, we will break some of the clich\u00e9s which are stuck to Kafka's life and work and dive into the fascinating, intricate and profoundly humorous world of his thoughts and emotions. In Prague, the city that determined and held Kafka in its &quot;claws&quot;, we will trace the possible sources of the writer's private obsessions which became the general characteristics of modern men: The sense of isolation, the anxiety, the self-irony, the sense of responsibility and guilt, the quest for freedom, the struggle of an individual against the system. We will read selected works of Kafka, but also Meyrink - the author of Prague ghetto - and Milan Kundera. This course aims to bring the students to a point from which they can find their own genuine and intimate understanding of Kafka's writing.

Some writers revel in this geographically liminal space, some long to free themselves from it, and some are conflicted in their feelings. The remarkable diversity of literary representations of the region has helped shape its culture, history and politics. In this course, students will study the work of prominent Czech, Pole, Slovene and Hungarian writers who have influenced people\u2019s understanding of the region. Authors to be studied may include V\u00e1clav Havel, Franz Kafka, Imre Kert\u00e9sz, Barbara Korun and Czeslaw Milosz.

We will engage with a diverse range of readings \u2013 featuring many Australian authors \u2013 and discuss technical elements and affective poetics to learn how to \u2018read as a writer\u2019. Weeks are devoted to crafting the short story and poetry. Students will complete weekly \u2018microfiction\u2019 homework exercises based upon images they take or find, and participate in in-class writing exercises, all of which will contribute to the writing journal submitted with the final work. The class emphasises the importance of embodied interaction with the city through a field trip using \u2018The Disappearing\u2019 \u2013 a downloadable app featuring over 100 site-specific poems spanning a \u2018poetic map\u2019 of Sydney, created by The Red Room Company. Students will think about the possibilities of marrying new technologies with writing as they navigate using poems as landmarks. Students workshop their drafts during the course, learning how to effectively communicate critical feedback and how to be receptive to constructive critique. This takes the form of a discussion in-class and students are required to submit written critical feedback on their classmates\u2019 drafts in an online forum. At the end of the course students will have the opportunity to showcase their work at a reading night to the rest of the NYU Sydney student body and invited faculty.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates.

Focuses will be on the variant developments in East and West Germany until the fall of the wall and on life in Berlin today. What are the important incidents and changes in German culture and society after 1945? How has the city of Berlin developed since the fall of the wall? These, and similar questions, will accompany us throughout the semester. During the course of the semester, we will explore narratives, which are related to our topics from a variety of genres: narrative prose, newspaper/magazine article, TV/radio documentary, music, film, photo, and other visual material.

Anhand repr\u00e4sentativer Werke vermittelt er einen \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die verschiedenen Epochen und Gattungen, erste literaturwissenschaftliche Fachbegriffe werden erl\u00e4utert. Kontinuit\u00e4ten und Br\u00fcche, die als signifikante Entwicklungslinien oder Z\u00e4suren die Literaturgeschichte markieren, werden im historischen und gesellschaftlichen Zusammenhang diskutiert. Der Kurs wird durchg\u00e4ngig in deutscher Sprache unterrichtet.  Es ist das Ziel, in gemeinsamen close readings a) ein Verst\u00e4ndnis f\u00fcr die jeweiligen Texte und ihre politischen, kulturellen und sozialen Kontexte zu erarbeiten und b) die F\u00e4higkeit zur wissenschaftlichen Diskussion zu entwickeln. Gef\u00f6rdert wird dies auch durch kleinere spielerische Ein-heiten, in denen wir die Texte in die Gegenwart transferieren und so nach der Aktualit\u00e4t der Werke fragen.   The course provides an introduction into the history of German Literature from the 18th century until today. By reading representative texts, the student will receive an overview of various epochs and genres. In addition, basic terminology of literary studies will be explained. Continuities and disruptions, which influence the history of literature in significant ways, are discussed in their historical and social contexts. The class is taught entirely in German.  The course objectives are a) to develop an understanding of the texts and their political, cultural, and social contexts and b) to develop an ability of critical discussion through a close reading of literary works. This is also fostered by some playful teaching units, in which we transfer the texts into the present and investigate their current relevance.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The overview investigates not only the country's experiments with authoritarianism - the experiences of mass murder, war and division - but also its emergence as a democratic leader, in the arts and human rights, and as Europe's power broker. We examine questions of citizenship and diversity, Germany's 'special' responsibility as a leader in Europe, the role of the Holocaust in State governance, Berlin's status and development as an industrial and cosmpolitan metropolis, and new avenues for German identity. We ask how these histories have made today's Berlin Europe's most exciting capital - a nexus of youth culture and the interational arts scene - and Germany a vanguard of the arts, sustainable energy, technical development and global politics.

In recent years Britain has undergone striking changes in its social makeup, political outlook and cultural activities. Rapid change also brings tensions around housing, the National Health Service and education all of which are increasingly facing pressures from immigration, larger numbers of unemployed and the economic squeeze. The most recent census suggested Polish was the second is spoken language in Britain. So what is happening and why and how does it affect you as a visiting student?    Global Orientation: British Culture is intended to introduce students to ideas formed by global and local issues and focus on concerns regarding politics, the media, migration, the free market, foreign policy, cultural homogeneity and democracy that are the keys to modern British national identity.  The course in based around a series of lectures and talks by prominent speakers from British politics, culture, economics and the arts, and incorporates various optional excursions into London to see some of what is being talked about in action.

Through a series of conferences, site visits, and seminars, the course examines four key moments or themes as a means of apprehending the density of French cultural, social, and political life. Starting with French republicanism, past, present, and future, we consider how France, at once the preeminent site of experiments in democratic liberty, is also plagued by institutional entrenchments of class stratification and the dual specters of colonialism and post-colonialism. Turning to Paris, the \u201ccapital of modernity,\u201d we reflect on its 19th century emergence as a locus of phantasmagoria, mystery, and seduction, and the emergent capitalist forces that were shaping the urban landscape. We consider the early 20th century avant-garde, among the most important and radical artistic and political movements of our time, that opened new spaces in which to imagine the very terms of \u201cart\u201d and \u201cpolitics,\u201d to finish with a consideration of France in the contemporary moment, wrestling with global transformations, the crisis of the welfare state, and a tension between the reproduction of elites and a political commitment to equality that increasingly troubles the country\u2019s educational system, politics, and cultural life.     Interdisciplinary and \u201cinter-textual\u201d in scope, the course fuses expert lectures, textual analysis, and out of the classroom experience, to bring together the artistic, the literary, and the social scientific, against the backdrop of global transformation.   Class organization and assignments     This is a required course for all students at NYUParis. Students meet in assigned groups according to their language level; students with an advanced level of French may do their coursework in French. Students are expected to attend all conferences and site visits, to do the assigned readings and to participate in class discussions.                              Prague                                                    Global Orientations: The Czech Republic in a Global Context                               The purpose of this class is primarily to discuss the history and culture of the Czech Republic and Central Europe\u2014the intersection of many international influences--in the context of globalization and, conversely, to discuss globalization in the local context. An important dimension of the class will be a discussion about how international students should use their experience abroad (in this case Prague and, more generally, Central Europe) to better understand complicated developments on the global level and back at home.   Taught by Dr. Jiri Pehe with a team of NYU Prague professors                            Sydney                                                    Global Orientations: Australian Society and Culture                               Australian society is replete with contradictions. Aussies famously describe their nation as the lucky country, yet from the Indigenous perspective, it might more aptly be called the stolen country. Australia is the land of the fair go, which cruelly detains refugees; a multicultural nation with a history of a white Australia policy; a place with distinctive local traditions, which takes many of its cues from global culture; an easy-going country with a surprisingly large degree of governmental control over individual liberties; a highly urbanised population that romances the Bush and the Outback as embodying \u2018real\u2019 Australia; a nation proud of its traditions of egalitarianism and mateship, with numerous rules about who is allowed in \u2018the club\u2019; a society with a history of anti-British and anti-American sentiment that simultaneously hold strong political allegiances and military pacts with Britain and the USA; and a place with a history of progressive social policy and a democratic tradition, which has never undergone a revolution. This course strives to make sense of Australian society and culture by exploring the complexities and contradictions in Australia\u2019s self-image.   The course will be introduced with an overview, and followed by four sessions covering four distinct themes during Orientation and the first three weeks of semester. Each session will include a 1-hour lecture, either given by the instructor or a guest lecturer, and a recitation-style discussion. There are seven mandatory field trips: Sydney Harbour Cruise, Rocks Walking Tour, The Blue Mountains, Featherdale Wildlife Park, Balmain Bowling Club Lawn Bowls, Overnight trip to Inglevale Farm, and the NYU World Tour.

Together with tours and special lectures, the first half of the course will focus on some historical background. (The facts are important, but no one in the Middle East agrees on \u201cthe facts.\u201d In this part of the world, debates about the past have a huge impact on the present.) Without going too much into the past, we will examine the formative events of Israeli society, those events that explain the special features of Israel today \u2013 its politics, institutions, culture, popular thinking and more. The course will begin in 1948 and progress to contemporary issues, including the most controversial ones.

Students will learn about the unique history of the city by exploring how it was founded, designed, governed and developed to become an international capitol. We will examine components of culture and intercultural competence as we learn how diverse populations maintain their cultural identity, support their communities and integrate into the fabric of the city. The portrayal of the Washington, DC in film will be presented to help students understand how this reflects and shapes our understanding of contemporary and historical American political culture. The course will also examine how individuals leverage their positions through institutions and organizations to ignite change in areas such as environmental sustainability, political activism, and international causes. Stakeholders from United States and foreign government agencies, domestic and international organizations, the non-profit and for-profit sectors, as well as public and private groups will deliver guest lectures and join interactive discussions. These sessions will be developed in collaboration with faculty from major pathway disciplines for the site and complimented by field experiences including a walking tour and museum visit in Washington, DC. Students will consider the current state of affairs and be challenged to imagine how the future might be different. Respectful, factual, passionate and influential dialogue will be encouraged and expected.

Today, Jews have only one thing in common \u2013 every Jew asks what it means to be a Jew.\u201c These are words of David ben Gurion after the Second World War. The period of the 18th to the 20th centuries of modern Jewish history in Europe belongs to the most dynamic in the whole Jewish history. What are the reasons for such radical changes? Were there differences between the development in Western, Central and Eastern Europe?&amp;; How did the changes affect Jewish religious, cultural, linguistic and national identity? These questions build the core of this course.

The course begins with a discussion of the nature of West African society before the introduction of the Atlantic Slave Trade; and the relations among Asante peoples, other neighboring West African peoples, the indigenous slave trade, and relations with Europeans in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The Atlantic Slave trade itself is analyzed from historical, ethnographic, sociological, economic and political perspectives, focusing on Africa, Europe and the Americas. The immediate and long term effects of the Slave Trade on Africa are considered, as well as the history of the trade's Abolition, and the legacy of the Atlantic Slave trade in African, European and American societies.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

This course explores the interstices between State power and the individual in the context of Modern  Berlin and German history. Our exploration of individual confrontations with politics includes a  discussion of how individuals react to State terror\u2013\u2013through collaboration or resistance\u2013\u2013and how  identities flourish, transform or are extinguished under State policies. One important location for  individual responses to the State is the arts, and we explore in depth how State power has promoted or  stifled these creative voices throughout Europe. Special topics include coercive acculturation in Jewish-  German intellectual life, the destruction of the 20s musical Avant-garde, the rise of the Nazi Aesthetic in  Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s documentaries, the intrusion of State Security (the Stasi) in private life, the photorealist  reflections of painter Gerhard Richter on terrorism in Berlin in the 1970s, and Germany\u2019s literary  reassessment of individual and collective war guilt following reunification. Readings and lectures are  supplemented with walking tours of Berlin and its museums, to look at traces of historical, social and  cultural change that has affected individual experience in situ.

Student should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course will explore the unusually rich artistic and textual record of medieval holy people and places in Tuscany, and one site Umbria, Assisi. The goal of the course is to consider the intersection of popular religious expression, individual extraordinary lives, and the art and architecture produced by the society to celebrate its spiritual heroes. Students will be immersed in Italian medieval texts, art, and architecture as a means of understanding a vivid past which illuminates medieval civic pride and served as a springboard to the Italian Renaissance.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

It is organizationally and academically linked to the European University Institute (EUI), also located in Florence, a top-level interdisciplinary graduate institute and think tank.   An archive on the EU represents a welcome challenge for history students, since it is not completely clear &quot;what the EU is&quot;. It is neither a state in the traditional sense, nor is it limited to being an international organization. Whereas most forms of stateness in Europe and in the rest of the democratic world can be considered more or less stable, the EU is still a political actor in the making - and there is evidence that it will remain a moving target for historians, political scientists, law experts and economists for still many years to come. Thus, different from other archives, the archive on the EU does not contain documents and information on a historical process which is already completed, but which is and will still be ongoing.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Public Intellectuals: Dissent and Direction in Europe - HIST-UA 9249 - 4 points                               Public intellectuals have an important role to play in society: they are supposed to speak the  truth. They struggle to direct public debate towards clearer visions of the day\u2019s challenges and to  keep our minds open to wider possibilities and different explanations. They excel at pointing out  the common fallacies of our age. Most often dissenters, in the minority in their own countries,  public intellectuals are deeply committed to independent thinking at (often) considerable  personal sacrifice. Simultaneously observers and participants, \u201cinsiders\u201d and \u201coutsiders\u201d,  consensus builders and social critics, thinkers and occasionally active politicians, these public  figures are central to modern democratic dialogue. Not surprisingly, considerable controversy  accompanies the appearance of (many) university-trained professionals in the public sphere, and  the discussions they initiate have been characterized quite often by bitter and personal attacks.   This course examines the work and contributions of several prominent intellectuals in crucial  periods of contemporary European history over the 20th and 21st centuries, and considers  their important roles in public debate, policy-making and the political process. Their writings  focus on the important issues of their time \u2013 war and peace, economic instability, dictatorship,  European integration, organized crime, the collapse of European communism and post-industrial  capitalism \u2013 concerns that are still very much of relevance and debate today. Finally, the course  also considers the \u201ctheory\u201d of public intellectuals by looking at the writings on their own place  in society and on the models of participation that others, like them, have offered in the past.   The class has a seminar format with discussion of the principal works of a number of public  intellectuals and their biographies framing the weekly sessions. We will also explore the  historical context of these works and consider, with the advantage of hindsight, the relative  accuracy of the positions assumed in the past \u2013 did they really come close to \u201ctelling the  truth\u201d as we understand it today? The reactions of the public, of political leaders, and of other  prominent individuals are also examined to better consider the impact of these intellectuals\u2019  contributions and to appreciate the measure of their commitment to freedom and open  discussion.

Italy is well-known for being a family centered society.  What are the causes and consequences of this phenomenon? Since the 1960s, the family has  undergone a series of changes, due to the women\u2019s movement, decrease of marriages, fall of  birthrate, etc. Is the family loosing its centrality in Italy? According to some scholars, the family  is still one of the few shared values in Italy. The course will investigate the social function of the  family in Italy, from the political unification of the country to the present. We will also analyze  ideas of femininity and masculinity conveyed by the media and their connections to the idea  of Italianness. The imagined Italian community was constructed on the site of the female body  which was meant to epitomize a series of values such as fertility, health, prosperity, purity,  tradition, etc. The course will also map the condition of women and LGBT people in Italy today.

This course closely examines the political, economic, and social situations in Italy during this period, emphasizing the special conditions that produced Renaissance art and literature. The relationship between culture, society, and politics is studied in the case of Florence, in which the hegemony of the Medici house and its patronage brought the city to cultural leadership in the Western world.

Students will learn about London's changing economic and political role, and will understand how London grew to dominate the commerce, industry and culture of England. They will find out how London became the biggest city the world has ever known, and how it coped (or failed to cope) with the social and environmental problems created by its enormous size. Each week (unless there is a field trip) there will be a lecture and a discussion in which you will be able to present ideas and information gathered from lectures and from your weekly reading. There will also be four walking tours of parts of London which relate to the period we are studying at a particular time.

In the eighteenth century, Britain prided itself on the liberty enjoyed by its people, yet it was the largest participant in the Atlantic slave trade, and grew rich on the wealth created by ports such as London, Bristol and Liverpool. In the same period some 15,000 black people lived in English ports and their presence has only recently been properly acknowledged. In the nineteenth century, however, Britain perceived itself as in the forefront of the global battle to end the slave trade and slavery itself. This pioneering campaign contributed to a more positive sense of British national identity. Yet Britain continued to depend on the importation of slave-grown produce and even began to ship hundreds of thousands of Indians as virtual slaves to many parts of the world. The ambivalent legacy of Britain\u2019s past involvement with slavery remains important to Britain's multi-cultural identity and its global role today.

Through an exploration of Paris neighborhoods, monuments and museums, we will look at how the city\u2019s evolution has been inscribed on the urban landscape, and reflect on how history and national identity are imagined, produced and contested through the carving up of urban space. Major dates and events of French political history form the chronological backbone for this course, while class discussions are organized thematically from the perspective of social history and the history of ideas. Classes include walking tours and site visits in and around Paris. Conducted in English.

Opening with a discussion of the crises facing the French polity prior to World War Two, we will move on to explore the events, culture, politics and economics of the defeat of 1940, the Vichy regime and its relationship to Nazi Europe, the dynamics of resistance and collaboration, the deportation of Jews and other groups, the highly contested process of Liberation and retribution, and the wars of memory over the meaning of the wartime past. We shall analyze more particularly the impact of the violence of war upon children both in France and in Nazi-occupied Europe. Using secondary and primary texts, films and visual sources, as well as visits to the Paris sites, students will learn about the relationship of the past and the present in producing the history of this period as well as the methodological challenges of using witness accounts in reconstructing the past and will become competent critics and knowledgeable exponents of this essential stretch of French history and historiography.

Students will consider numerous issues of city planning and growth. Topics will include patterns of cultural distinctiveness, the influence of ethnic and religious concerns, and the political implications apparent in architectural design, neighborhood development, housing policies, and public space.

The present eruptions of nationalism are rooted in the heritage of these phenomena. Comparative histories of the formation of modern national identities, including the 'national awakening' of non-dominant nations, will be interpreted against the backdrop of national policies of multi-ethnic states, national programs and leaders. The major focus of the course will be oriented toward topics surrounding post-WWI Central and Eastern Europe, Nazism and Communism. We will examine the disintegration of post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, discuss the ethnic conflicts, policies toward minorities and xenophobia. The bibliography of required and recommended reading will be handed out in class, the abbreviated titles are in the syllabus. The guidelines for mid-term and finals will be available in class two weeks before the scheduled exam.

How this relationship between the globe\u2019s sole superpower and a rapidly emerging contender evolves not only will affect their state-to-state interactions but also will affect the daily lives of their citizens, the nations of the Asia-Pacific region, and, inevitably, will have global repercussions. To understand and fully appreciate the current status of US-PRC relations, and in order to envision the possible course this relationship might follow, an examination of their past interactions is necessary. To provide such a foundation, this course will survey major trends, policies, and events that played a role in shaping the Sino-American path to the present and will continue to influence the path to the future.   The format of the course will be discussion. Each week, the class will begin with a general review of the historical context of the period being examined, followed by a student-led discussion of the week\u2019s assigned readings.

The course takes a broadly thematic approach to the subject of the Irish in Britain looking at set topics each week across the chronological range. By doing so, it provides students with a wide-ranging and comparative historical perspective on issues such as: changing motivations for migration; evolving patterns of transport and settlement; shifting social and political influences; the development of differing cultural identities and expression. In addition to looking at relations between migrant and host communities, the course also explores interactions between the Irish in Britain and the Irish in Ireland and investigates how the relationship between those who leave and those who stay is reflected in the social, political and cultural domains. A strong emphasis of the course will be access to archival records and collections in order to provide students with the opportunity to directly consult contemporaneous documentation and other audio-visual materials. The course will conclude with a review of the key themes and an assessment of the current position of the Irish in Britain in relation to the wider Irish diaspora.

Course conducted in English ; readings in translation.     This course focuses on the travel experience in Modern Italian literature from the 20th Century, in authors such as Vittorini, Pavese, Levi, Calvino, Pasolini, Manganelli, Celati and others. We will analyze their fictional and non-fictional production depicting the Americas, the Middle and Far East, Africa, but also an underdeveloped and rural Italy. The purpose of the course is, throughout readings on relatively unknown texts and comparisons with the most acknowledged ones, to introduce new perspectives on Italian identity, its historical evolution, and the challenges it encounters in a new worldwide context. These lessons will offer the students new guidelines for reading Italian classics by emphasizing topics such as travel, exoticism, cultural clash, relativism and an incipient globalization.

Reviewing politics, economics, society, and culture over the past two centuries, the course has a primary goal -- to consider how developments since the 1800s have influenced the lives and formed the outlook of today's Italians. In other words, we are engaged in the historical search for something quite elusive: Italian \u201cidentity\u201d. Topics will include the unification of the country, national identity in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the First World War, and Italian fascism, World War Two and the resistance, the post-war Italian Republic, the economic &quot;miracle&quot;, the South, the Mafia, terrorism, popular culture, and the most recent political and social developments, including Italy and the European Union. Lectures combine with readings and films (taking advantage of Italy\u2019s magnificent post-war cinema).

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict.

Students are expected to master the distinctive characteristics of such genres as favola in musica, intermezzo, opera seria, opera buffa, grand opera, dramma lirico, and the basic elements of Italian versification. Students listen to and watch recorded operas and attend performances in Florence or other Italian cities.

This broad perspective will be examined against the background notion that the media do not function in a vacuum. Thus, students will examine how these contexts, informed by the dominant philosophies and macro-institutional practices of society, mitigate or even dictate the operations of the media. As a special focus, we will examine the significance of the liberalization of the airwaves in emerging democracies such as Ghana.

Using the cultural life of London as its focus, this course aims to enable students to report on the diversity of cultural and artistic activity in the British capital across the spectrum, with an inevitable focus on theatre and live performance (classical music/opera, classical and contemporary dance) given the professor's own ongoing career as a theatre critic; other art forms, including art, television, and film, are considered, as well, depending on what is on in the capital at any given time. Numerous forms and techniques will be explored through la mixture of lecture, discussion, and student presentations, and students will be required to follow the work of several critics throughout the term even as they develop their own critical voice and methodology. At every turn, the course aims to wed the specific cultural goings-on in London during the semester to the methods and practice necessary to respond to and evaluate the work on offer.

Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Our in-class seminars will briefly introduce key journalism concepts and techniques to those new to journalism and reinforce and further develop these skills for experienced journalism students. During each in-class seminar we will also discuss set readings, and explore the environment beat, reading stories that have been reported in Australia and around the world. We will consider work that explores this journalistic tradition, its forms and its themes and the place it takes in the new media world. Drawing our inspiration from great writers, we will find our own stories, our own voices and learn to tell our own tales. We will work on a class blog and each student will produce a news story which may be published on the blog, and a feature story for publication either on our blog or in an Australian or international print or digital outlet.

The course aims to develop the students' interest in, and knowledge of, international human rights; to explore human rights theory and practice; to introduce various human rights conventions and mechanisms, particularly the United Nations system; and to provide advanced instruction in several key aspects of international human rights, including the effects of globalisation on human rights, the question of the universality / cultural-specificity of human rights, and the so-called 'interdependence' of various human rights.

Yet it will do so not as part of a purely academic exercise but in order to answer some very practical philosophical questions, such as: Why isn't law the same thing as justice? Where does legality end and revolution begin? Why does the Anglo-American legal system make legal resolution into a game? Are war crimes tribunals legal proceedings or merely victor's revenge dressed up in procedural garb? Why doesn't law which is considered divinely inspired (i.e. the Old and New Testaments) serve as a legitimate basis of law in the West? The aim of this course is to show how understanding the nature and sources of law can help us understand real-world events and issues. By the end of the course students will have an appreciation of the limits of law and how law fits into the fabric of society alongside other norms, such as morality and religion. Students should also learn to identify interconnections and relationships between ideas in seemingly disparate areas of thought.

We will consider how to compare American and Chinese governance systems, and whether and how concepts can be translated between them\u2014so that the countries, and their citizens can learn from, and cooperate with, one another. In the process, we hope to learn about China, but also to reflect\u2014in the light of 9/11 and Iraq-- more deeply on our own understanding of how American governance works\u2014and how it is seen by the world.

There is a central question for the course: Is there any singularity in Latin American media? The answer assumes that there is a specific relation between tradition and modernity in Latin American societies with many consequences for mass culture and media. The constitution of mass audiences in societies where literacy was not a universal value, made significant the development of audiovisual media. The course will focus on melodrama as a configuration that made possible the emergence of specific genres in Latin American cinema, radio and television. Particularly, the \u201ctelenovela\u201d is simultaneously an aesthetic, industrial and audience phenomenon with local and global circulation. Finally, the course will discuss the role of media in dictatorship and democratic processes. Censorship and alternative media enabled many different practices for radio journalists, filmmakers or contemporary bloggers.

Students will explore factors shaping modern media texts, including: politics, economics, technology, and cultural traditions. The dominant critical perspectives that contribute to our understanding of media will be read, discussed, and employed. The course has three broad objectives: Develop a critical awareness of media environments, develop a familiarity with concepts, themes and theoretical approaches of media criticism, and the terms associated with these approaches, and develop an ability to adopt and adapt these frameworks in your own analyses of mediated communication. Students' active class participation is vital to this process. Active participation includes listening, building on what others say, asking questions, advancing reasoned arguments, identifying theories that are relevant to the discussion, and working collaboratively with others. Missing class and/or a record of lateness will negatively affect the final grade. An absence will be excused only in case of a medical emergency (or other extraordinary circumstance) which is justified with appropriate documentation.

A veritable buzzword, globalization refers to several newly emerged phenomena. To study it means to delve into several areas in which it manifests itself. These are, to name just the three most visible ones, the economy, culture and politics. In any of these dimensions globalization, as it is discussed in the last twenty years, functions through the media. Media does not portray globalization, but it is its important part. A study of globalization is inherently diverse and eclectic. So is this course. Students will read, watch films, analyze and discuss them. In class discussions and short papers they are expected to engage questions, issues, themes and topics connected to globalization, culture and the media. Special attention will be devoted to the impact of globalization on the late communist and post-communist world, and also to the ways by which the globalization issues are framed and discussed in the media discourse. All assigned texts and films are mandatory. Students are required to follow current events in the media (cable TV, newspapers, Internet). Class participation is expected as it is part of the final grade.

Czech developments will be presented on the background of a wider European perspective in order to make students acquainted with the basic features of European landscape of print and electronic media. Due to the lack of literature and printed sources in English language on the subject, the course will extensively exploit internet sources related to the topics.

Historical and theoretical frameworks will be provided to enable students to approach the scope, disparity and complexity of current developments. These frameworks will be supplemented with the latest media news and developments. In short, we ask: what the heck is going on in the hyper-turbulent realm of blogs, Buzzfeed and The Sydney Morning Herald?   Students will be encouraged to assess shifts in national, regional and international media patterns of production, distribution and consumption. The aim is to come to an understanding of the tumultuous contemporary global communication environment. Key concepts examined include: the advent of social media; the radical implications of globalisation; the disruption of established information flows and emergence of new information channels; the ethics, law and regulation of modern media; and trends in communication and information technologies. Issues addressed include: the rise of celebrity culture; the challenges facing the entertainment industry; and the rise, rise and potential demise of Rupert Murdoch. The focus will be international, with an emphasis on Australia.   Ultimately, the course will examine the ways in which global communication is undergoing a paradigm shift, as demonstrated by the Arab spring and the creeping dominance of Google, Facebook and Twitter. In other words: students, I\u2019ve a feeling we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.

African cities are fast joining the ranks of mega-cities, global market hubs and centers for political and cultural exchange. This phenomenon raises important questions that form the basis for this course. Are these cities merely the products of globalization, or do their roots lie in pre-colonial tradition? Are global cities a new phenomenon in Africa, or can we find traces of earlier international links? What factors define the spatial geography and political economy of urban Africa? What challenges do African governments face in managing the city? How has the architecture and the arts of the African city been influenced by external connections?   This course examines those factors that have shaped Accra throughout history. While the emphasis of the course is on Accra, the course also introduces the main theoretical debates across disciplinary fields in the comparative study of the city. Students will be challenged to utilize primary resources such as national archives and special collection libraries, maps, and various cultural resources to address some of the questions being posed.

At NYU Berlin, the course includes American (I), European, and in particular German (II), as well as global movements (III).                                                                        Global Connections: Berlin Trends - SCA-UA 9634 - 4 points                               This course examines diverse current urban trends in Berlin and their connections to  worldwide phenomena. It focuses on the way that different social groups (according to  class, milieu, origin, gender or sexuality) appropriate urban space and constitute  place-specific identities.  It uses the city of Berlin with its multiple layers of history as a laboratory for  contemporary urban research with historical, empirical and theoretical material. We will  study key debates on urban developments, partly as field visits, in regard to housing,  migration, gentrification, and we will search for the creative and the sustainable city.  You will be introduced to the contemporary discourses on those trends and to new  ways of reading and seeing a city.

This course, where cities are considered to be sources of cultural invention, explores through literature, history, social science and student experience, the evolution of high and popular culture, both modernist and post-modern. Emphasis will be placed on how cultures create bonds between specific interest groups, and how culture becomes the arena for acting out or resolving group conflict. This course will focus on Italian cities, including Florence. Conducted in English.

This course explores London\u2019s evolving global reach, examining its role in key economic, social, political, cultural and spatial processes and identifying the effects that these have in turn had in its own urban life and landscape. The course briefly documents London\u2019s establishment as an outpost of the Roman Empire in early history to its rise as the politico-administrative heart of the British Empire, to focus on London\u2019s emergence as a global city. Largely oriented by the work of Human Geography scholars, the course examines the unravelling of London\u2019s global connections through concepts such as urban space and place, globalisation, spatial division of labour, networks and flows, migration, transnationalism and multiculturalism.   The course is based on a mix of lectures and student-led seminars, and also includes a guided city walk and a museum visit. Lectures by the course convenor address the key themes of the weekly programme. Students are required to read designated texts for the week ahead. In seminars, students present and discuss their findings from different learning activities (readings, field walk, museum visit, their personal experience of London, lectures). Students are expected to participate actively in learning activities, especially seminars, and their participation constitutes one assessment component.

The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.

The seminar is designed to complement your internship fieldwork, exploring many different aspects of your organization and of Israel's Civil Society. Israel is a country where the government and the establishment at large have historically been very central in determining the country's political direction as well as its social fabric and political culture. It is therefore of special interest to study the emergence of new players in Israel, especially the role of the Third Sector, or Civil Society and within it the even newer phenomenon of Social Change Organizations and their effect on Israeli political and social life over the past three decades. Your goal is to finish the semester with an in-depth understanding of your agency, its approach, its policies, its programs, and the context in which it operates. You will also spend time reflecting on the internship experience itself as a way to better understand your academic, personal, and career goals.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

From the 8th century until the 17th century, Islam played a crucial role in the history of the Iberian Peninsula. Today this period is often portrayed as one of inter-religious harmony, while al-Andalus is simultaneously mourned in contemporary Islamist discourse as a lost paradise. While we look at the history of Al-Andalus and assess the importance of the contributions of Al-Andalus to Europe and America, we evaluate the significance of its legacy in modern Spain. Furthermore, we will study the protagonist role that Spain has played in relations between Europe and the Mediterranean Islamic countries during the Modern Age. Students will gain further understanding and contextualization of current Arab-Muslim geopolitics. As a case study, we will address the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, as well as its ensuing process of decolonization and the consequences that shape the current international relations between the two neighboring countries, Spain and Morocco.

More than 30 years have passed since 1979, the year when a self-styled Islamic Revolution unfolded in Iran. Historian Eric J. Hobsbawm branded this revolution as &quot;one of the central social revolutions of the twentieth century&quot;; and social scientist Richard Cottam described it as perhaps &quot;the most popular revolution in the history of mankind.&quot; Whatever the case may be, we are now permitted to use the benefit of hindsight to revisit the 1979 revolution. In the first part of the course we will review the manifold causes of the 1979 revolution in a historical perspective, tracing the social, political, economic and cultural bases of the rise of the revolutionary movement and political Islam (or Islamism) in Iran. We will then move on to situate the revolution in a global context. This will enable us to examine Iranian history since 1979 in comparative perspective as well as to integrate the revolution into the &quot;entangled histories&quot; of modernity of which it is part. At the same time we will examine the cultural dimensions of the post-1979 state in Iran. We will consider cultural production in the Islamic Republic of Iran as a site of state domination and oppositional resistance. We will suggest that the Islamic Republic is a &quot;scopic regime,&quot; developing a symbolic Islamism as a tool of propaganda and hegemony. At the same time, literature, cinema, and the visual arts have been sites of resistance.

We will go through harmonic instances of advanced chromaticism of the late 19. century and up to the very edge of tonality. Emphasis will be put on assignments and exercises in order to develop good creative and analytical  skills in harmony. Concurrently we will examine the main formal principles of tonal music and apply  our knowledge in analysis of selected compositions. We will use various analytical approaches and  test them on a large scale of historical musical material. Every student will be due to realize at least one analysis of assigned composition during the semester.

Religion, Culture and Politics in Eastern and Central Europe -\u00a0RELST-UA 9360 - 4 points                               Religion is without doubt one of the most important elements that shaped the history and contemporary face of Central Europe. Religion played an important role in the political and cultural development of this part of the world. The history of the mutual interaction between religion and politics is evident in the cultural richness of this part of the world, particularly in Bohemia and Prague.   This course explores various religious phenomena that formed political ideas and cultural values of this region indifferent historical periods. We examine particularly those religious characteristics and figures that remarkably influenced the world's history and enriched human thinking. First, we study the Christianization of Central European society and the prominent role of religion in the political and cultural transformation of the medieval period. Then we follow the religious reformation process and development of the relationship between Judeo-Christian tradition and the secular world in the early modern period. Finally, we explore the policies of communist regimes in the spheres of religion and culture and study the struggle of Christian churches against communist totalitarianism. The transformation of Catholicism in the 1960s is also examined together with the role of religion in post-communist society.   Excursions to significant historical and religious sights are an important part of the course.

Some extracts from some classic texts will be engaged \u2013 Plato, Descartes and John Stuart Mill, for example \u2013 and contemporary approaches will be addressed. Questions include: What am I? Is free will an illusion? What is knowledge? Is belief in God rational? and Whom ought I to save? In discussing these questions, important distinctions will be introduced and there will be attention to rigorous argument, including the nature of deductively sound argument.   The classes will involve informal instruction and discussion, with a focus upon clarity and argument over a range of topics, though also, it is hoped, with a lightness of touch.

Photography has become a tool to strengthen the understanding of architecture, to highlight aesthetic and design ideas and to critically interpret space. This class focuses on architectural photography and the photography of urban space, both in relation to their historical roots and contemporary practice, covering the theoretical connections between architecture and photography. Through course assignments students will learn to confront a variety of challenges presented by photographing different architectural styles. By the end of the course, each student will have produced a portfolio of architectural photography.   This is an intermediate photography course. Each student must have basic knowledge of digital photographic techniques and their own SLR digital camera with manually adjustable aperture and shutter speed, as well as a flash drive to backup your work. The course is a combination of lectures and labs for a total of six hours per week.

An analog or a digital camera with manual settings is required. Students registering for this course must also register for Directed Projects Lab (0 points).   NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Student should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   Florence can be considered the historic capital of optics: as the leading center for the production of lenses and spectacles in the Renaissance, it was also a center for extraordinary experimentation regarding the science of vision. The experiments and writings of such masters as Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Giovan Battista della Porta and Galileo, among others, are testimony to the extraordinary contributions made here to the understanding of sight and to the development of devices that aided, altered or controlled vision for artistic purpose.   This course proposes to contextualize historic photographic techniques within this rich context of the history of optics. An invaluable resource for this exploration will be the Acton Photograph Archive at Villa La Pietra with its rich collection of stereographs, daguerrotypes, ambrotypes, silver prints and albumen prints. Students will thus be able to learn about these historic techniques by examining firsthand surviving, in some cases extremely rare, examples of them.   Following the inspiration of these historic techniques, from the experiments of the Florentine Renaissance artists to those of the Alinari Brothers, a firm founded in Florence in the nineteenth century and renowned throughout the world as an early innovator in the uses and techniques of photography, students will have the opportunity to explore these techniques themselves hands on. They will be encouraged to develop their individual expression through their own projects employing one or more of these historic photographic techniques. This inspiring course on experimental photography explores new possibilities of imagemaking by combining pinhole and toy cameras and other alternative techniques with a theoretical approach to representation.

NOTE: This course meets in the center of Florence. Students should allow for 30 minutes commute time between this class and their prior or subsequent class.   The course Photojournalism: Exploring Italian Society focuses on the contemporary life of Florence, a city best known as a UNESCO World Heritage site, but that is also a European city attempting to rise to the challenges that currently confront other urban environments throughout Europe and the world. The course draws its strengths from the unique resources of the program and the city of Florence. From Italian labor protests, to commemoration of historic events, to immigrant populations, mass transit and tourism, Florence has many compelling contemporary visual stories to tell. Students have the unique opportunity to capture these issues in images.

Our exploration of political theory will proceed from a  close reading and analysis of seminal texts that are presented both conceptually and,  for the most part, chronologically. The primary focus will be placed on examining the  historical antecedents of some of the foundational concepts and practices that  distinguish our political behavior and institutions today. While taking account of the  historical complexities and stylized conventions of each text, the course will highlight  the recurrent themes that animate these influential writings and continue to shape our  contemporary understanding of politics. In particular, the lectures and discussions will  be geared towards tracing the conceptual underpinnings of current forms of political  organization, such as the nation-state and liberal democracy, and their effects on the  concerns of law, justice and morality. Some of the critical issues to be discussed  include the divergent views of human nature and ideal society, the structure of  authority and sovereignty, states of emergency, the defense of liberty, equality and  justice, and the different models of democratic practice.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

Covering in parallel the evolution of the international system and the changing position of the region in that same system, the course attempts to reinterpret the frameworks of analysis as perceived from the Western Hemisphere. The student will be provided with a Latin American view of the main economic developments and political processes that have given shape to each stage in time- to the structure and dynamics of the international system. The ultimate goal is to make students aware that where you stand depends on where you sit by exposing them to alternate views on concepts they are already familiar with.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.

It has 27 states and 500 million people. Its GNP is more or less equal to that of the USA. Many of its members share a common currency and a common monetary policy. Yet it is a union without a state. The spectacular progress in the area of economic integration has not been matched by the creation of a common government and a common identity. The economic giant is still a political dwarf as it has been confirmed time and again whenever there is an international crisis,. Yet so far this strange entity has been working. Its achievements in the economic arena have been remarkable. The course will analyze in an interdisciplinary fashion the making of the Union, its institutions, its policies and its prospects in the very challenging environment of today. Probably more so than in any other period in its history the survival of the Union, as we have known it, will be tested by the impact of the most serious crisis of the post-war period. Particular attention will be given to the new economic governance established by the Union in responding to the problems posed by the poor economic and financial performance of some of its members, i.e. the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain).

As a way of cutting into this vast topic, we specifically focus on the process of democratic transition by analyzing the democratic revolution that has swept the globe during the last thirty-five years. In turn we will explore the causes of democratization, threats to democratization, and factors that may aid in a successful consolidation of democracy. As part of this process, students will be exposed to a wide range of topics in comparative politics, including theories of democratic transitions, the politics of economic reform, voting, parties, and electoral systems, and theories of ethnic conflict.   Please note: this course fulfills the requirement for a \u201ccore\u201d course for Politics majors, the first time such a course has been offered at NYU-Florence, and is taught by Professor Tucker, who normally teaches the course in New York. As such, it is to date the only opportunity *anywhere* to take a politics core course in a small class format. As an introductory course, it is also perfectly appropriate for non-politics majors as well.

Considers recent developments in both the theory and practice of peacebuilding demonstrating the differing ways in which particular conflicts tend to be viewed by participants, external commentators and policy-makers. Students will also undertake their own research on a case study of conflict.   The course will be taught in the form of an informal lecture and a class discussion, and students will present preliminary versions of their case studies to the class. A visiting speaker from an organisation dealing with issues of violent conflict and peace will also participate in one of the sessions (to be arranged).

Beginning with an analysis of the effects of anthropogenic industrial carbon dioxide gas emissions on the Earth system as derived from the scientific evidence this course attempts to understand the reaction of the global, European and Spanish political governance systems to these transformations. In order to understand something as apparently specific as the impact of climate change in the Iberian peninsula and the Spanish state\u2019s response to it we must first understand, therefore, how the United Nations and the European Union are responding to climate change since the Spanish political system\u2019s control and mitigation policies are largely determined by these two larger governance systems\u2019 responses.

Men, women and children are left homeless and vulnerable, and domestic infrastructure and institutions are often completely destroyed. Frequently, the people affected tend to live in countries that lack the autonomous capacities to pursue development without the assistance of international development agencies, foreign governments and NGOs. The development of a country requires a multi-layered approach, taking into account the diversity of failures caused by the crisis, the particularities of country related issues and, in most cases, the lack of development that already existed in the period preceding the crisis.International Development in Post Crisis Countries explores how countries develop in post-crisis periods and looks at the role of the international community in contributing to development. This course introduces students to a cross section of academic topics relevant to development, including, but not limited to, economic development, international relations, law and rule of law, human rights and gender studies. The majority of the course will focus on exploring each of these topic areas in depth, examining them from a wide array of theoretical perspectives and methodologies.

Mitteleuropa as a region produced such important figures as Franz Kafka, Gustav Mahler, Sigmund Freud, Theodor Herzl and Milan Kundera; historical personalities whose influence internationally is indisputable. We'll delve into the history of the region and on the central role played by German politics and culture from the end of the 19th century, through the turbulent 20th century to the present day.   Emphasis will be on the evolution of the concept of nationalism as well as on Germany's foreign policy in the &quot;concert of nations&quot;, especially towards its Eastern neighbors. The aim is to achieve an understanding of the complex evolution of national entities and their interaction between the birth of the modern German state and the integration of the Visegr\u00e1d countries in NATO and the European Union.

Ever since the end of the World War II, the cooperative relationship between these two parts of the world, often described as &quot;The West&quot;, has been a bedrock of international stability, security and prosperity. After the end of the Cold War, this relationship has undergone changes, along with the whole system of international relations. Recently, on both sides of the Atlantic, the talk has been about a crisis of the Euro-American relationship. We will examine the validity of these claims, the causes of the current disagreements and possible ways of overcoming them. Throughout, we will emphasize the overwhelming nature of common values and interests on both sides of the Atlantic as well as the risks stemming from a potential rift for both Europe and America. We will examine the compatibility of current European and U.S. policies with respect to third countries or regions, such as Russia, the Middle East, China, and other parts of the Globe. We will also analyze the specific role played in this relationship by countries of Central and Eastern Europe as relative newcomers to democracy, to the Atlantic Alliance and to European Union.   Sample syllabus                                                                      East European Government and\u00a0Politics - POL-UA 9522 - 4 points                               This course is an introduction to the modern politics and government of Central and Eastern Europe from the beginning of the Twentieth Century to the present. We will examine several periods, including 1). The interwar period and the development of the first modern political systems; 2) World War II, German occupation and resistance, and official and unofficial political systems; 3). Sovietization and the adoption of non-democratic political system; 4). The Communist Era in Eastern &amp; Central Europe; 5). Democratic transitions; 6) and the processes of democratic consolidation. The course uses a comparative approach, using a few basic theories of political science to analyze the Central &amp; Eastern European case. Topics include types of political regimes, creation and breakdown of democratic systems, constitutions and state systems, political parties, elections etc.   Sample syllabus                                                                    Mass Value Orientations And Political Change In Western And Eastern Europe - POL-UA 9599 - 4 points                               This course is intended for students in second and third years of study. It is concerned with the current mass value orientations and political change in the western and eastern parts of Europe. The course will demonstrate that there are powerful linkages between mass value orientations and political and socio-economic changes such as the democratic consolidation of polities and the economic performance of national economies. The course is concerned with the links between democratic values and democratic institutions. It explores the mass attitudes of electorates in a sufficiently large number of countries in the West and the East of the enlarged European Union so that it is possible to make comparisons across countries and follow actual shifts in cultural and political values orientations along a time axis. The course proceeds from an interdisciplinary perspective and uses material in the form of readings and also the results of (older and current) public opinion surveys (such as Standard or Special Eurobarometer surveys organised by the European Commission). Some emphasis is also given to current public opinion and political change in the Czech Republic, which became a new member state of the enlarged European Union of 27 members in May 2004 . Students taking part in the course are expected to understand and debate essential facts of current &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;postmodern&quot; mass values orientations and political changes in western and &quot;post-communist&quot; Europe such as materialism, postmaterialism, self-expression values, etc.   Syllabus                                                                      Central Europe, NATO and the European Union POL-UA 9994 - 4 points                               The course &quot;Central Europe, EU and NATO&quot; provides students with an overview of the history, institutional and political structures, and major current debates in the European integration process, including its Atlantic dimension. In particular, the course concentrates on the trends triggered by EU enlargements in 2004 and 2007, the security situation after 9/11 and the impact of globalization on EU economic and social governance.

The first part examines competing approaches to international politics, explains their basic concepts and rationales, and evaluates their explanatory insights. The principal objective of this part is for students to develop an appreciation of the ways in which various theoretical perspectives lead to different understandings of the structures and practices of world politics. The second part offers students an advanced understanding of US-China relations, focusing on the post-Cold War period, with a special emphasis on issues of security, human rights and economy. This part is intended to provide the means for students to develop their own theoretically informed analyses of major issues in US-China relations, such us how China\u2019s membership in the WTO affects American economy, including the quality of employment opportunities in the United States.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Diplomacy &amp; Negotiation: Conflict Resolution in the Middle East - POL-UA 9720 - 4 points                               International negotiation has become the most widely used means of conflict management in international affairs. Negotiations of international significance are today conducted not only between individual states, but also within and beyond them. At the same time negotiation practice itself is undergoing much change with changing patterns of conflict and intervention, new urgent issues on the global agenda, new actors and new emerging norms.   This course provides an overview of negotiation and conflict resolution theories and practices of international importance \u2013 bilateral, regional and multilateral. The emphasis is on different approaches/aspects to understanding what drives the negotiation process and explains the outcome. Why do some negotiations succeed, while others keep failing? Why do some peace settlements succeed while others fail? We will examine not only the official negotiation process but also the important functions of pre-negotiation, second-track diplomacy and post-agreement negotiations concerned with implementation and compliance.   While we will give many examples from various civil and international conflicts, our main focus will be on two regional conflicts \u2013 Cyprus and the Arab-Israeli conflict. There will also be guest lectures by some of those who were involved in peace negotiations in the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Sample Syllabus                                                                      Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - POL-UA 9994 or RELST-UA 9613\u00a0or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.   Sample Syllabus                          Washington, DC                                                  American Public Opinion &amp; Pressure Groups - POL-UA 9342 - 4 points                               While not required at NYU Washington, DC, we strongly recommend that students take POL-UA 300 - Power and Politics in America prior to enrolling in this course.   This class will examine the origins of public opinion research, the impact it has on news coverage, political campaigns, public discourse, elected officials, and in many cases, public policy outcomes. You will learn how to read, analyze, and critically-evaluate public opinion research; you will learn about \u201cleading\u201d and \u201ctrailing\u201d research indicators; and you will learn why \u201ccharacter\u201d attributes often matter more than \u201cperformance\u201d attributes and issue position. You will see how political campaigns, lobbyists, public relations professionals and others leverage public opinion to impact perceptions and political, policy and business outcomes. And because this course is being taught in the nation\u2019s capital, where politics and policy converge--and against the backdrop of a close and hard-fought presidential campaign\u2014we will also hear from political professionals from both political parties, congressional staffers, and journalists, who will share their insights about how they apply public opinion research to conduct campaigns, shape policy, report the news, or address business challenges.   There is an existing and established core reading list for this course, which we will use as the foundational reading for the course. Each week\u2019s lecture topic will cover the assigned reading topics and apply them to real-life examples, so that they can be more easily and clearly understood. Young people often tell me how much they enjoy politics, and sometimes ask whether it\u2019s possible for them to make a career doing politics, and what is the best way to make it happen. If you are one of those young people, this course is designed to help show you how to do it.   Classes will begin with a discussion of the reading assignment, and how it might apply to a specific aspect of public opinion research. Following the discussion on the core materials, we will analyze and discuss a political or issue poll (including tracking and other polling from the previous week, since this is the campaign season and there will be many public opinion research instruments released during the semester), and/or a guest lecturer, who could be a public opinion researcher, a campaign operative, a congressional or committee staffer, or a member of the national news media who covers campaigns.

All other students should register under POL-UA 9530. For Non-BPE Stern, this course does not count for Stern credit, though Stern students are welcome to take this course as an elective.   Pre-requisites include successful completion of one of the following courses: (1) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) at the Square, (2) International Politics (POL-UA 700) at the Square, or (3) World Politics in London. A course in Macroeconomics is recommended.   This course studies the origins, persistence and transformation of political institutions in Latin America and the way in which such political institutions interact with economic development.   \u2022 Why is Latin America one of the most unequal regions of the world?  \u2022 Why is it much poorer than the United States and Canada?  \u2022 Why did so many countries fall to dictatorship in the 20th Century?  \u2022 Why are Latin American states weak and unable to guarantee basic public services and law and order?  \u2022 How does democracy perform in Latin America?  \u2022 Why have poor economic policies led to repeated episodes of high inflation and unsustainable sovereign debt?   The course will compare countries to determine why some Latin American countries performed better than others. Further, it explores the challenges for Latin America into the future?   The course begins with a broad overview of various political and economic outcomes in Latin America such as development, inequality, state capacity, government business relationships, monetary and fiscal policy, law and order and democracy amongst others. Next, we discuss broad theories about Latin American politics in comparative perspective. We will then use these theories to understand major junctures in Latin American political history such as independence, the rise of authoritarianism and dictatorship, revolution, democratization, and populism and their implications for economic policy and performance.   NYU students at the Washington study away center will be primarily form the College of Arts and Science and the Stern School of Business BS in Business and Political Economy.

In acknowledging the urgent demands of our urban present and future, this course examines the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of contemporary cities. Because projections show that most population growth will continue to take place in and around cities, this course makes the case for sustainable development as a way to mitigate the impacts of human growth. We will explore what is, and what could be, by discussing these themes: urban sprawl, slums and slum typology, green urban planning, air and water quality, new paradigms for energy/water/waste infrastructure, green building, sustainable materials, and whole systems design. We will consider how to measure sustainability and discuss the effectiveness of sustainability indicators. We will examine governance structures, social entrepreneurship, and the power of information technology and social networks in promoting sustainable development and the diffusion of ideas. We will also highlight the transformative role of art and culture in our sustainable urban future.

Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.

Examining Czech literary history as a specific example of the European history of national, cultural and political emancipation plans to guide &quot;newcomers&quot; along the most important cultural streams influencing the face of Czech literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. The larger cultural context includes the political role of art and literature in Czech history, language, religion, social and national currents and crosscurrents, as well as its Central and East European dimension.

Four different sets of literature have been developed around this concept. The first set of literature seeks to define the concept in terms of its relationship to the changing workforce, technology and communications, culture and finance. A second set of literature debates the novelty of the various processes encoded in the concept of globalization. Another set of literature debates the changing role and nature of the state in an era of globalization. The final set of literature debates the issue of whether the economic prospects of the developing world indeed hinge on their full participation in the globalization process. This course will expose students to these four sets of literature and provide the students with an opportunity to interrogate the very concept of globalization and to debate its benefits and disadvantages for the developing world in general and Africa in particular.

The course will focus on the current realities and future possibilities of global higher education at the backdrop of its historical and conceptual coordinates. A glance at the con-temporary higher education landscape reveals ambivalent trends and directions: Excellence and internationalization protrude as paradigms that drive universities to secure their stakes in the global higher education market. National politics of education further enhance this competition among institutional front-runners by launching excellence initiatives or entering in supranational Bologna-type arrangements to facilitate cross-border academic exchange and knowledge production. Hence a range of distinct regional approaches to global education have emerged from national models and practices of education.    This course will serve as a site of academic dialogue between NYU and HU students in one classroom by pursuing the following three steps. First, it seeks to familiarize its participants with the visions and promises of global education while also paying attention to potential perils involved in globalizing national models of education. Among others, we will address questions such as: How are modes of producing and disseminating knowledge affected when education crosses borders? What does global education demand from student learners and how are globally educated citizens envisioned? How can experiences of knowledge production and education specific to one context be made operable in another? In a second step, the course introduces and compares regional approaches to global education. Different national histories of higher education yield different answers to the questions formulated in the first step. Yet, debates center around (one) global education, not educations. This tension requires scrutiny and, in a third step, it will ask students to develop an informed and critical position on the stakes of global education.  In order to make use of the unique classroom setting the course will employ independent (out-of-class) and in-class, individual and collective, analytical and interpretive formats. Students will be particularly encouraged to fully embrace the learning impulses resulting from the inter-cultural encounter between NYU and Humboldt students. The language we are going to acquire in this course is called global education. By starting to learn its rules and formulas, students are likely to see possible future trajectories of educational development and might even envision their future role in it. The class work will culminate in a colloquium at which both NYU and HU students will present their final group projects.

Berlin is a unique modern Metropolis, its alternating history with often-drastic changes  offers a comprehensive background to explore and investigate the nature of  architecture in correlation to the various development processes of urban culture and life.  Architecture is embedded in the urban fabric for which place and time serve as main  threads, constantly changing their multifaceted and layered relationships. This urban  fabric provides the fertile soil for urban culture and life, which literally takes place in various scales  between the public and the private realm, two more threads intertwined to the urban fabric.  Experiencing the city through walking, is essential for learning how to observe, see  and read, &quot;Place, Building and Time&quot; in Berlin.  Tours will alternate with classroom discussions and workshops.

European Integration is understood in this course to mean the co-operation, which EU  Member states organize in the framework of the Union, and the direction in which this  co-operation evolves. For these twenty-eight diverse countries, integration constitutes  an increasingly essential component and extension of their own state structure. It  permits them to conceive of, to decide on, and to carry out a growing number of  important state tasks in common, and under the roof of the European Union.  You will consider the milestones of postwar European integration. You will analyze the  institutions, procedures and instruments of European integration as well as major EU  policies and the distribution of competencies between Member States and Union. And  you will get acquainted with theoretical models to explain the nature of European  integration up to the present.

The in-depth discussion  will be based upon historical documents and cultural texts with equal attention to sources  from America/the US and Europe/Germany in an effort to explore and evaluate the major  theoretical and rhetorical paradigms (and the shifts therein) informing the perceptions as well  as cultural constructions of the \u201cother\u201d past and present. Moreover, the course will investigate  and evaluate recent manifestations of Anti-Americanism and analyse the ideo-logical and  cultural coordinates of current anti-American concepts in Europe/Germany as well as concepts  of Europe as a socio-cultural model for the 21st century. In conclusion, the politics of the  current US-Administration will be discussed in terms of their impact on transatlantic relations  as well as on dealing with global challenges, particularly in the Middle East.

The seminar not only delves into the origins of these prominent traditions  of modern Western thought, but also underscores their relevance in modern social  theories and poetics. Hence, the course will also include references to the writings of  their contemporaries, as well as explications of the direct and indirect influences of  Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud on other writers.

Accordingly, students will investigate different aspects of Berlin ranging from its cultural richness in the Weimar Period to the devastation of the city during World War II; from the division in the postwar period, which produced two separate literary systems, to polyphonic and transcultural texts after reunification. The course will focus on publications of canonical authors such as Alfred D\u00f6blin and Christa Wolf, but also confront the students with minority literature by Jewish and German-Turkish authors. In its theoretical approach, the course offers insights into new paradigms of cultural studies such as \u201cspatial turn\u201d or \u201curbanism\u201d as well as seeking to enhance academic skills in the reflection of gender aspects. The corpus of readings covers different literary periods and genres from realism to postmodernism, from prose to plays and lyrics.

The history of Germany in the twentieth century offers rich material to explore various approaches to organizing modern society. Beginning with Imperial Germany in 1900 and moving forward to today\u2019s reunited Germany, we will look at different ways in which the relationship between the state and the individual, and relationship between politics, economy, and society developed over five different political systems. We will interrogate how these institutional arrange\u00acments were envisioned and structured and how they were experienced in everyday negotiations. In this course, principle narra-tives and events will be situated in a European and global context, allowing us to place the concept of German modernity in a comparative framework. Lectures will provide an overview of Germany in the twentieth century; readings and in-class discussions will explore different approaches to analyzing German history and society. During mu\u00acseum vis\u00acits and walking tours, we will analyze contestations over the various attempts to inte\u00acgrate \u2013 both in concerted efforts to memorialize as well as to forget and erase \u2013 Germany\u2019s oft-problematic pasts within the narrative of Germany\u2019s present.

Each historical period has developed its own &quot;ways of seeing.&quot; Attention will be devoted to specific instances in the 19th and 20th centuries. This should allow us to discuss and evaluate the processes involved, in a) the production and dissemination of literary and artistic products, and in b) the consumption patterns affecting those same products in contemporary societies. The purpose is to discover the creative strategies by which such works are generated, the social and economic contexts in which they are produced, and the different ways in which they have been circulated and received. This will allow us to account for changes in taste and social priorities. The city of Florence, viewed in itself as a cultural product, will provide various opportunities (with its museums, libraries, temporary exhibits, etc.) for testing such theoretical statements.

We have all heard about demographic pressure, social policies, health care planning, inflation, market volatility: these are all concepts which rely heavily on statistical information. Changes have to be managed properly and in an informed way: scientific experiments be they on a medicine, on fertilizer or airbags must be planned as to ensure their validity. Total quality in production is a statistics-based philosophy of management, and if you like a commercial it is also because a statistician has provided information about consumer tastes and behaviour. In this course we will provide an introduction to the tools of statistics but most importantly we will try and understand the rationale behind statistics.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    The Politics of Organized Crime: Italian Mafias in a Comparative Perspective - SOC-UA 9506 - 4 points                               This course will introduce students to the study of criminal organizations in Italy and abroad. Analysis of real-world data over the last decades, such as court proceedings and crime statistics, dismisses many of the accepted myths about Italian mafias. We will explore the organization of mafia groups, rules and codes, activities both in legitimate business and illegal markets, and their relationship to politics. This comparative approach will help students identify those factors facilitating the emergence, migration and persistence of organized crime across countries. The course will include a review of the legislative efforts and best-practices designed to prevent and control organized crime in Italy and in the United States.

We will also refer to transitional systems outside the post-communist region. Although dealing with Central European region, we will often talk about American situation as well. First, we will face a short introduction into the history of the Central European region and its culture of human rights, and try to delineate this region. Next, we will examine the historical, national and international context of making constitutionalism and the rule of law in Central Europe. We will try to understand what human rights actually mean. We will face the debates that occurred when emerging democracies dealt with the former communist regimes. On several case studies, we will explain several basic attitudes towards the former communist regimes, its apparatchiks, its agents, and collaborators (lustration laws and dealing with the communist crimes). We will compare these approaches with those found elsewhere (South Africa, Latin America). Furthermore, we will examine contemporary human rights debates surrounding abortion, freedom of speech, social rights, the relation between religion and the state, the discrimination against minorities, gay rights, gender discrimination, affirmative action etc. We will also analyze the Western legal transplants in Central Europe and the post-communist application of basic rights. Finally, we will deal with the European Union and the legal dimension of the European Enlargement of 2004.

The course will address two distinct questions about gender identity in a globalizing world: &quot;How can women become who they want to be?&quot; and &quot;Who do men want to become?&quot; The course is structured around two topics: the first one focuses on similarities and differences between the postcommunist &quot;East&quot; and the globalizing &quot;western&quot; world. The second explores how the understanding of gender's social significance has changed in response to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe and a newly introduced free market economy, division of public and private spheres, and an overall &quot;westernalization&quot; of postcommunist societies. Students will identify dominant gender ideologies, stereotypes and myths and locate different social institutions-such as work place, labor market, politics, and family-that continue to perpetuate gender inequalities to various degrees in the &quot;East&quot; and the &quot;West&quot;. Students will explore how conventional perception of femininity and masculinity facilitates an uneven distribution of power along gender lines and how are these asymmetries reproduced, reinforced, challenged, undermined and transformed in a globalizing world. Debates in this course will be profusely supported by visual materials, including films, documentaries, video clips, internet resources.   Sample syllabus                                                                        Collective Identity in a Totalitarian Regime -\u00a0SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               This course examines the totalitarian oppression from the point of view of ordinary citizens in communist Czechoslovakia. It focuses on the construction of collective mentality through everyday official/public and unofficial/private activities, including mass parades, ceremonies and performances, work relations, children\u2019s education, housing schemes or collective vacationing. The goal of the seminar is to demonstrate the consequences of life in an oppressive regime: suppression of fundamental forms of civic interaction, such as independent public communication, and distortion of moral and behavioral norms. At the end of the semester, students will be able to evaluate the main theoretical concepts and historical events of totalitarianism against the background of specific activities, problems and aspirations of the people directly affected by life in a totalitarian system, the citizens of communist Czechoslovakia.   Sample syllabus                            Shanghai                                                  Global Connections: Shanghai - SCA-SHU 9634 - 4 points                               The main aim of this course is to facilitate a rich engagement with Shanghai. The underlying premise is that the city is a critical site of globalization. Rather than view globalization as an external force acting on Shanghai, this course aims instead to show how globalization is inherent in the city and that an investigation of the distinctive features of Shanghai -- from the abandoned factories now revived as creative clusters, to the lilong architecture, luxury malls and street peddlers -- sheds light on both the past and future of globalization.   Sample Syllabus                          Tel Aviv                                                    Religion, Politics and the State in Comparative Perspective - POL-UA 9994 or RELST-UA 9613\u00a0or SOC-UA 9970 - 4 points                               The purpose of this course is to examine the relation between religion and public life in both western and non western societies. Recently, the question of the relation between religion and public life has come to the fore again, for several reasons. First, the Third Wave of Democratization in certain Catholic, Orthodox and non-Christian societies has raised the question of the relation between religion and democratic political culture. Second, the immigration of non-Christians to certain western, \u201dChristian\u201c nations has tended to underline the Christian foundations of those national states. And third, the resurgence of religious fundamentalism in many parts of the world has sharpened the question of the relation between religion and public life in still other societies. All of these developments cast doubt on traditional theoretical formulations about both the privatization of religion and the secularization of the state. It seems that religion plays an important role in the formation of regimes and political patterns; that religious establishments and religious communities are occasionally involved in political struggles; and that religions introduce powerful symbols of identification that often mobilize the public for political purposes.

The course is designed for students who want to perfect their Spanish as they expand their knowledge regarding literature, cinema, and social and political problems that exist today within modern Argentine society. The reading of different dramatic texts and viewing of various films throughout the semester will serve to expand lexicon, strengthen grammar and improve the student's style. The objective of this course is that the students familiarize themselves with everyday language of current newspapers and magazines, at the same time as they enter into the world of Spanish literature.   The most important goal of the course is to offer a methodologically simple approximation that helps the student to develop a greater verbal and communicative dexterity. To this end, every week the students will analyze and debate the cultural and literary content texts that are to be studied and every two weeks the students will present a written composition of the topics covered in class. In the classroom linguistic correction will be emphasized along with auditory practice through the use of a wide range of materials and resources: theoretical explanations, comprehension and vocabulary exercises, film viewing, as well as exercises that highlight certain morphological aspects or grammatical usage of Spanish.

(NYU, SPAN-UA 100 or equivalent)   This course explores Tango as an aesthetic, social and cultural formation that is articulated in interesting and complex ways with the traditions of culture and politics in Argentina and Latin America more generally. During the rapid modernization of the 1920s and 1930s, Tango (like Brazilian Samba), which had been seen as a primitive and exotic dance, began to emerge as a kind of modern primitive art form that quickly came to occupy a central space in nationalist discourse. The course explores the way that perceptions of a primitive and a modern converge in this unique and exciting art. In addition, the course will consider tango as a global metaphor with deeply embedded connections to urban poverty, social marginalization, and masculine authority.

La lengua de Buenos Aires is an advanced conversation course, which seeks to make students familiar with the most outstanding features of the Spanish of the Rio de la Plata area. It does also work as an introductory map to the main problems and questions of the culture of the city of Buenos Aires. Through a lively discussion of current cultural conflicts in politics, literature, music, drama and film, the course will enhance the listening and reading abilities of the students, while improving their speaking and writing proficiency in Spanish. These said conflicts and their transformations are key to an understanding of the way porte\u00f1os speak and think. From a first section devoted to political discourse, we will move onto a consideration of its rhetorical precedents in argentine literature. This will give us the critical tools we need to further our inquiries in other fields such as rock, drama, journalism and film.

Prerequisites for SPAN-UA 9762: SPAN-UA 200 or may be taken concurrently with SPAN-UA 9200   This course is designed to introduce students to some of the most important problems and debates about Latin American history, society and culture. Latin America is a complex region full of contrasts. Its population is both racially and culturally heterogeneous. Its many countries share some common cultural roots and political origins, but also have distinct histories. The structure of this course is primarily chronological but also thematic. We will start with the Conquest and its legacies and we will end with the problems that we experience today in big cities in Latin America. The course favors a multi-disciplinary approach, and therefore we will use a different array of materials including films, letters, photographs and essays. We will emphasize first hand accounts of the topics we discuss.   Sample Syllabus                                                                    Borges and Argentine Literature -\u00a0SPAN-UA\u00a09845 - 4 points                               Prerequisite: Open to students who have completed SPAN-UA 200 Critical Approaches (or equivalent), or to students enrolled concurrently in SPAN-UA 9200.     The course is designed to introduce students to the work of Jorge Luis Borges, one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century. Through reading, analysis, and discussion of short fiction or poems and critical bibliography, the students will examine the dichotomy civilization-barbarism in Borges works (in connection to the Argentine cultural tradition since nineteenth century); some key topics in his texts such as tigers, labyrinths and libraries; the relationship between writing and translation (specifically in the English translations of his fictions); the political aspects of the literature produced by Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers on Eva Per\u00f3n. The course will also develop the connections between Borges and other contemporary Argentine writers.

This course offers an introduction to the construction of modern Spain through the study of a variety of cultural texts\u2014literature, film, the visual arts, advertising and pop music--from the 19th century to the end of the 1980s. We will analyze the works that writers and artists have used to articulate their views of modernity and of the conflicts between centers and peripheries (in a territorial but also a in political, economic, and social sense), focusing on the following axes: Spanish nationalism/peripheral nationalism; urban Spain/rural Spain; victors/defeaters (in the Civil War); and public/private space (masculine/feminine).
