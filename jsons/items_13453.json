After graduating Magna Cum Laude from Tel-Aviv University with a double major in electrical engineering and computer science, Elad worked in the telecommunications industry for several years as an engineer and then systems architect before completing a M.A. in cognitive science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He also spent a semester at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, as a graduate exchange student.   \u00a0Lai Jiang, Economics \u00a0Lai Jiang, Economics Lai says what she likes best about Stern\u2019s PhD program is \u201cthe constant attention, support and encouragement I receive from faculty members; the opportunity to be exposed to top notch research every week at seminars; and the friendships I\u2019ve made with both faculty and students.\u201d   Jigar Patel, Operations Jigar Patel, Operations Jigar Patel, a student in the Doctoral Program\u2019s Operations Management department, was first attracted to Stern because it is \u201cone of the few business schools that imparts rigorous theoretical training, along with a real world business perspective in the field of Operations Management.\u201d   Cheryl Flynn, Statistics Cheryl Flynn, Statistics While attending McGill University, Cheryl Flynn received sound advice from one of her professors who suggested she consider studying statistics at a Business school rather than an Arts and Science school, given her background in economics and actuarial science. According to Cheryl, Stern\u2019s PhD program specifically stood out because of its heavy focus on developing research skills, as well as the chance to explore statistical research across a variety of business disciplines. \u201cI was also attracted to Stern because it\u2019s a small program, which allows for flexibility in course selection and one-on-one interaction with professors,\u201d says Cheryl.   Matt Cedergren, Accounting Matt Cedergren, Accounting Matt's experience in the Accounting PhD program thus far has exceeded his expectations. Due to the rigorous first year curriculum which immerses students in empirical literature, Matt says that the \u201cdifferences in my abilities as a scholar-in-training are like night and day. In every relevant dimension, I have grown and matured considerably so that I can comfortably interact with scholars in my field when discussing research.\u201d   Sean Taylor, Information Systems Sean Taylor, Information Systems Stern\u2019s vibrant research community is one of the features Sean likes best about the PhD program. \u201cJust about every week, there is a student or professor giving a fascinating seminar and because we\u2019re in New York City, the school is able to attract some amazing visiting speakers from all over the world,\u201d says Sean.   Xavier Giroud, Finance Xavier Giroud, Finance Xavier Giroud, who graduated from NYU Stern\u2019s PhD program in May 2011, headed to MIT as an Assistant Professor of Finance. He credits the faculty support and mentorship he received during the program as one of the main contributors to his success.   Shellene Santana, Marketing Shellene Santana, Marketing As a mother of two, Shelle knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy to fit getting a PhD into her already very busy life. However, after working in marketing in the financial services industry for many years, she decided to make the transition to academia. \u201cGetting a PhD was something that I always considered, but the time never seemed right. Finally I just decided that if I really wanted to do this, there was no more time to waste!\u201d                                                                                               Student Life     Community   Student Body Profile   Student Perspectives   Student Resources                           News      NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights to Tackle Migrant Labor Rights in the Construction Industry    Foreign Policy Association Awards Medal to Dean Peter Henry    Follow @NYUStern on Twitter and like NYU Stern on Facebook         Basics      Directions &amp; Maps    Faculty Directory    Contact Us                                 FACULTY OPINIONS    Read Stern faculty opinions on  relevant business topics             Sitemap | Privacy | &copy; 2015 Leonard N.

After graduating Magna Cum Laude from Tel-Aviv University with a double major in electrical engineering and computer science, Elad worked in the telecommunications industry for several years as an engineer and then systems architect before completing a M.A. in cognitive science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He also spent a semester at Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea, as a graduate exchange student.   \u00a0Lai Jiang, Economics \u00a0Lai Jiang, Economics Lai says what she likes best about Stern\u2019s PhD program is \u201cthe constant attention, support and encouragement I receive from faculty members; the opportunity to be exposed to top notch research every week at seminars; and the friendships I\u2019ve made with both faculty and students.\u201d   Jigar Patel, Operations Jigar Patel, Operations Jigar Patel, a student in the Doctoral Program\u2019s Operations Management department, was first attracted to Stern because it is \u201cone of the few business schools that imparts rigorous theoretical training, along with a real world business perspective in the field of Operations Management.\u201d   Cheryl Flynn, Statistics Cheryl Flynn, Statistics While attending McGill University, Cheryl Flynn received sound advice from one of her professors who suggested she consider studying statistics at a Business school rather than an Arts and Science school, given her background in economics and actuarial science. According to Cheryl, Stern\u2019s PhD program specifically stood out because of its heavy focus on developing research skills, as well as the chance to explore statistical research across a variety of business disciplines. \u201cI was also attracted to Stern because it\u2019s a small program, which allows for flexibility in course selection and one-on-one interaction with professors,\u201d says Cheryl.   Matt Cedergren, Accounting Matt Cedergren, Accounting Matt's experience in the Accounting PhD program thus far has exceeded his expectations. Due to the rigorous first year curriculum which immerses students in empirical literature, Matt says that the \u201cdifferences in my abilities as a scholar-in-training are like night and day. In every relevant dimension, I have grown and matured considerably so that I can comfortably interact with scholars in my field when discussing research.\u201d   Sean Taylor, Information Systems Sean Taylor, Information Systems Stern\u2019s vibrant research community is one of the features Sean likes best about the PhD program. \u201cJust about every week, there is a student or professor giving a fascinating seminar and because we\u2019re in New York City, the school is able to attract some amazing visiting speakers from all over the world,\u201d says Sean.   Xavier Giroud, Finance Xavier Giroud, Finance Xavier Giroud, who graduated from NYU Stern\u2019s PhD program in May 2011, headed to MIT as an Assistant Professor of Finance. He credits the faculty support and mentorship he received during the program as one of the main contributors to his success.   Shellene Santana, Marketing Shellene Santana, Marketing As a mother of two, Shelle knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy to fit getting a PhD into her already very busy life. However, after working in marketing in the financial services industry for many years, she decided to make the transition to academia. \u201cGetting a PhD was something that I always considered, but the time never seemed right.
