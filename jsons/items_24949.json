The program has a substantive focus on Chinese business law, offering legal education for students who want to become leaders in international business and gain a foothold in Asia. There are opportunities to study Mandarin, to receive instruction from top faculty in the region, and to interface with leading law firms, arbitral centers, and legal institutions in Shanghai and other cities in the region.   The courses will focus on the structure and operation of Chinese legal institutions, international business and investment transactions with China, and resolution of international disputes. There will also be opportunities for directed research.   All courses are taught in English by faculty from the region on the NYU Shanghai campus, which gives the Law School access to classrooms and study space, student services, administrative support, and language instruction.  Starting Spring 2015, the Law School will take advantage of the brand-new Pudong Campus of NYU Shanghai.
