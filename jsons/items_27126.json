GENERAL ELECTIVES (6 CREDITS)   Students may choose from any FRE courses outside of their specific track to fulfill these elective requirements or they may choose from the below general elective courses. They may also elect to register for up to three (3) classes (maximum of one 1 per semester) at select schools/programs at NYU. Students may only enroll for courses at other schools of NYU that are not offered at the School of Engineering. Please review the NYU cross-school registration policy prior to submitting cross-registration requests.   1.50 Credits Money, Banking and Financial Markets FRE-GY 6031 Studies how the interactions among money, the financial system and the economy determine interest rates and asset returns. It utilizes a consistent approach based in economics to explain the role of the financial system in matching savers and borrowers and in providing risk-sharing, liquidity and information services in efficient financial markets. Students study why and how financial markets and financial instruments evolve as a function of transactions and information costs, adverse selection and moral hazard problems, and summarize economic arguments for and against regulation. Finally, they examine the money supply process and monetary policy, in particular the link between monetary authorities and the macro-economy through a transmission mechanism involving banks and the non-financial public.  Prerequisite: Matriculation into a graduate program sponsored by the Department of Finance &amp; Risk Engineering, or permission of Department 1.50 Credits Investment Banking and Brokerage FRE-GY 6111 This course introduces an overview of Wall Street, the back office and general brokerage operations, investment banking and capital markets. The course covers subjects essential to understanding how products, once created, are distributed and sold. The course relies heavily on The Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and other trade publications. Topics include a brief history of Wall Street, an understanding of the major securities laws and how they have changed over time, basics of equity and debt securities, creation of debt and equity securities, and pricing and sale of debt and equity securities. The course seeks to understand how and where opportunities for creating new securities arise. Prerequisites: Graduate Standing 1.50 Credits Applied Derivative Contracts FRE-GY 6291 This course provides an introduction to derivative contracts with a special emphasis on current practical applications in use today by financial institutions for investing, hedging, trading and issuing. The characteristics and features of futures, forwards, swaps, options and structured notes are all covered with a special emphasis on useful applications. For each of the four primary derivative contracts, we review in these lectures the appropriate definitions, terminology, market mechanics and theoretical fair value pricing.  Prerequisite: FRE-GY 6003, FRE-GY 6023, FRE-GY 6103 and Graduate Standing 1.50 Credits Derivatives Algorithms FRE-GY 6511 This course focuses on the algorithms behind derivatives valuation and applications. The focus is on the principles and practice of financial engineering and risk management and on developing intuition: understanding the reasons for the existence of the product, simulating possible paths and possible parameter values as an exploratory process, approximating complex derivatives as a combination of simpler ones, and attempting to replicate the payout. The goal is to prepare you to be able to evaluate an arbitrary derivative given only its term sheet. To that end, the course requires a project almost every week. Projects can be done in any programming language (Excel, Mathematica, R, Python, etc.), but the final result must be stand-alone tables and graphs. The primary prerequisite is familiarity with standard option pricing and Greeks. A portion of the final exam may involve a live computation project. Prerequisite: FRE-GY 6123 and Graduate Standing 1.50 Credits Asset-Backed Securities and Securitization FRE-GY 6571 This course examines essential contributions in this field and provides a comprehensive coverage of financial securitization and their application to major asset-backed securities, structuring issues and relative value analysis. Topics include the expanding frontiers of asset securitization; introduction to ABS accounting; trends in the structuring of ABSs; and prepayment nomenclature in the ABS market. Prerequisites: FRE-GY 6411, FRE-GY 6511 and Graduate Standing 1.50 Credits Basel 3 & Banking Assets Management FRE-GY 6731 This course addresses financial risk management and particularly focuses on Basel 3 directives and Value at Risk (VaR), a method to assess risk that employs standard statistical techniques routinely used in other fields. VaR analysis is used by bank and corporate managers and by financial market regulators.
